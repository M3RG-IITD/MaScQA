To understand the concept of the neutral point in rolling, let’s consider a simple scenario, where we have a sheet or strip in contact with a cylindrical roll. At this point, it is important to note that the surface velocity of the roll is different from the velocity of the sheet or strip. This is because the sheet or strip has a linear velocity, whereas the roll has a rotational velocity. 

Now, let’s try to find out the neutral point in rolling. The neutral point is defined as the point along the surface of contact between the roll and the sheet, where the velocity of the sheet is equal to the velocity of the roll. At this point, there is no relative velocity between the two surfaces, and hence no slipping occurs. This is an important concept in rolling, as it helps to reduce the wear and tear on the surfaces and ensure uniform thickness of the sheet or strip.

Let’s now try to find out the answer to the given question:

Q. Neutral point in rolling is defined as the point along the surface of contact between the roll and the sheet, where the surface velocity of the roll is:

(A) zero
(B) half the velocity of the sheet
(C) twice the velocity of the sheet
(D) equal to the velocity of the sheet

As explained above, the neutral point is defined as the point along the surface of contact between the roll and the sheet, where the velocity of the sheet is equal to the velocity of the roll. Therefore, the correct answer is option D, i.e., equal to the velocity of the sheet.
