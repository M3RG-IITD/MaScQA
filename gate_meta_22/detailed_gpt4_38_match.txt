Let's analyze each mineral processing operation in Column I and match it with the corresponding physical principle in Column II.

(P) Flotation:
Flotation is a mineral processing technique where particles are separated based on their hydrophobicity or their ability to repel water. Hydrophobic particles attach themselves to air bubbles and float to the surface, while hydrophilic particles sink to the bottom. So, P corresponds to 2.

(Q) Jigging:
Jigging is a separation technique that uses pulsating water to separate particles based on their density. Heavier particles settle at the bottom, while lighter particles are moved upwards by the water current. The difference in initial acceleration of the particles is the primary principle on which jigging works. So, Q corresponds to 4.

(R) Tabling:
Tabling is a technique where particles flow across an inclined table and are separated based on their velocities. The table oscillates, causing particles to move in different directions depending on their size and density. So, the difference in speed of lateral movements is the primary principle behind tabling. Therefore, R corresponds to 1.

(S) Comminution:
Comminution is the process of breaking down large particles into smaller ones through various means like crushing, grinding, and milling. It's based on the different behaviors of particles under size reduction forces. So, S corresponds to 3, as it's based on the difference in size reduction.

Thus, combining the matched principles, we get the correct option as: (A) P - 2, Q - 4, R - 1, S - 3.
