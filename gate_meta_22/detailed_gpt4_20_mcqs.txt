Let's analyze each of the materials in Column II:

1. Diamond: Diamond is an allotrope of carbon, which consists of carbon atoms bonded to four other carbon atoms in a tetrahedral arrangement. The bonds between carbon atoms are strong covalent bonds. So, 1 corresponds to (Q) Covalent.

2. Silver: Silver is a metal, and its bonding is characterized by a sea of electrons that are free to move through the lattice, hence forming metallic bonds. So, 2 corresponds to (R) Metallic.

3. NaCl: Sodium chloride (NaCl) is an ionic compound formed from the electrostatic attraction between positively charged sodium cations (Na+) and negatively charged chloride anions (Cl-). So, 3 corresponds to (P) Ionic.

4. Solid argon: Solid argon is an example of a simple molecular solid. The atoms of argon are held together by weak van der Waals forces (which are also known as London dispersion forces or secondary bonding) because argon atoms are nonpolar and not capable of forming covalent bonds. So, 4 corresponds to (S) Secondary.

Now, let's match the letters and numbers as per the given options:
Option (D) P – 3, Q – 1, R – 2, S – 4 matches our analysis:

- P (Ionic) matches with 3 (NaCl)
- Q (Covalent) matches with 1 (Diamond)
- R (Metallic) matches with 2 (Silver)
- S (Secondary) matches with 4 (Solid argon)

So, the correct answer is [(D)].
