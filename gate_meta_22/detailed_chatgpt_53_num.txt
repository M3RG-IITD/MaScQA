The formula to find the partial molar enthalpy of a component is:

$$\bar{H_i} = \frac{\partial H}{\partial n_i}$$

where $\bar{H_i}$ is the partial molar enthalpy of component $i$, $H$ is the enthalpy of the mixture, and $n_i$ is the amount of component $i$.

Since we are assuming regular solution behavior, we can use the following relation to relate the enthalpy of mixing to the activity coefficients:

$$\Delta H_{mix} = RT(x_{Au}\ln\gamma_{Au}+x_{Ag}\ln\gamma_{Ag})$$

where $\Delta H_{mix}$ is the enthalpy of mixing, $x_{Au}$ and $x_{Ag}$ are the mole fractions of Au and Ag, respectively, and $\gamma_{Au}$ and $\gamma_{Ag}$ are the activity coefficients of Au and Ag, respectively.

If we assume that the enthalpy of mixing is zero, we can use the given partial molar enthalpy of Au to find the activity coefficient of Au:

$$\bar{H_{Au}} = \frac{\partial H}{\partial n_{Au}} = \frac{\partial}{\partial n_{Au}} (n_{Au}\bar{H_{Au}} + n_{Ag}\bar{H_{Ag}}) = \bar{H_{Au}} + x_{Ag}\frac{\partial\bar{H_{Ag}}}{\partial n_{Au}} = RT\ln\gamma_{Au}$$

Rearranging this equation gives:

$$\ln\gamma_{Au} = \frac{\bar{H_{Au}}}{RT}$$

Substituting the given values, we get:

$$\ln\gamma_{Au} = \frac{-8300\ J\cdot mol^{-1}}{8.314\ J\cdot K^{-1}\cdot mol^{-1}\cdot 1400\ K} = -0.632$$

Therefore, the activity of Au can be calculated using the relation:

$$a_{Au} = \gamma_{Au}x_{Au}$$

Substituting the given values, we get:

$$a_{Au} = e^{-0.632}\cdot 0.25 = 0.155$$

Rounding off to 3 decimal places, the activity of Au in the melt is 0.155.
