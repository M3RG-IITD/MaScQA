Let's analyze each statement one by one:

A) Among all radiation emitted by an ideal black body at room temperature, the most intense radiation falls in the visible light spectrum.

False. At room temperature (approximately 300 K), the most intense radiation emitted by a black body mainly falls in the infrared spectrum according to Wien's Displacement Law. Visible light is only a small portion of the emitted radiation in this case.

B) The total emissive power of an ideal black body is proportional to the square of its absolute temperature.

False. The total emissive power of an ideal black body is proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature according to the Stefan-Boltzmann Law. The equation for total emissive power is E = σT^4, where σ is Stefan's constant, T is the absolute temperature, and E is the total emissive power.

C) The emissive power of an ideal black body peaks at a wavelength λ which is inversely proportional to its absolute temperature.

True. According to Wien's Displacement Law, the wavelength at which the emissive power of a black body peaks is inversely proportional to its absolute temperature. The equation for Wien's Law is λ_max = b/T, where b is Wien's constant, λ_max is the wavelength of maximum emissive power, and T is the absolute temperature.

D) The radiant energy emitted by an ideal black body is greater than that emitted by the non-black body at all temperatures above 0 K.

True. An ideal black body is a perfect absorber and emitter of radiation. It absorbs all incoming radiation and emits the maximum possible radiation according to the Planck Radiation Law. A non-black body will always emit less radiation than a black body at the same temperature.

So, the correct answer is [C, D].
