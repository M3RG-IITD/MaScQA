First, we need to understand the notations used in the question. $a_°$ denotes the lattice parameter or the distance between the lattice points, and [uvw] denotes the crystallographic direction in terms of Miller indices.

Now, let's analyze each dislocation reaction given in Column A:

- (P) $a_°$/2 [-1 -1 1] + $a_°$/2 [1 1 1] = $a_°$ [ 0 0 1]: This dislocation reaction involves two partial dislocations in the {111} planes of an FCC metal. The resulting dislocation line direction is [001]. This type of reaction is energetically unfavorable and leads to the formation of stacking faults.

- (Q) $a_°$/6 [-1 2 -1 ] + $a_°$/6 [1 -1 2] = $a_°$/6 [0 1 1]: This dislocation reaction involves two partial dislocations in the {112} planes of an FCC metal. The resulting dislocation line direction is [111]. This type of reaction is a typical dislocation reaction in an FCC metal.

- (R) $a_°$/6 [1 -2 1] + $a_°$/6[-1 -1 2] = $a_°$/2 [0 -1 1]: This dislocation reaction involves two partial dislocations in the {110} planes of a BCC metal. The resulting dislocation line direction is [111]. This type of reaction leads to the formation of Lomer-Cottrell locks, where the partial dislocations can get trapped, leading to pinning or strengthening of the material.

Now, let's match the dislocation reactions to the descriptions in Column B:

- (1) Leading partials merging to form a Lomer-Cottrell lock in an FCC metal: This description matches with reaction (P), which involves partial dislocations in an FCC metal forming stacking faults.

- (2) Energetically unfavorable dislocation reaction in an FCC metal: This description matches with reaction (Q), which is a typical dislocation reaction in an FCC metal.

- (3) Typical dislocation reaction in a BCC metal: This description matches with reaction (R), which involves partial dislocations in a BCC metal forming Lomer-Cottrell locks.

Therefore, the correct match is:

(A) P - 3, Q - 2, R - 1
