The melting rate of the consumable wire in a gas metal arc welding process is influenced by the following parameters:

A. Stick-out length: The stick-out length is the length of the unmelted electrode extending beyond the welding torch. It determines the amount of heat input per unit length of the consumable wire, which can affect the melting rate.

B. Welding speed: The welding speed determines the amount of time the heat is applied to a specific section of the consumable wire. Higher welding speed results in lower heat input per unit length of the consumable wire, which can reduce the melting rate.

C. Welding current: The welding current determines the amount of heat input per unit time. Higher welding current results in higher heat input per unit length of the consumable wire, which can increase the melting rate.

D. Diameter of the consumable wire: The diameter of the consumable wire determines the amount of cross-sectional area available for the heat to act upon. Larger diameter wires have more cross-sectional area, which can allow for a higher melting rate.

The correct answer is:

- A
- B
- C
- D
