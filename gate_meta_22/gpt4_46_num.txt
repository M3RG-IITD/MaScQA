The strain rate sensitivity parameter (m) can be calculated using the following equation:

m = (log(σ2) - log(σ1)) / (log(ε'2) - log(ε'1))

Where:
σ1 and σ2 are the flow stresses at the two strain rates (50 MPa and 70 MPa, respectively)
ε'1 and ε'2 are the strain rates (0.1 $s^(-1)$ and 10 $s^(-1)$, respectively)

First, let's find the logs of the flow stresses and strain rates:

log(σ1) = log(50) = 1.6990
log(σ2) = log(70) = 1.8451
log(ε'1) = log(0.1) = -1
log(ε'2) = log(10) = 1

Now, plug the values into the equation:

m = (1.8451 - 1.6990) / (1 - (-1)) = 0.1461 / 2 = 0.07305

Therefore, the strain rate sensitivity parameter is 0.073 (rounded off to 3 decimal places).

Answer: [0.073].
