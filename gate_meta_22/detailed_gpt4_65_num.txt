To calculate the composition of phase α in mol% B, we can use the lever rule. The lever rule relates the overall composition, the ratio of the phases, and the composition of the individual phases in a two-phase system.

Let A be the symbol for mol% B in phase α, B be the symbol for mol% B in phase β, oh be the symbol for the overall composition (in mol% B), mα be the molar proportion of phase α, and mβ be the molar proportion of phase β.

Given:

oh = 70 mol% B
B = 90 mol% B
mα = 2
mβ = 1

The lever rule formula can be written as:

(oh - B) / (A - B) = mα / mβ

We will now solve for A:

70 - 90 = 2(A - 90)
-20 = 2A - 180
160 = 2A
A = 80 mol% B

So, the composition (in mol% B) of phase α is 80 (rounded off to the nearest integer).

Answer: [80]
