We will use the formula for the shear stress in a Newtonian fluid to solve this problem.

1. The formula for the shear stress (τ) in a Newtonian fluid is given by:

τ = μ * (du/dy)

where μ is the fluid's dynamic viscosity, du is the difference in speed between the two plates, and dy is the distance between the two plates.

2. In this problem, we are given the following information:

- τ = 5 Pa
- du = 2 m/s
- dy = 10^(-3) m

3. Plug these values into the shear stress formula:

5 Pa = μ * (2 m/s) / (10^(-3) m)

4. Now, we will solve for the dynamic viscosity (μ):

5 Pa = μ * 2 / (10^(-3))

5 Pa = 2 * μ / (10^(-3))

5(10^(-3)) Pa = 2 * μ

μ = (5/2) * 10^(-3) Pa.s

5. Convert the viscosity (μ) to the desired format:

Multiply viscosity by 10^3 to get viscosity in terms of y as required in the problem:

y = (5/2) * 10^(-3) * (10^3)

y = 5/2 = 2.5

Hence, the dynamic viscosity of the liquid is 2.5 * 10^(-3) Pa.s, and the value of y is 2.5.

The correct answer is [2.5].
