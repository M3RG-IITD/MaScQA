In blast furnace ironmaking, when the iron ore is reduced to metallic iron, it is entrained with the gas and dust being generated. This entrainment results in the loss of iron to the slag, which is a major concern for the efficiency of the process. To retard the solution loss reaction and increase efficiency, modern practices are used in blast furnace ironmaking. 

(A) High top pressure: This practice involves increasing the pressure in the furnace by blowing hot air from the top, which helps in reducing the loss of heat and gas during the process. However, it does not directly address the solution loss reaction, so it is not the correct answer.

(B) Bell-less top: This practice involves using a reactor vessel that does not have a bell or hopper on top, which reduces the turbulence in the furnace and helps in reducing the entrainment of iron in the gas and dust. It is a very effective technique and is widely used in modern blast furnaces.

(C) Pulverized coal injection: This practice involves injecting pulverized coal into the blast furnace along with the hot air, which reduces the amount of coke needed in the process and helps in reducing the entrainment of iron in the gas and dust. However, it does not directly address the solution loss reaction, so it is not the correct answer.

(D) Rotating chute for burden distribution: This practice involves using a rotating chute to distribute the iron ore and coke uniformly in the furnace, which reduces the localized high-temperature zones that can cause solution loss. It is a very effective technique and is widely used in modern blast furnaces.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Rotating chute for burden distribution.
