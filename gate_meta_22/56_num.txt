Given: diffusion coefficient of the solute in the solid is 3 * $10^(-3)mm^(2)⋅s^(-1)$.The concentration 𝐶 of a solute (in units of $atoms.mm^(-3)$) in a solid along 𝑥 direction (for 𝑥 > 0) follows the expression: C= $a_(1)*x^(2)$ + $a_2*x$ where 𝑥 is in mm, $𝑎_1$ and $𝑎_2$ are in units of $atoms.mm^(-5)$ and $atoms.mm^(-4)$ , respectively. Assuming $𝑎_1$ = $𝑎_2$ = 1, the magnitude of flux at 𝑥 = 2 mm is y * $10^(-3)atoms.mm^(-2)s^(-1)$. Find value of y.(answer rounded off to the nearest integer).
