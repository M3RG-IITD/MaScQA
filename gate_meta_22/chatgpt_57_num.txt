We can use the relation $C_p - C_v = nR$ (where n is the number of moles) and the fact that for a monoatomic solid $C_v = \frac{3}{2}nR$ to find $C_p$.

At constant volume, the heat absorbed by a system is given by the relation $dU = nC_v dT$. Using the definition of isothermal compressibility $\kappa_T = -\frac{1}{V}\frac{\partial V}{\partial P}$, we get $dV = -V\kappa_T dP$. Using the definition of isobaric expansivity $\alpha_P = \frac{1}{V}\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}$, we get $dV = V\alpha_P dT$. Equating these expressions for $dV$, we get $\alpha_P = -\frac{1}{V}\frac{\partial V}{\partial P}\frac{\partial P}{\partial T} = \frac{1}{V}\kappa_T\frac{\partial P}{\partial T}$. Using the ideal gas law $PV = nRT$ and differentiating with respect to temperature at constant pressure, we get $\frac{\partial P}{\partial T} = \frac{nR}{V}$. Substituting this expression for $\frac{\partial P}{\partial T}$ in the expression for $\alpha_P$, we get $\alpha_P = \frac{1}{V}\kappa_T\frac{nR}{V} = \frac{n\kappa_T}{P}$.

The relation between $C_p$ and $C_v$ can also be written as $C_p = C_v + nR$, so we can write $C_p = \frac{5}{2}nR$. Using the Dulong-Petit law which states that the molar heat capacity of a monoatomic solid is approximately constant and equal to 3R at high temperatures, we can assume that $C_v = \frac{3}{2}nR$ and thus $C_p = \frac{5}{2}nR$. 

At a constant pressure, the heat absorbed by a system is given by the relation $dH = nC_p dT$, so we can write $\Delta H = nC_p \Delta T$. Using the ideal gas law and the given molar volume, we can write $P\Delta V = nRT\Delta T$, which gives $\frac{\Delta V}{V} = \frac{RT\Delta T}{P V}$. Substituting the expressions for $\Delta V/V$ and $\alpha_P$ in the relation $\Delta H = \Delta U + P\Delta V$, we get $\Delta H = \Delta U + nRT\alpha_P\Delta T = nC_v \Delta T + nRT\alpha_P\Delta T$. Equating the expressions for $\Delta H$, we get $nC_p \Delta T = nC_v \Delta T + nRT\alpha_P\Delta T$, which gives $C_p - C_v = nR\alpha_P$. 

Substituting the given values, we get $C_p - C_v = (2\ mole)(8.314\ J.K^{-1}.mol^{-1})(6\times 10^{-5}\ K^{-1}) = 0.998 J.K^{-1}$. Using the relation $C_p/C_v = \gamma$, we get $\gamma = \frac{C_p}{C_p - nR\alpha_P} = \frac{5/2}{5/2 - 2(8.314\ J.K^{-1}.mol^{-1})(8\times 10^{-12}\ Pa^{-1})} \approx \boxed{1.667}$.
