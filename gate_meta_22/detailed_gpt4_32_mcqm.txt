To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of creep resistance and the factors affecting it. Creep is the time-dependent deformation of materials under elevated temperatures and constant stress/force. Creep resistance is a material's ability to withstand deformation under prolonged exposure to high temperatures and stress.

A. Fine grain size: Fine-grained materials possess a large number of grain boundaries per unit volume, which act as barriers to the movement of dislocationsâ€”the primary cause of plastic deformation. This increases the resistance to deformation and enhances the creep resistance. Therefore, a fine grain size is desirable for better creep resistance.

B. FCC crystal structure: An FCC (Face-Centered Cubic) crystal structure is one of the most densely-packed crystal structures, which means it has a higher number of atoms per unit volume. In addition to this, the FCC structure has the highest number of slip systems among common crystal structures, which makes it more ductile and less susceptible to cracking under deformation. This suggests that an FCC crystal structure may be more creep resistant than other crystal structures like HCP (Hexagonal Close-Packed) or BCC (Body-Centered Cubic). However, this is just one aspect of the overall behavior of material, and other factors like grain size, alloying additions etc. play a major role in determining the creep resistance.

C. High melting point: Materials with high melting points generally possess high resistance to deformation at elevated temperatures because high melting point materials usually have strong atomic bonds, which make the material better able to resist deformation at high temperatures. Therefore, a high melting point is generally desirable for achieving better creep resistance.

D. Cold-worked microstructure: Cold working is a process in which metals are deformed below their recrystallization temperature. This introduces strain hardening, which increases the material's strength and hardness. However, this also induces a microstructure with a high concentration of dislocations, which can serve as initiation points for void growth and coalescence that may ultimately lead to failure at high temperatures. Creep resistance is usually improved through precipitation hardening or solid-solution strengthening, which maintains a more stable microstructure at elevated temperatures, whereas cold working tends to reduce the creep resistance.

Based on the explanations above, we can conclude that fine grain size and high melting point are desirable characteristics for achieving better creep resistance in high-temperature applications. The FCC crystal structure may contribute to increased creep resistance but is not a decisive factor by itself. A cold-worked microstructure, on the other hand, is less desirable for high-temperature applications due to its lower creep resistance.

The correct answer is [A, C].
