We'll solve this problem using Fourier's Law of Heat Conduction for a one-dimensional medium.

Fourier's Law states:

$q = -kA(T_2 - T_1) / d$

where 
$q$ = heat transfer rate (W)
$k$ = thermal conductivity ($W. m^{-1}. K^{-1}$)
$A$ = area normal to the heat flow (mÂ²)
$T_2, T_1$ = temperature at points 2 and 1 (K)
$d$ = distance between points 2 and 1 (m)

In a steady-state scenario, the heat transfer rate is constant along the block. To find the temperature at the interface, we'll break the problem into two parts.

Let $T_I$ be the temperature at the interface.

1. Heat transfer through Material I:
$q_I = -k_IA(T_I - T_1) / d_I$

2. Heat transfer through Material II:
$q_{II} = -k_{II}A(T_2 - T_I) / d_{II}$

Since the heat transfer rate is constant in a steady-state ($q_I = q_{II} = q$), we can write:

$q = -k_IA(T_I - T_1) / d_I = -k_{II}A(T_2 - T_I) / d_{II}$

We are given:
$k_I = 50 W. m^{-1}. K^{-1}$
$k_{II} = 200 W. m^{-1}. K^{-1}$
$d_I = d_{II} = 25 mm = 0.025 m$
$T_1 = 435 K$
$T_2 = 400 K$

Substitute these values into the above equation:

$q = -50A(T_I - 435) / 0.025 = -200A(400 - T_I) / 0.025$

Divide both sides by A and -0.025:

$50(T_I - 435) = 200(400 - T_I)$

Now solve for $T_I$:

$50(T_I - 435) = 8000 - 200T_I$

$50T_I - 21750 = 8000 - 200T_I$

$250T_I = 29750$

$T_I = 29750 / 250$

$T_I = 119 K$

The temperature at the interface is approximately 119 K (rounded to the nearest integer). The final answer is [119].
