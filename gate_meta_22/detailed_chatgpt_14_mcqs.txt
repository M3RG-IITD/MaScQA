Gray cast iron is the product of magnesium treatment. 

Explanation:

Magnesium treatment, also known as ductile iron treatment or nodulizing treatment, is a process used to produce cast iron with spheroidal graphite. This treatment involves adding magnesium to the molten iron. The magnesium reacts with the sulfur and oxygen present in the iron to form magnesium sulfide and magnesium oxide, which are then removed from the molten iron in the form of slag.

The remaining magnesium forms nodules or spheres of graphite within the iron, which gives it improved mechanical properties compared to white cast iron. Gray cast iron is the most commonly produced type of cast iron and is used in a wide range of applications due to its good combination of strength, ductility, and wear resistance. Therefore, option (B) gray cast iron is the correct answer.
