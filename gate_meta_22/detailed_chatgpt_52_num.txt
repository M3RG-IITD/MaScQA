First, we need to find the Miner's sum for each stress level. Miner's rule states that the cumulative damage fraction, $D$, can be calculated as:
$$D = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{N_i}{N_{f,i}}$$
where $n$ is the number of stress levels, $N_i$ is the number of cycles at stress level $i$, and $N_{f,i}$ is the fatigue life at stress level $i$ (i.e. the number of cycles to failure at stress level $i$).

For stress level 1 ($\sigma_a = 400$ MPa), we have $N_1 = 5000$ cycles and $N_{f,1} = 2000$ cycles (reading from the graph). Thus, the Miner's sum for stress level 1 is:
$$\frac{N_1}{N_{f,1}} = \frac{5000}{2000} = 2.5$$

For stress level 2 ($\sigma_a = 300$ MPa), we have $N_2 = 25000$ cycles and $N_{f,2} = 10000$ cycles. Thus, the Miner's sum for stress level 2 is:
$$\frac{N_2}{N_{f,2}} = \frac{25000}{10000} = 2.5$$

For stress level 3 ($\sigma_a = 500$ MPa), we have $N_3 = ?$ cycles and $N_{f,3} = 500$ cycles. We can use Miner's rule to solve for $N_3$:
$$\frac{N_1}{N_{f,1}} + \frac{N_2}{N_{f,2}} + \frac{N_3}{N_{f,3}} = 1$$
Plugging in the values we know so far, we get:
$$2.5 + 2.5 + \frac{N_3}{500} = 1$$
Solving for $N_3$, we get:
$$N_3 = (1-2.5-2.5) \times 500 = -2500$$
This negative value doesn't make physical sense, and indicates that the material will not fail at this stress level within the given number of cycles. Therefore, we can conclude that the material will not fail at $\sigma_a = 500$ MPa within the given sequence of stress cycles.

Answer: The material will not fail at $\sigma_a = 500$ MPa within the given sequence of stress cycles.
