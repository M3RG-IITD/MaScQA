The correct answer is (C) Dye-penetrant testing.

Explanation:

Non Destructive Testing (NDT) techniques are used to identify defects in materials without causing any damage to the material itself. The different NDT techniques include ultrasonic testing, X-ray computed tomography, dye-penetrant testing, and gamma ray radiography.

(A) Ultrasonic testing: This technique uses high frequency sound waves to detect internal defects in the casting. The sound waves are sent through the material and the reflections are analyzed to identify any defects.

(B) X-ray computed tomography: This technique involves taking multiple X-ray images of the casting from different angles and then using a computer to create a 3D image of the interior. This allows for the identification of any defects.

(C) Dye-penetrant testing: This technique is used to identify surface defects in the casting. A dye is applied to the surface and then wiped away. If there are any defects, the dye remains in the defect and can be seen under UV light.

(D) Gamma ray radiography: This technique involves using gamma rays to create an image of the interior of the casting. The gamma rays pass through the material and are detected on the other side. Any defects in the material will cause a change in the gamma rays and can be detected.

Therefore, the technique that CANNOT be used to identify volume defects in the interior of a casting is dyepenetrant testing. 

The correct answer is:

- (C) Dye-penetrant testing.
