Necking instability occurs during tensile testing when the material undergoes strain hardening. Strain hardening, also known as work hardening or cold working, is an increase in material strength due to plastic deformation. It occurs when dislocations have limited mobility, leading to an increase in stress required for further deformation. 

To understand necking instability, let's consider the material's resistance to change in load during deformation. If the material's resistance to change in load is greater than the load increase during deformation, the material will continue to deform instead of reaching necking instability. 

Now, let's analyze the given options:

(A) 𝑑𝜎/𝑑𝜖 = 0: This option implies there is no increase in stress with increasing strain, which means the material's resistance to change in load is not changing. In this case, the material will not reach necking instability, and thus, this option is incorrect.

(B) 𝑑𝜎/𝑑𝜖 = ϵ: This option implies that the rate of change in stress with respect to strain is equal to the current strain. This condition does not guarantee necking instability, and thus, this option is incorrect.

(C) 𝑑𝜎/𝑑𝜖 = σ: This option implies that the rate of change in stress with respect to strain is equal to the current stress. This is the correct condition for necking instability. According to the Considere criterion, which states the condition for the onset of unstable necking, necking instability will only occur when 𝑑𝜎/𝑑𝜖 = σ. This is because, under this condition, the material's resistance to change in load is no longer greater than the load increase during deformation, leading to necking instability. So, this option is correct.

(D) 𝑑𝜎/𝑑𝜖 = ∞: This option implies an infinite rate of change in stress with respect to strain, which is not a realistic condition and thus, this option is incorrect.

So, the correct answer is (C) 𝑑𝜎/𝑑𝜖 = σ.

Answer: [C].
