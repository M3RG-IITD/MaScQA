The flux of a solute through a solid is given by:

$J = -D(\frac{dC}{dx})$

where J is the flux in $atoms.mm^{-2}s^{-1}$, D is the diffusion coefficient in $mm^2s^{-1}$ and $\frac{dC}{dx}$ is the concentration gradient in $atoms.mm^{-4}$.

Differentiating the given expression for concentration with respect to x, we get:

$\frac{dC}{dx} = 2a_1x + a_2$

Substituting the given values for $a_1$ and $a_2$, we get:

$\frac{dC}{dx} = 2x + 1$

At x = 2 mm, $\frac{dC}{dx} = 5$

Substituting the given value of D and the calculated value of $\frac{dC}{dx}$, we get:

$J = -(3 * 10^{-3}mm^2.s^{-1})(5 atoms.mm^{-4})$

$J = -15 * 10^{-3} atoms.mm^{-2}s^{-1}$

Therefore, the magnitude of the flux at x = 2 mm is 15, rounded off to the nearest integer.
