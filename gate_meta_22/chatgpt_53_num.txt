First, we need to use the formula for the partial molar enthalpy of a component $i$ in a mixture:

$$
\bar{H}_i(T,P,x_i) = H(T,P,x_i) + x_i \frac{\partial H}{\partial x_i}(T,P,x_i)
$$

where $\bar{H}_i$ is the partial molar enthalpy, $H$ is the total enthalpy, $x_i$ is the mole fraction of component $i$, and $\frac{\partial H}{\partial x_i}$ is the partial derivative of the total enthalpy with respect to $x_i$.

Since we are assuming regular solution behavior, we can use the following equation to relate the partial molar enthalpy to the activity coefficient:

$$
\bar{H}_i = RT\ln \gamma_i
$$

where $\gamma_i$ is the activity coefficient of component $i$.

Combining these two equations, and using the definition of activity ($a_i = \gamma_i x_i$), we have:

$$
RT\ln a_i = RT\ln \gamma_i = \bar{H}_i(T,P,x_i) - x_i \frac{\partial \bar{H}_i}{\partial x_i}(T,P,x_i)
$$

Plugging in the given values, we get:

$$
RT\ln a_{Au} = -8300\text{ J/mol} - 0.25\text{ mol} \times \frac{\partial (\bar{H}_{Au}/RT)}{\partial x_{Au}}\bigg|_{T,P,x_{Au}=0.25}
$$

We can calculate the partial derivative using the fact that, for a regular solution, $\bar{H}_i$ depends only on the mole fractions, so:

$$
\frac{\partial (\bar{H}_{Au}/RT)}{\partial x_{Au}}\bigg|_{T,P,x_{Au}=0.25} = \frac{1}{RT}\frac{\partial \bar{H}_{Au}}{\partial x_{Au}}\bigg|_{T,P,x_{Au}=0.25} = \frac{1}{RT}\frac{-8300\text{ J/mol}}{0.25} = -133120\text{ J/mol}
$$

Plugging in all the values and solving for $a_{Au}$, we get:

$$
\ln a_{Au} = \frac{-8300\text{ J/mol} - 0.25\text{ mol} \times (-133120\text{ J/mol})}{8.314\text{ J K}^{-1}\text{mol}^{-1} \times 1400\text{ K}} = -2.180
$$

$$
a_{Au} = e^{-2.180} = \boxed{0.113}
$$
