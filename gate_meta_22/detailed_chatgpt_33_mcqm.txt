Orowan equation relates the strain rate with dislocation density, dislocation velocity and distance. It can be mathematically represented as: 

𝜀̇ = 𝜌 x 𝑏 x 𝑣

Where, 𝜌 = dislocation density 
𝑏 = Burgers vector 
𝑣 = dislocation velocity 

Now, let's see which of the given options are correct: 

A) 𝜀̇ ∝ 𝑣^2 
There is no direct relationship between 𝜀̇ and 𝑣^2 according to Orowan equation, so this option is incorrect. 

B) 𝜀̇ ∝ 𝑣 
As per the Orowan equation, there is a direct proportionality between 𝜀̇ and 𝑣. Hence, this option is correct. 

C) 𝜀̇ ∝ 𝜌^2 
There is no direct relationship between 𝜀̇ and 𝜌^2 according to Orowan equation, so this option is incorrect. 

D) 𝜀̇ ∝ 𝜌 
As per the Orowan equation, there is a direct proportionality between 𝜀̇ and 𝜌. Hence, this option is correct. 

Therefore, the correct options are B and D. 

Answer: 
- 𝜀̇ ∝ 𝑣 
- 𝜀̇ ∝ 𝜌
