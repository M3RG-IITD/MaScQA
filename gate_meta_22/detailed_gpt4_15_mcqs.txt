To solve this question, we need to find out the order of the peaks corresponding to the planes using Bragg's Law, and then match it with the given options.

According to Bragg's Law, the condition for constructive interference of the X-rays diffracted by two planes of atoms separated by a distance d in a crystal is given by:

nλ = 2d * sin(θ)

Where:
n - the order of the diffracted beam (normally 1 for first-order diffraction)
λ - the wavelength of the X-rays
d - the interplanar spacing in the crystal lattice
θ - the angle of incidence of the X-ray on the crystal planes

For a cubic crystal lattice, like that of copper (Cu), the interplanar spacing d can be calculated using the following formula:

d = a / √(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)

Where:
a - the lattice parameter of the crystal (unit cell length)
h, k, l - the Miller indices of the crystal plane

Now, let's calculate the ratio of the interplanar spacings (in order of increasing 2𝜃) for each option.

Option A: 111, 200, 220, 311
d111 = a / √(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) = a / √3
d200 = a / √(2^2 + 0^2 + 0^2) = a / 2
d220 = a / √(2^2 + 2^2 + 0^2) = a / 2√2
d311 = a / √(3^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) = a / √11

Option B: 110, 200, 211, 220
d110 = a / √(1^2 + 1^2 + 0^2) = a / √2
d200 = a / √(2^2 + 0^2 + 0^2) = a / 2
d211 = a / √(2^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) = a / √6
d220 = a / √(2^2 + 2^2 + 0^2) = a / 2√2

Option C: 110, 200, 211, 311
d110 = a / √(1^2 + 1^2 + 0^2) = a / √2
d200 = a / √(2^2 + 0^2 + 0^2) = a / 2
d211 = a / √(2^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) = a / √6
d311 = a / √(3^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) = a / √11

Option D: 111, 200, 311, 220
d111 = a / √(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) = a / √3
d200 = a / √(2^2 + 0^2 + 0^2) = a / 2
d311 = a / √(3^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) = a / √11
d220 = a / √(2^2 + 2^2 + 0^2) = a / 2√2

Now we need to find which sequence has the correct order of increasing 2θ. To simplify it, we can look at the order of the inverse of the interplanar spacings (since sin(θ) is directly proportional to 1/d):

For Option A: √3, 2, 2√2, √11
For Option B: √2, 2, √6, 2√2
For Option C: √2, 2, √6, √11
For Option D: √3, 2, √11, 2√2

Comparing these sequences, we have:

Option A: 1.732, 2, 2.828, 3.316
Option B: 1.414, 2, 2.449, 2.828
Option C: 1.414, 2, 2.449, 3.316
Option D: 1.732, 2, 3.316, 2.828

The correct order of increasing 2θ should be from lower to higher value. Therefore, the correct order is found in Option B, which is 110, 200, 211, 220.

So the answer is [110, 200, 211, 220].
