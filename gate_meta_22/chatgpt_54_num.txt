The total thermal resistance of the block can be calculated as:
R_total = (thickness of Material I / thermal conductivity of Material I) + (thickness of Material II / thermal conductivity of Material II)
R_total = (25 mm / 50 $W.m^(-1).K(-1)$) + (25 mm / 200 $W.m^(-1).K(-1)$)
R_total = 0.0005 K/W + 0.000125 K/W
R_total = 0.000625 K/W

The rate of heat transfer through the block can be calculated using:
q = (T1 - T2) / R_total
where T1 = 435 K, T2 = 400 K
q = (435 K - 400 K) / 0.000625 K/W
q = 56,000 W

Using the rate of heat transfer and the cross-sectional area of the block, the temperature gradient can be calculated as:
dT/dx = q / (cross-sectional area * thermal conductivity)
dT/dx = (56,000 W) / (1e-3 m * 225 $W.m^(-1).K(-1)$)
dT/dx = 249.33 K/m

The temperature at the interface between the two materials can be calculated using:
T_interface = T2 + dT/dx * (thickness of Material II)
T_interface = 400 K + 249.33 K/m * 25 mm
T_interface = 406 K

Therefore, the temperature at the interface between the two materials is 406 K (rounded off to the nearest integer).

Answer: 

- 406 K
