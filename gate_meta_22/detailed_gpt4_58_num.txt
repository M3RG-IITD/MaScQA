The mesh number of a sieve is defined as the number of openings per linear inch. To find the mesh number, we first need to determine the distance between adjacent wires and then calculate the number of these distances that fit into one inch.

Step 1: Determine the distance between adjacent wires (D)

The distance between adjacent wires is equal to the sum of the aperture size (A) and the wire diameter (d). We are given that:

Aperture size (A) = 74 µm
Wire diameter (d) = 53 µm

D = A + d
D = 74 µm + 53 µm
D = 127 µm

Step 2: Convert distance in µm to inches

1 inch = 25,400 µm

So, the distance between adjacent wires in inches is:

D (inches) = 127 µm * (1 inch / 25,400 µm)
D (inches) = 0.005 inch

Step 3: Calculate the mesh number (M)

We know that there are M openings per linear inch, and each opening occupies a distance (D) of 0.005 inch. Therefore, we can find the mesh number by dividing 1 inch by the distance (D):

M = 1 inch / D (inches)
M = 1 / 0.005
M = 200

If we round this off to the nearest integer, the mesh number is:

M = 200

Answer: [200]
