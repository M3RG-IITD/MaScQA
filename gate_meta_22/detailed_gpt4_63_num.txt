To find the maximum shear stress given a stress tensor, first we need to have the stress tensor values.

The stress tensor for a 2D problem can be represented as a 2x2 matrix:

σ = |σx  τxy|
         |τyx  σy|

Where σx and σy are the normal stresses in the x and y directions, and τxy and τyx are the shear stresses in the x and y directions. In general, it can be assumed that τxy = τyx.

Please provide the values for the stress tensor, and then I can calculate the maximum shear stress for you.
