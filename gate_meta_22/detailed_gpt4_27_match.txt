Let's first understand the processes in Column I and the corresponding defects in Column II.

Column I (Processes)
P - Extrusion: The process of forcing a material through a die (shape) to produce elongated shapes with a constant cross-sectional area.
Q - Deep drawing: A sheet metal forming process where a flat sheet is progressively shaped into a 3D part by forcing it into a die using a punch.
R - Forging: The process of shaping a metal piece by applying compressive forces using hammers or presses.
S - Rolling: The process of reducing the thickness of a material or making it uniform by passing it between two revolving rolls.

Column II (Defects)
1 - Earing: Formation of a wavy edge on a drawn part due to differences in material properties (typically metal anisotropy) in different directions.
2 - Cold Shut: A type of discontinuity in metal parts resulting from insufficient bonding between metal surfaces that are in contact.
3 - Edge Cracking: Surface cracks that occur at the edge of a metal part during forming or rolling due to stress.
4 - Fir-tree Cracking: A particular type of edge crack formed in the transverse direction during extrusion of certain metals, like lead or tin, having weird periodic patterns.

Now, let's match the processes with the corresponding defects:

(P) Extrusion: Fir-tree cracking is a defect related to extrusion, so P - 4.
(Q) Deep drawing: Earing is a defect related to deep drawing, so Q - 1.
(R) Forging: Cold shut is a defect related to forging, so R - 2.
(S) Rolling: Edge cracking is a defect related to rolling, so S - 3.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) P - 4, Q - 1, R - 2, S - 3.
