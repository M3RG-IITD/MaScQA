First, let's understand the Orowan equation for plastic flow due to the dislocation movement. The equation is given by:

𝜖̇ = 𝜌 * 𝑏 * 𝑣

where 𝜖̇ is the strain rate, 𝜌 is the dislocation density, 𝑏 is the magnitude of the Burgers vector, and 𝑣 is the dislocation velocity.

Now, let's analyze each of the relationships given in the options (A), (B), (C), and (D):

(A) 𝜖̇ ∝ $𝑣^2$
Looking at the Orowan equation, we can see that the strain rate is directly proportional to the dislocation velocity (𝑣), not the square of dislocation velocity ($𝑣^2$). So this relationship is incorrect.

(B) 𝜖̇ ∝ 𝑣
This relationship is in accordance with the Orowan equation, as it states that the strain rate is directly proportional to the dislocation velocity (𝑣). So this relationship is correct.

(C) 𝜖̇ ∝ $𝜌^2$
According to the Orowan equation, the strain rate is directly proportional to the dislocation density (𝜌), not the square of dislocation density ($𝜌^2$). So this relationship is incorrect.

(D) 𝜖̇ ∝ 𝜌
This relationship is in agreement with the Orowan equation, as it states that the strain rate is directly proportional to the dislocation density (𝜌). So this relationship is correct.

So, the correct relationships are:
