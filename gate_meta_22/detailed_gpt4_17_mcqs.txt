To solve this question, we first need to understand the concept of a neutral point in rolling.

Rolling is a process where a material (usually a metal sheet) is passed through a pair of rolls to reduce its thickness or to make it more uniform. The rolls rotate and exert pressure on the material, causing it to deform and extend in length as it passes through the rolling gap. This results in the change of the velocity of the sheet, as the sheet entering the gap has a different velocity than the sheet leaving the gap.

Now let's discuss the concept of the neutral point. During rolling, the roll and the sheet contact each other at several points along their surfaces. At each point, there is a specific velocity for both the sheet and the roll. The point where the surface velocity of the roll is equal to the surface velocity of the sheet is called the neutral point.

Here's a step by step explanation for each answer choice:

(A) zero: The neutral point is not where the roll's surface velocity is zero because, at any point of contact, the roll's surface has a specific velocity.

(B) half the velocity of the sheet: This option is incorrect as well because, at the neutral point, the roll's surface velocity is equal to the sheet's velocity, not half of it.

(C) twice the velocity of the sheet: This option is also incorrect, as the neutral point is where the roll's surface velocity is equal to the sheet's velocity, not twice of it.

(D) equal to the velocity of the sheet: This statement correctly defines the neutral point in rolling. At the neutral point, the roll's surface velocity is equal to the sheet's velocity. So, the answer is (D).

To summarize, the correct answer is:
[D]
