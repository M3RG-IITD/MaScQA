First, let's write down the given information:

Δ(f)G°(1873) = -262300 J/mol for the reaction Mo(s) + O2(g) ⇔ MoO2(s) (ΔfG° stands for standard Gibbs free energy of formation at 1873 K)
a(MoO2) = 0.5 (activity of MoO2)

Δ(r)G°(1873) = -120860 J/mol for the reaction CO(g) + 0.5O2(g) ⇔ CO2(g) (ΔrG° stands for standard Gibbs free energy change for the reaction at 1873 K)

R = 8.314 J/K/mol (universal gas constant)

The equilibrium constant (K) for a given reaction can be calculated using the equation:

Δ(r)G° = -RT ln(K),

where Δ(r)G° is the standard Gibbs free energy change for the reaction, R is the universal gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and K is the equilibrium constant.

Let's rearrange the equation to solve for K:

ln(K) = -Δ(r)G° / (RT)

Now, we can plug the given values into the equation to find K:

ln(K) = -(-120860 J/mol) / (8.314 J/K/mol × 1873 K)
ln(K) = 120860 J/mol / (8.314 J/K/mol × 1873 K)
ln(K) ≈ 7.71

Now, find K by taking the exponential:

K = e^(7.71) ≈ 2230.43

Now, let's set up the reaction quotient (Q) for the reaction:

Q = (p(CO2)) / (p(CO) × (p(O2))^0.5)

At equilibrium, Q = K. Thus,

2230.43 = (p(CO2)) / (p(CO) × (p(O2))^0.5)

Let's express the partial pressures of CO and CO2 in terms of their mole fractions (x) and the total pressure (P):

p(CO) = x(CO) × P
p(CO2) = x(CO2) × P

The overall reaction we're analyzing is CO(g) + 0.5O2(g) ⇔ CO2(g). Since 1 mol of CO is reacting with 0.5 mol of O2, we have:

x(CO2) = x(CO) × 0.5.

We can now re-write the expression for Q as follows:

2230.43 = (x(CO2) × P) / (x(CO) × P × (p(O2))^0.5)

We can cancel out the total pressure, P:

2230.43 = x(CO2) / (x(CO) × (p(O2))^0.5)

Now we can substitute x(CO2) = x(CO) × 0.5:

2230.43 = (x(CO) × 0.5) / (x(CO) × (p(O2))^0.5)

Now we want to find the p(CO) / p(CO2) ratio, which is equivalent to x(CO) / x(CO2). To do this, let's solve for x(CO) / x(CO2):

x(CO) / x(CO2) = 0.5 / ((p(O2))^0.5 × 2230.43)

We are given that a(MoO2) = 0.5, which implies that p(O2) is equal to half the standard pressure, since activity is the ratio of partial pressure to standard pressure:

p(O2) = 0.5 atm

Now we can plug this value into the equation for x(CO) / x(CO2):

x(CO) / x(CO2) = 0.5 / ((0.5 atm)^0.5 × 2230.43)
x(CO) / x(CO2) ≈ 0.5 / (0.7071 × 2230.43)

Now we can calculate the p(CO) / p(CO2) ratio, rounded off to 2 decimal places:

x(CO) / x(CO2) ≈ 0.50 / (0.7071 × 2230.43) ≈ 0.001597 ≈ 0.0016 (rounded to 4 decimal places for accuracy)

The equilibrium p(CO) / p(CO2) ratio for the given reaction at 1873 K is approximately 0.0016 (rounded to 4 decimal places for accuracy).
