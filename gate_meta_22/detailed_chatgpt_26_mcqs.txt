When a material undergoes strain hardening, its true stress increases with increasing true strain. Necking instability occurs during tensile testing when the material starts to narrow down along its width abruptly. This occurs due to non-uniform deformation in the gauge region of the specimen, resulting in high stress concentrations. At necking, the material is loaded beyond its ultimate tensile strength and work-hardening capacity, causing it to fail. Therefore, the slope of the true stress-strain curve decreases significantly at necking. 

To determine the condition for necking instability, we can use the derivative of the true stress-strain curve. When the derivative becomes zero, it means the slope of the curve has reached its minimum value and is about to change direction. This corresponds to the onset of necking instability. 

Taking the derivative of the true stress-strain curve, we get:

𝑑𝜎/𝑑𝜖 = (𝑑/d𝜖)(𝜎𝑡/𝐴) = (1/𝐴) (𝑑𝜎𝑡/𝑑𝜖)

Here, 𝜎𝑡 is the true stress and A is the cross-sectional area of the specimen.

Therefore, necking instability occurs when 𝑑𝜎𝑡/𝑑𝜖 = 0, since the derivative of 𝜎 with respect to 𝜖 gives the slope of the true stress-strain curve. 

Answer: 

The correct option is (A) 𝑑𝜎/𝑑𝜖 = 0.
