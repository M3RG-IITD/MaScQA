We can solve this problem using Laplace's law which relates the pressure inside a droplet or a bubble with its surface tension and radius. The formula for Laplace's law is:

$$P_{inside} = P_{outside} + \frac{2\gamma}{r}$$

where $P_{inside}$ and $P_{outside}$ are the pressures inside and outside the bubble, $\gamma$ is the surface tension and $r$ is the radius of the bubble.

We are given that $P_{outside} = 1.5$ bar, $\gamma = 1.4$ Nâ‹…$m^{-1}$, and $r = 0.01$ mm $= 10^{-5}$ m.

Substituting these values in the formula, we get:

$$P_{inside} = 1.5\text{ bar} + \frac{2\times 1.4\text{ N}\cdot\text{m}^{-1}}{10^{-5}\text{ m}}$$

Simplifying the right-hand side of the equation, we get:

$$P_{inside} = 1.5\text{ bar} + 280\text{ bar}$$

Adding the two terms on the right-hand side, we get:

$$P_{inside} = 281.5\text{ bar}$$

Rounding off to one decimal place, we get the final answer as:

- $P_{inside} = 281.5$ bar

Therefore, the pressure inside the bubble is 281.5 bar.
