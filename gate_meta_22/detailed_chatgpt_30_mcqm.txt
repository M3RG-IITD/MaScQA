Continuous casting is a process that involves converting molten steel into a solid form. This process involves pouring the molten steel into a mold, which is made of copper, where it solidifies to form a strand. During this process, a mold flux is used to ensure that the steel is protected from contamination and that it solidifies properly. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) inclusion control. Mould flux is used to control the level of inclusions in the steel, which can arise from reactions with the mold or the environment. Inclusions can cause defects in the steel, and so it is important to control them in order to maintain the quality of the final product.
