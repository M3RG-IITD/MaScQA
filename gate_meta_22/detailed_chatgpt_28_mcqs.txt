The answer to this question can be found by understanding the effect of carbon content on the crystal structure of Fe-C alloy. 

At low carbon concentrations, the crystal structure of Fe-C alloy is BCC (body-centered cubic). However, as the carbon concentration increases, the BCC structure transforms into a BCT (body-centered tetragonal) structure through a process known as martensitic transformation.

With increase in carbon content up to 2 mass%, the lattice parameters (c and a) of BCT martensite are affected as follows:

- The c parameter (distance between the top and bottom faces of the tetragonal unit cell) increases due to the larger size of carbon atoms compared to iron atoms.
- The a parameter (distance between the center of opposite side faces of the tetragonal unit cell) decreases due to the distortion caused by the carbon atoms.

Therefore, the correct answer to the question is (B) c increases but a decreases. 

To summarize:

- At low carbon concentrations, Fe-C alloy has a BCC crystal structure.
- As the carbon concentration increases up to 2 mass%, the BCC structure transforms into a BCT martensite.
- With increasing carbon content up to 2 mass%, the c parameter (distance between the top and bottom faces of the tetragonal unit cell) increases but the a parameter (distance between the center of opposite side faces of the tetragonal unit cell) decreases. 

Answer: 
(B) c increases but a decreases.
