The correct answer is:

(B) 𝜖̇ ∝ 𝑣

Explanation:

According to Orowan equation, the strain rate (𝜖̇) is proportional to the product of dislocation density (𝜌) and dislocation velocity (𝑣):

𝜖̇ = Kb𝜌𝑣

where Kb is a constant.

Taking the square of velocity or density would result in an incorrect relationship. Therefore, options (A) and (C) are incorrect.

Option (D) is also incorrect, as the strain rate is proportional to the product of density and velocity, not just density. 

Therefore, the correct answer is option (B) 𝜖̇ ∝ 𝑣.
