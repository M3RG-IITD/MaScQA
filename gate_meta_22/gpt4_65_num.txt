Let x be the composition (in mol% B) of phase α.

Since the molar proportion of α to β is 2:1, the overall composition of the alloy can be represented by the following equation:

2x + 90 = 3 * 70

Solve for x:

2x + 90 = 210
2x = 120
x = 60

Thus, the composition of α is 60 mol% B.

The answer is [60].
