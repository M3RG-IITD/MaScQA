The formula to calculate the spacing between dislocations is:

Spacing between dislocations = lattice parameter / sin(misorientation angle / 2)

Substituting the given values, we get:

Spacing between dislocations = 0.143 / sin(2°/2)
                                 = 0.143 / sin(1°)
                                 = 0.143 / 0.017452
                                 = 8.19 nm (rounded off to 2 decimal places)

Therefore, the spacing between the dislocations that form the tilt boundary is 8.19 nm. 

Answer: [8.19]
