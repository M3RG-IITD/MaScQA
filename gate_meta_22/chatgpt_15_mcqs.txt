The answer is (D) 111, 200, 311, 220. This is because the X-ray diffraction pattern of a pure copper powder sample follows the FCC (face-centered cubic) crystal structure of copper. According to Bragg's law, the positions of the diffraction peaks are determined by the interatomic spacing in the crystal lattice. The four planes corresponding to the strongest peaks in the X-ray diffraction pattern of copper are (111), (200), (311), and (220), in that order of increasing 2𝜃.
