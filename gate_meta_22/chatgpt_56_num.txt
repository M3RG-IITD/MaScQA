The flux 𝐽 (in units of $atoms.mm^{−2}s^{−1}$) of the solute along the positive 𝑥 direction is given by:

𝐽 = −$D*\frac{∂C}{∂x}$

where 𝐷 is the diffusion coefficient of the solute in the solid. 

Differentiating the given expression for concentration 𝐶 with respect to 𝑥, we get:

$\frac{∂C}{∂x}$ = 2$a_1$𝑥 + $a_2$

Substituting 𝑥 = 2 mm, 𝑎1 = 𝑎2 = 1, and 𝐷 = 3 * $10^{−3} mm^2.s^{−1}$, we get:

𝐽 = −(3 * $10^{−3} mm^{2}.s^{−1}$) * (2(1)(2) + 1) = −$15*10^{-3} atoms.mm^{−2}s^{−1}$

Therefore, the value of y = 15, rounded off to the nearest integer.

Answer: 

- 15
