The stress intensity factor (K) is defined as the ratio of the stress at the crack tip to the square root of the crack's length. It is a measure of the stress concentration at the crack tip, and is used to predict when a crack will propagate in a structure.

There are three modes of deformation that can be applied to a crack, which correspond to the direction of the applied stress relative to the crack plane. These modes are:

- Mode I: Tensile stress normal to the crack plane, causing crack opening.
- Mode II: Shear stress parallel to the crack plane, causing sliding or along-plane deformation.
- Mode III: Shear stress perpendicular to the crack plane, causing tearing.

The correct match between the nomenclature in Column A and the mode of deformation in Column B is:

- P - Mode I or crack opening mode (Z)
- Q - Mode II or parallel shear mode (X)
- R - Mode III or forward shear mode (Y)

Therefore, the correct option is (A) P - Z, Q - X, R - Y.
