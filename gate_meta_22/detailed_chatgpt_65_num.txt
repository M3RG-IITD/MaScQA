Given, 
- Alloy A-B has equilibrium microstructure of two phases α and β
- The molar proportion of α:β = 2:1
- Overall composition of the alloy = 70 mol% B
- The composition of β is 90 mol% B

Let's assume that the total number of moles in the alloy is 100. Therefore,
- The total number of moles of A = 30
- The total number of moles of B = 70

Since the molar proportion of α:β is 2:1, we can assume that the total number of moles of α and β are in the ratio of 2:1. Therefore,
- The total number of moles of α = 2x
- The total number of moles of β = x

Also, the composition of β is given to be 90 mol% B. Therefore, 
- The number of moles of B in β = 0.9x
- The number of moles of A in β = 0.1x

Now, we can use the overall composition of the alloy to determine the composition of α. We know that the total number of moles of A and B in the alloy are 30 and 70 respectively. Hence,
- The total number of moles of A in α = 30 - 0.1x
- The total number of moles of B in α = 70 - 0.9x

Since the molar proportion of α:β is 2:1, we can equate the moles of A and B in α and β to get the following equation:
2(30 - 0.1x) = x(0.1) + 2x(0.1) + 0.9x
Simplifying the above equation, we get:
58 = 3.1x
x = 18.71

Therefore, 
- The number of moles of α = 2x = 37.42
- The number of moles of B in α = 70 - 0.9x = 52.10

Hence, the composition of α in terms of mol% B is:
(52.10/37.42) * 100 = 139.44 ≈ 139 mol% B

Therefore, the composition (in mol% B) of α is 139 (rounded off to the nearest integer).
