Steel plates are welded autogenously using Gas Tungsten Arc welding with an arc heat transfer efficiency of 0.65. The first weld is made using a welding current of 200 A at an arc voltage of 18 V with a welding speed of 0.002 $m.s^(-1)$. The second weld is made at a welding speed of 0.0022 $m.s^(-1)$ with the same arc voltage. If both the welds have identical heat input, the welding current(in amperes) of the second weld is? (round off to the nearest integer).
