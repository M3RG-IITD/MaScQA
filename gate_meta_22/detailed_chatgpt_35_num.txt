The situation can be analyzed as follows:

- The two plates create a shearing force on the liquid in the horizontal direction, which results in a velocity gradient across the liquid.
- The magnitude of the shearing force per unit area is given by the stress, which is 5 Pa in this case.
- The rate of deformation of the liquid, or the velocity gradient, is proportional to the shearing force (stress) and inversely proportional to the viscosity of the liquid (as described by the Newtonian fluid model). This relationship is known as the Newtonian viscosity law, and can be expressed as:

    velocity gradient = stress / viscosity

- The velocity gradient can be related to the speed of the upper plate and the distance between the plates. Specifically, if the upper plate moves with a constant speed v and the distance between the plates is h, then the velocity gradient at a point y (measured from the bottom plate) is given by:

    velocity gradient = v / h

Using these concepts, we can write down the following equation relating the stress, viscosity, plate speed, and plate distance:

    stress / viscosity = plate speed / plate distance

Plugging in the given values, we get:

    5 Pa / (y * 10^(-3) Pa.s) = 2 m/s / (10^(-3) m)

Simplifying and solving for y, we get:

    y = 0.1

Therefore, the viscosity of the liquid is 0.1 Pa.s (or 100 * 10^(-3) Pa.s), rounded off to 1 decimal place. 

Answer: 
- 0.1
