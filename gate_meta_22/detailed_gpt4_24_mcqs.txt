Green sand moulding is a process used in foundries to create metal castings by pouring molten metal into a cavity made using a mixture of sand, clay, and water. An oversized core in green sand moulding can cause various casting defects. In this case, we are looking for the defect resulting from the displacement of the mould cavity by an oversized core.

Let's take a look at each of the given options:

A) Crush
Crush occurs when an oversized core displaces the sand in the mould cavity, resulting in the mould being compressed, leading to a damaged or misshapen casting. This defect can occur due to problems in core, pattern, or core settings.

B) Hot tear
Hot tear is a casting defect that occurs when the metal solidifies and contracts while still being hot, causing internal or external cracks in the casting. This problem is due to metal solidification and its contraction, not because of an oversized core.

C) Blow
Blow is a casting defect that occurs when gas, usually air, becomes trapped in the mould cavity as the molten metal solidifies, causing pockets or cavities in the casting. This defect is caused by gas entrapment and does not result from the displacement of the mould cavity by an oversized core.

D) Fin
Fin is a casting defect that occurs when the molten metal leaks out of the mould cavity through a gap or joint, forming a thin projection on the surface of the casting. This defect is caused by improper sealing of the mould or issues with the mould design, not because of an oversized core.

From the given options, the casting defect resulting from the displacement of the mould cavity by an oversized core is:

A) Crush
