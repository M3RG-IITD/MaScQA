Given the concentration C of a solute in a solid along the x direction follows the expression: 
C = $a_1 * x^2$ + $a_2 * x$.

We know the diffusion coefficient, D, is given as 3 * $10^{-3} mm^2/s$.

Now, we apply Fick's first law of diffusion, which states that the flux, J, is proportional to the negative gradient of concentration, that is:

J = -D * dC/dx.

First, we need to find the derivative of C with respect to x:

dC/dx = d($a_1 * x^2$ + $a_2 * x$)/dx

Given $a_1 = a_2 = 1$, our expression becomes:

C = $x^2 + x$

Now, we need to derivate C with respect to x:

dC/dx = d($x^2 + x$)/dx = $2x + 1$

Now, let's plug this expression for dC/dx and the value of D into the Fick's first law equation and calculate the flux:

J = -D * dC/dx = - (3 * $10^{-3}$) * (2x + 1)

Now, we need to calculate the magnitude of the flux (J) at x = 2 mm:

J = - (3 * $10^{-3}$) * (2 * 2 + 1) = -(3 * $10^{-3}$) * 5

J = -15 * $10^{-3}$ $atoms.mm^{-2}.s^{-1}$ 

Magnitude of flux is positive, so we have:

|J| = 15 * $10^{-3}$ $atoms.mm^{-2}.s^{-1}$ 

So y = 15 (rounded off to the nearest integer).

The magnitude of the flux at ùë• = 2mm is 15 * $10^(-3)atoms.mm^(-2)s^(-1)$.
