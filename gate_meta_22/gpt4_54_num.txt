To find the temperature at the interface between the two materials, we can use the equation for heat transfer by conduction (Fourier's law):

$Q = kA \frac{ΔT}{d}$

where:
- $Q$ is the heat transfer rate per unit area (W/m²)
- $k$ is the thermal conductivity of the material (W/m·K)
- $d$ is the thickness of the material (m)
- $ΔT$ is the temperature difference across the material (K)

Since the heat transfer rate per unit area ($Q$) is the same across both materials (in steady state), we can equate the Fourier's law equations for Material I and Material II:

$k_IA\frac{ΔT_1}{d_1}=k_IIA\frac{ΔT_2}{d_2}$

Knowing the given values:

Material I:
- $k_I = 50$ W/m·K
- $d_1 = 0.025$ m
- $ΔT_1 = T_{interface} - T_{bottom} = T_{interface} - 435$ K

Material II:
- $k_{II} = 200$ W/m·K
- $d_2 = 0.025$ m
- $ΔT_2 = T_{top} - T_{interface} = 400 - T_{interface}$ K

Now, let's plug in the values into the equation:

$50A\frac{T_{interface} - 435}{0.025}=200A\frac{400 - T_{interface}}{0.025}$

We can simplify the equation and solve for T_interface:

$\frac{T_{interface} - 435}{1}=\frac{400 - T_{interface}}{4}$

Multiplying both sides by 4:

$4(T_{interface} - 435) = 400 - T_{interface}$

Expand and simplify:

$4T_{interface} - 1740 = 400 - T_{interface}$

Add $T_{interface}$ to both sides:

$5T_{interface} = 2140$

Divide by 5:

$T_{interface} = 428$ K

Therefore, the temperature at the interface is approximately 428 K.

Answer: [428].
