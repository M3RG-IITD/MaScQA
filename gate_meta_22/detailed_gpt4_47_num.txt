To solve this problem, we need to use the Young-Laplace equation for the pressure difference between the inside and outside of a curved surface, such as a bubble:

ΔP = 2 * T / R,

where ΔP is the pressure difference, T is the surface tension, and R is the radius of the bubble.

Step 1: Given values
Surface tension T = 1.4 N/m
Radius given as R = 0.01 mm. Let's convert it to meters.
R = 0.01 * 10^(-3) m.
Pressure outside the bubble P_outside = 1.5 bar
1 bar = 10^5 Pascal (Pa). Let's convert the outside pressure into Pa.
P_outside = 1.5 * 10^5 Pa.

Step 2: Calculate the pressure difference
ΔP = 2 * T / R 
ΔP = 2 * 1.4 N/m  /  (0.01 * 10^(-3) m)
ΔP = 280000 Pa

Step 3: Calculate the pressure inside the bubble
P_inside = ΔP + P_outside
P_inside = 280000 Pa + 1.5 * 10^5 Pa
P_inside = 430000 Pa

Step 4: Convert the pressure inside the bubble to bar
1 bar = 10^5 Pa
P_inside = 430000 Pa * (1 bar / 10^5 Pa)
P_inside = 4.3 bar

So, the pressure inside the bubble is 4.3 bar.

Answer: [4.3]
