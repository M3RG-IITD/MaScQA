The Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) is a steelmaking process that involves the conversion of pig iron from the blast furnace into steel. The process uses oxygen to remove impurities such as carbon, silicon, sulfur, and phosphorus from hot metal (molten iron). Let's analyze each element's removal rate in basic oxygen furnace steelmaking.

(A) Carbon: The primary function of the BOF process is to reduce the carbon content in hot metal. Oxygen injected into the furnace reacts with the carbon to produce carbon monoxide, which then escapes as gas. Carbon has a comparatively fast removal rate.

(B) Sulfur: The BOF process is not very efficient at removing sulfur. Most of the sulfur removal occurs before the steelmaking process, through desulfurization of hot metal. Lime (calcium oxide) used as a flux in BOF reacts with sulfur to form calcium sulfide, which is absorbed by slag. However, this reaction is not very fast and efficient, so the removal rate of sulfur is relatively slow.

(C) Silicon: The BOF process effectively removes silicon by oxidizing it to silicon dioxide. Silicon reacts with oxygen and is absorbed into the slag. The removal rate of silicon is relatively fast.

(D) Phosphorus: Phosphorus reacts with oxygen and lime to form phosphates, which are absorbed by the slag. However, the removal of phosphorus in BOF is very slow due to the high affinity of phosphorus for iron. It requires very high basicity slag to remove phosphorus effectively. Therefore, the removal rate of phosphorus is slower than carbon and silicon but faster than sulfur.

In summary, the removal rates of the elements in basic oxygen furnace steelmaking are as follows:
- Carbon: Fast
- Silicon: Fast
- Phosphorus: Slow
- Sulfur: Very Slow

Hence, the correct answer is:
[B] Sulfur
