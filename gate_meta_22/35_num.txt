A Newtonian incompressible liquid is contained between two parallel metal plates separated by $10^(-3)$ m (see figure). A stress of 5 Pa is required to maintain the upper plate in motion with a constant speed of 2 m.$s^(-1)$ in the horizontal direction relative to the bottom plate. The viscosity of liquid contained between the plates is y * $10^(-3)$ Pa.s. Find y. (answer rounded off to 1 decimal place).
