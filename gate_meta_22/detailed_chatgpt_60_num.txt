Given:
Diameter of cylindrical specimen before extrusion (D1) = 30 mm
Diameter of cylindrical specimen after extrusion (D2) = 20 mm
Flow behavior equation: 𝜎 = 350 $𝜖^(0.3)$ MPa

We need to find the ideal plastic work of deformation per unit volume.

Let us assume the height of the cylindrical specimen before extrusion be 'h'
Volume of cylindrical specimen before extrusion = π(D1/2)^2 * h
Volume of cylindrical specimen after extrusion = π(D2/2)^2 * h
Since volume before and after extrusion is same, we can equate the above two equations.
π(D1/2)^2 * h = π(D2/2)^2 * h
Simplifying the above equation, we get:
h = (D1/D2)^2 * h

Now, let us consider an elemental thickness 'dx' of the extruded material.
Cross-sectional area of the elemental thickness = π(D2/2)²
Total plastic work of deformation per unit volume = ∫(𝜎*ɛ)dɛ (integrated from 0 to 𝜀f)
where 𝜎 is the stress and ɛ is the strain.

From the given flow behavior equation, 𝜎 = 350 $𝜖^(0.3)$ MPa
𝜀f can be easily calculated using the formula for cold extrusion strain:
𝜀f = ln(D1/D2)

Substituting 𝜎 and 𝜀f in the plastic work equation, we get:
Total plastic work of deformation per unit volume = ∫0^(ln(D1/D2)) (350 𝜖^(0.3) * 𝜖)d𝜖

Solving the above integral, we get:
Total plastic work of deformation per unit volume = [35/3 * (e^(3ln(D1/D2)/10) - 1)] mega joules/m^3

Substituting the given values, we get:
Total plastic work of deformation per unit volume = [35/3 * (e^(3ln(30/20)/10) - 1)] mega joules/m^3
Total plastic work of deformation per unit volume = 437 mega joules/m^3 (rounded off to the nearest integer)

Therefore, the ideal plastic work of deformation per unit volume is 437 MJ/m^3.
