During basic oxygen furnace (BOF) steelmaking, the removal rate of different elements from hot metal depends on their respective reactivity with the oxidizing agents (usually oxygen and/or lime). The more reactive an element is, the faster it is removed from the hot metal. 

In this case, out of the given options, the element with the slowest removal rate from hot metal in a BOF process would be the one that is the least reactive with the oxidizing agents. 

(A) Carbon is oxidized easily in a BOF process, so it has a relatively fast removal rate. 

(B) Sulfur also has a relatively fast removal rate since it forms volatile sulfur dioxide gas easily. 

(C) Silicon is less reactive than carbon and sulfur, but still reacts with the oxidizing agents to form silica (SiO2), so it has a moderate removal rate. 

(D) Phosphorus is the element with the slowest removal rate among the given options. It is not easily oxidized in a BOF process, and tends to form phosphorus oxide (P2O5) which has a high melting point and forms stable slag. Therefore, phosphorus tends to accumulate in the hot metal, and extra measures need to be taken to reduce its content. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Phosphorus.
