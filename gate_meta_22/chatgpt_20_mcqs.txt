The correct answer is:

(C) P – 3, Q – 1, R – 4, S – 2

Explanation:

- Diamond is a covalent network solid, so it has covalent bonding (Q).
- Silver is a metallic element, so it has metallic bonding (R).
- NaCl is an ionic compound, so it has ionic bonding (P).
- Solid argon is a noble gas, so it has van der Waals forces (also known as London dispersion forces), which are a type of secondary bonding (S).
