Desulfurizing index is defined as the amount of sulfur removed from the steel divided by the amount of sulfur that could be removed if all the synthetic slag reacted completely with the steel.

First, let's calculate the initial amount of sulfur in the steel:
0.015% of 100 metric tons = 0.015/100 x 100,000 = 15 metric tons

Next, let's calculate the final amount of sulfur in the steel:
0.0025% of 100 metric tons = 0.0025/100 x 100,000 = 2.5 metric tons
Therefore, the amount of sulfur removed from the steel is:
15 - 2.5 = 12.5 metric tons

Now, let's calculate the amount of sulfur that could be removed if all the synthetic slag reacted completely with the steel. To do this, we need to use the following equation:
Sulfur capacity of slag = 13.5 - 0.7 x (%CaO) - 0.3 x (%SiO2) - 0.4 x (%Al2O3)

Based on the composition of the synthetic slag, we can calculate its sulfur capacity as follows:
Sulfur capacity of slag = 13.5 - 0.7 x (44.6/212.6 x 100) - 0.3 x (111/212.6 x 100) - 0.4 x (57/212.6 x 100)
Sulfur capacity of slag = 12.13 kg/ton

Therefore, the total amount of sulfur that could be removed by 1250 kg of synthetic slag is:
12.13 x 125 = 1516.25 kg = 1.51625 metric tons

Finally, we can calculate the desulfurizing index:
Desulfurizing index = (amount of sulfur removed from the steel / amount of sulfur that could be removed) x 100%
Desulfurizing index = (12.5 / 1.51625) x 100%
Desulfurizing index = 824.3%
Rounding off to the nearest integer, the desulfurizing index is 824%.
