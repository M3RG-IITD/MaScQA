We will use the Gibbs-Thomson equation (or the Gibbs-Thomson relation) to solve the problem. The Gibbs-Thomson equation is given by:

∆T = (2 * γ * Tm) / (r * L)

Where:

∆T = Undercooling temperature (K)
γ = Solid/liquid interface energy ($J.m^(-2)$)
Tm = Melting point of the metal (K)
r = Radius of the critical nucleus (m)
L = Latent heat of fusion ($J.m^(-3)$)

We are given:

γ = 0.177 $J.m^(-2)$
Tm = 1356 K
L = 1.88 × $10^9$ $J.m^(-3)$
∆T = 10 K

Now we want to find r, so we rearrange the equation and solve for r:

r = (2 * γ * Tm) / (L * ∆T)

r = (2 * 0.177 * 1356) / (1.88 × $10^9$ * 10)

r = 478.632 / 18.8 × $10^9$

r ≈ 2.55 × $10^{-8}$ m

Now, we need to convert the radius from meters to nanometers, where 1 m = $10^9$ nm:

r ≈ 2.55 × $10^{-8}$ * $10^9$ nm

r ≈ 25.5 nm

So, the radius of the critical nucleus at an undercooling of 10 K is approximately 25.5 nm (rounded off to 1 decimal place). The answer should be written inside a list as:

[25.5]
