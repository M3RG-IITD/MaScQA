To answer this question, we need to understand the effects of Magnesium treatment on cast iron and its microstructure. Here is a step by step explanation:

Step 1: Understanding Cast Iron
Cast iron is a group of iron-carbon alloys with a carbon content greater than 2%. It is widely used in various applications due to its excellent castability, high wear resistance, and good machinability. The microstructure of cast iron greatly affects its mechanical properties, such as strength, ductility, and toughness. The common types of cast iron include white cast iron, gray cast iron, spheroidal graphite (ductile) cast iron, and malleable cast iron.

Step 2: White Cast Iron
White cast iron contains a high amount of carbides, which makes it hard, brittle, and wear-resistant. The name "white" refers to its bright appearance due to the absence of graphite in its microstructure. White cast iron is mainly used in applications requiring high wear resistance, such as grinding mills and railroad track components.

Step 3: Gray Cast Iron
Gray cast iron is named after its grayish appearance, which is due to the presence of graphite flakes in its microstructure. Gray cast iron has excellent castability, good wear resistance, and damping capacity. It is commonly used for engine blocks, cylinder heads, and brake discs.

Step 4: Spheroidal Graphite (Ductile) Cast Iron
Spheroidal graphite cast iron, also known as ductile cast iron or nodular cast iron, is produced by adding spheroidizing elements such as magnesium or cerium to the molten iron. These elements cause the graphite to form spherical or nodular shapes, which greatly improves the ductility, impact resistance, and fatigue strength of the cast iron. Ductile cast iron is used in automotive components, heavy machinery, and pressure vessels.

Step 5: Malleable Cast Iron
Malleable cast iron is formed by heat-treating white cast iron to transform the carbides into graphite clusters or nodules. This process improves the ductility and toughness of the cast iron, making it suitable for applications requiring strength and impact resistance, such as pipe fittings, agricultural machinery, and hand tools.

Step 6: Magnesium Treatment Effects
Magnesium treatment is carried out in the production of spheroidal graphite (ductile) cast iron. Magnesium, as well as other spheroidizing elements, is added to the molten iron to encourage the formation of graphite nodules or spheroids. This results in improved ductility and increased impact resistance compared to other forms of cast iron.

Having understood the process of magnesium treatment in cast iron production, the correct answer is:
