High cycle fatigue data for an alloy at various alternating stresses, $𝜎_a$ (see figure) is given in the figure. A specimen of this alloy is subjected to multiple stress cycles sequentially in the following order: (i) first 5000 cycles at $σ_a$ = 400 MPa followed by (ii) 25000 cycles at $σ_a$ = 300 MPa and finally (iii) at $σ_a$ = 500 MPa. Assuming that Miner’s law is obeyed, the number of cycles to failure at the final applied stress of 500 MPa is
