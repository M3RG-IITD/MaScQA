The mesh number is a measure of how many openings there are per linear inch in a sieve. To calculate it, we can use the formula:

mesh number = 1 inch / (aperture size + wire diameter)

First, we need to convert the aperture size and wire diameter to inches. There are 1,000,000 µm in 1 inch, so:

aperture size in inches = 74 µm / 1,000,000 µm/inch = 0.000074 inches
wire diameter in inches = 53 µm / 1,000,000 µm/inch = 0.000053 inches

Now we can plug these values into our formula:

mesh number = 1 / (0.000074 inches + 0.000053 inches) = 1 / 0.000127 inches

mesh number ≈ 7874.01

Rounding off to the nearest integer, we get:

mesh number ≈ 7874

So the mesh number is approximately 7874.
