To find the standard Gibbs energy of formation of $PbCl_2$(liquid) at 873 K, we'll first use the Nernst equation and then calculate the Gibbs energy using the equation: ΔG = -nFE.

The Nernst equation relates the emf of an electrochemical cell to the activities of the chemical species involved:
E = E° - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)

In the given cell, we have the following reaction:
Pb(s) + $Cl_2$(g) = $PbCl_2$(aq)

In this reaction, n = 2 (the number of electrons) and Q is the reaction quotient, which is the ratio of activities.

Q = (activity of $PbCl_2$) / (activity of Pb * activity of Cl^(-))

We know that the activity of Pb = 0.72, and the activity of $PbCl_2$ = 0.18. We need to find the activity of Cl^(-). To do this, we will use the relation between activity and partial pressure.

The partial pressure of Cl^(-) = activity of $Cl_2$ * partial pressure of $Cl_2$
Partial pressure of Cl^(-) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 atm

Now we can find Q:
Q = (activity of $PbCl_2$) / (activity of Pb * activity of Cl^(-))
Q = 0.18 / (0.72 * 0.25) = 1

Now, we can plug in the values into the Nernst equation:
E = E° - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)
1.2327 = E° - (8.314 * 873 / (2 * 96500)) * ln(1)

Since ln(1) = 0, the equation simplifies to:
E° = 1.2327 V

Now we can find the standard Gibbs energy of formation (ΔG°) using the equation:
ΔG° = -nFE°

ΔG° = -2 * 96500 * 1.2327
ΔG° = -238114.6 J/mol

Now let's convert J/mol to kJ/mol and round off to 1 decimal place:
ΔG° = -238.1 kJ/mol

The standard Gibbs energy of formation of $PbCl_2$(liquid) at 873 K is -238.1 kJ/mol.

Answer: [-238.1]
