Let x mol% of A is present in α. 
Then, in α, the composition of B = (100-x) mol%.
Also, let y mol% of A is present in β. 
Then, in β, the composition of B = (100-y) mol%.

Since the molar proportion of α to β is 2:1, we have:
moles of α/moles of β = 2/1
or, (100-x)/(100-y) = 2/1
100-x = (2/1)*(100-y)
100-x = 200 - 2y
or, y = (100-x)/2 ….. eqn. (1)

Now, overall composition of the alloy = 70 mol% B.
Thus, (2/3)*100-x + (1/3)*(100-y) = 70
Multiplying by 3 on both sides, we get:
(2*(100-x) + (100-y))/3 = 70
or, (300-2x-y)/3 = 70
or, 300 - 2x - y = 210
or, y = 90

Putting the value of y in eqn. (1), we get:
90 = (100-x)/2
or, x = 10

Therefore, the composition of α is (100-x) = 90 mol% B. 

Answer: [90]
