To answer this question, let's discuss each of the given options and evaluate their feasibility for the commercial production of titanium.

**(A) Smelting reduction of $TiO_2$:**

Smelting is a process where a metal is extracted from its ore by heating and melting it in the presence of a reducing agent. In this case, reducing $TiO_2$ to titanium would require very high temperatures (above 1600°C) to break the strong bonds in the oxide. Moreover, it is difficult to find a suitable reducing agent since titanium has a high affinity for oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon at high temperatures. Thus, smelting reduction is not a viable method for the commercial production of titanium.

**(B) Thermal dissociation of $TiH_2$:**

Thermal dissociation refers to the breaking down of a compound into its constituent elements due to heat. $TiH_2$ (titanium hydride) can be broken down by heating it, but the high temperatures required for this process make it inefficient and expensive. Furthermore, producing $TiH_2$ as an intermediate also requires a separate step involving hydrogen, making it less attractive for commercial production.

**(C) Reduction of $TiCl_4$ by Mg:**

This method, known as the Kroll process, is the most widely used method for producing titanium commercially. In this process, $TiO_2$ is first converted to $TiCl_4$ (titanium tetrachloride) by reacting with chlorine gas ($Cl_2$) in the presence of coke as a reducing agent. The $TiCl_4$ produced is then reduced by magnesium (Mg) at a temperature of about 900-1100°C, resulting in titanium formation. The reaction is as follows:

$$TiCl_4 + 2Mg → Ti + 2MgCl_2$$

The Kroll process has several advantages, including lower production temperatures, fewer impurities in the final product, and reasonable cost, making it the primary commercial method for titanium production.

**(D) Reduction of $TiO_2$ by $H_2$:**

Although it is theoretically possible to reduce $TiO_2$ with hydrogen gas ($H_2$), the reaction is not thermodynamically favorable at low temperatures, and high temperatures are necessary for the reduction to occur. This method has not been employed for commercial production due to practical difficulties, such as the requirement of high pressures and hydrogen contamination in the final product.

Now that we've discussed all the options, the correct answer is:

**[C] Reduction of $TiCl_4$ by Mg**
