First, we can assume that the heat flow is from warmer object( T= 435 K) to cooler object ( T= 400 K). Let the temperature difference between interface and top surface be $ΔT_2$ and the temperature difference between interface and bottom surface be $ΔT_1$.  



Let us calculate the heat transfer at bottom surface first. 

$ΔT_1 = T_{bottom} - T_{interface}$

$ΔT_1 = 435- ?$

As heat flow is from warmer object to cooler object, heat transfer will be calculated as $q_{bottom}$. 

$q_{bottom} = \frac{k_{material1}*A*ΔT_1}{Thickness_{material1}}$

$q_{bottom} = \frac{50*0.05^2*ΔT_1}{0.025}$      (Area is equal to Length * Width. Here Length and Width is equal to 50mm each. )

$q_{bottom} = 500ΔT_1$




Let us calculate the heat transfer at top surface now.

$ΔT_2 = T_{interface} - T_{top}$

$ΔT_2 = ?- 400$



Heat transfer at top surface will be calculated as $q_{top}$.

$q_{top} = \frac{k_{material2}*A*ΔT_2}{Thickness_{material2}}$

$q_{top} = \frac{200*0.05^2*ΔT_2}{0.025}$   (Area is equal to Length * Width. Here Length and Width is equal to 50mm each. )

$q_{top} = 4000ΔT_2$



As it is purely steady state conductive heat transfer, the total heat transfer from bottom and top should be equal. Hence, 

$q_{bottom} = q_{top}$

$500ΔT_1 = 4000ΔT_2$

$ΔT_2 = \frac{1}{8}ΔT_1$

Substituting this in above equation, 

$500ΔT_1 = 4000*\frac{1}{8}ΔT_1$

$ΔT_1 = \frac{16}{5}$


$ΔT_2 = \frac{1}{8}*\frac{16}{5} = 1$



Now, we can find out the temperature at the interface. 

$ΔT_{interface} = (T_{bottom} - T_{interface}) + (T_{interface} - T_{top})$

$ΔT_{interface} = ΔT_1 + ΔT_2$

$ΔT_{interface} = \frac{16}{5} + 1 = \frac{21}{5}$


Hence, the temperature at the interface is (435 - $\frac{21}{5}$) K ≈ 413 K (rounded off to nearest integer)
