First, we need to understand the different types of magnetism and how they relate to the atomic dipole moments shown in the figures:

- Diamagnetism: In diamagnetic materials, all the atomic dipole moments cancel each other out, resulting in no net magnetic moment. When a magnetic field is applied, the material is weakly repelled by it. This is because the magnetic field induces a magnetic moment in the opposite direction to the applied field, leading to a net magnetic moment that opposes the applied field.
- Paramagnetism: In paramagnetic materials, the atomic dipole moments do not cancel each other out, leading to a net magnetic moment even in the absence of an external magnetic field. When a magnetic field is applied, the material is weakly attracted to it, as the magnetic moments align with the field direction.
- Ferromagnetism: In ferromagnetic materials, there is a spontaneous alignment of atomic dipole moments, even in the absence of an external magnetic field. This results in a large net magnetic moment, which can be further increased by the application of an external magnetic field. Ferromagnetic materials retain their magnetism even after the external field is removed.
- Antiferromagnetism: In antiferromagnetic materials, the atomic dipole moments of neighboring atoms align in opposite directions, resulting in cancellation of their net magnetic moment. However, there is a long-range order in the alignment of dipole moments, leading to unique magnetic properties.

Now, we can analyze each figure and map them to the correct type of magnetism:

- Figure P shows atomic dipole moments in random directions, leading to cancelation of net magnetic moment. This corresponds to diamagnetism.
- Figure Q shows atomic dipole moments aligned in pairs with opposite directions. While neighboring pairs cancel each other out, there is still a net magnetic moment due to misalignment among pairs. This corresponds to antiferromagnetism.
- Figure R shows atomic dipole moments in random directions, but the magnitudes of dipole moments are not equal. This leads to a small net magnetic moment, even in the absence of an external magnetic field. This corresponds to paramagnetism.
- Figure S shows atomic dipole moments aligned in the same direction, resulting in a large net magnetic moment. This corresponds to ferromagnetism.

Thus, the correct mapping of magnetism to atomic dipole moments is:

(B) P – Ferromagnetism, Q - Antiferromagnetism, R – Diamagnetism, S - Paramagnetism.
