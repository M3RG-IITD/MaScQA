We can break down the problem into several parts: pressure distribution, velocity distribution and streamlines.

**Pressure Distribution:**

For steady incompressible inviscid flow, Bernoulli's principle states: 

$P+\frac{1}{2}\rho v^2=$ Constant

where $P$ is the pressure, $\rho$ is the density of fluid, $v$ is the velocity.

Along streamline OA, the pressure is same at point O and A because velocity is same and height is same. Therefore, options A and B are false.

**Velocity Distribution:**

Consider the velocity distribution at point A. By reductio ad absurdum, let's assume the velocity at point A is not zero. Then, there will be a component of velocity tangential to the surface of the sphere which does not make sense because the sphere is smooth and non-rotating. Therefore, the velocity at point A is zero. Option C is true.

**Streamlines:**

Streamlines are lines drawn such that the tangent at any point gives the direction of the velocity vector at that point. 

Fluid moving along streamline OA will not deflect because the flow is symmetrical. Therefore, option D is false.

Hence, the correct option(s) is(are):
- (C) Fluid moving precisely along OA will turn perpendicular to OA to circumvent the object
