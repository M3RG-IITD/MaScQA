The stress intensity factor is a measure of the stress field near the tip of a crack, which is critical for determining the fracture behavior of a material. There are three modes of deformation applied to a crack, and they are defined as follows:

1. Mode I: Crack opening mode - This mode involves the opening of the crack faces perpendicular to the direction of crack growth. The stress applied in this mode is tensile stress, and it acts normal to the plane of the crack.

2. Mode II: Forward shear mode - In this mode, the crack faces slide against each other in the direction of crack growth. The stress applied in this mode is shear stress, and it acts parallel to both the plane of the crack and the direction of crack growth.

3. Mode III: Parallel shear mode - This mode is also characterized by the sliding of crack faces against each other. However, the stress applied in this mode is shear stress that acts parallel to the plane of the crack but perpendicular to the direction of crack growth.

Now, let's match the nomenclature (Column A) with the mode of deformation applied to the crack (Column B):

(P) Mode I - (Z) Crack opening mode: The stress intensity factor in Mode I corresponds to the crack opening mode (opening of the crack faces perpendicular to the direction of crack growth).

(Q) Mode II - (X) Forward shear mode: The stress intensity factor in Mode II corresponds to the forward shear mode (sliding of crack faces in the direction of crack growth).

(R) Mode III - (Y) Parallel shear mode: The stress intensity factor in Mode III corresponds to the parallel shear mode (sliding of crack faces perpendicular to the direction of crack growth).

So, the correct option is:

(A) P - Z, Q - Y, R - X
