First, we need to find the equilibrium constant (K) for the reaction CO(g) + 0.5$O_2$(g)⇔ $CO_2$(g) at 1873 K using the equation:

$Δ_(r)G°$ = -RTlnK

where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and ln is the natural logarithm.

$Δ_(r)G°_(1873)$ = -120860 J
R = 8.314 J.$K^(-1).mol^(-1)$
T = 1873 K

-120860 = -8.314 x 1873 x lnK
lnK = 24.7
K = e^(24.7) = 4.46 x 10^(10)

Next, we need to calculate the value of $Δ_(r)G$ for the reaction Mo(s) + $O_2$(g) ⇔ $MoO_2$(s) at 1873 K using the equation:

$Δ_(r)G$ = $Δ_(r)G°$ + RTln(Q)

where Q is the reaction quotient.

For the given reaction, Q = $p_(O_2)$/$a_(Mo)$, as the stoichiometric coefficients are both 1.

$Δ_(r)G$ = 0 + 8.314 x 1873 x ln($p_(O_2)$/$a_(Mo)$)

We can simplify this equation by using $pO_(2)$/$a_(Mo)$ = $p_(O_2)$/$0.5a_(MoO_(2))$, as the two reactants have 1:1 stoichiometry in the product.

$Δ_(r)G$ = 8.314 x 1873 x ln($p_(O_2)$/$0.5a_(MoO_(2))$)

Now we can use the equation for the Gibbs free energy change ($Δ_(f)G$) of formation of $MoO_2$(s) to calculate the value of $Δ_(f)G$ for $MoO_2$(s) at 1873 K:

$Δ_(f)G$ = $Δ_(f)G°$ + RTln($a_(MoO_(2))$)

$Δ_(f)G$ = 0 + 8.314 x 1873 x ln(0.5)

We can now use the relationship $Δ_(r)G$ = $Δ_(f)G$($MoO_(2)$) - $ΣΔ_(f)G$(reactants) to find $Δ_(r)G$:

$Δ_(r)G$ = $Δ_(f)G$($MoO_(2)$) - $Δ_(f)G$($Mo(s)$) - 0.5$Δ_(f)G$($O_2$(g))

$Δ_(r)G$ = (8.314 x 1873 x ln(0.5)) - 0 - 0.5(0)

$Δ_(r)G$ = 7.8 x 10^(3) J

Finally, we can use the equation:

$Δ_(r)G$ = -RTln($K_(p)$)

to solve for the equilibrium partial pressures of CO and $CO_2$:

$K_(p)$ = e^(-$Δ_(r)G$/(RT))

$K_(p)$ = e^(-7800/(8.314 x 1873))

$K_(p)$ = 0.0256

$p_(CO_2)$/$p_(CO)$ = $K_(p)$/$p°$

where $p°$ is the standard pressure of 1 bar.

$p_(CO_2)$/$p_(CO)$ = 0.0256/1

$p_(CO_2)$/$p_(CO)$ = 0.0256

Therefore, the equilibrium $p_(CO)$/$p_(CO_2)$ ratio for the given reaction at 1873 K is 0.03 (rounded off to 2 decimal places). Answer: [0.03].
