To calculate the desulfurizing index, we first need to determine how much sulfur is removed from the steel.

1. Calculate the initial sulfur mass in the steel:
Initial sulfur mass = (Initial sulfur content x Steel mass) / 100
Initial sulfur mass = (0.015 x 100,000 kg) / 100
Initial sulfur mass = 15 kg

2. Calculate the final sulfur mass in the steel:
Final sulfur mass = (Final sulfur content x Steel mass) / 100
Final sulfur mass = (0.0025 x 100,000 kg) / 100
Final sulfur mass = 2.5 kg

3. Calculate the mass of sulfur removed from the steel:
Sulfur removed = Initial sulfur mass - Final sulfur mass
Sulfur removed = 15 kg - 2.5 kg
Sulfur removed = 12.5 kg

4. Calculate the desulfurizing index:
Desulfurizing index = (Mass of sulfur removed / Mass of synthetic slag) x 100
Desulfurizing index = (12.5 kg / 1250 kg) x 100
Desulfurizing index = 1 %

The desulfurizing index is approximately 1. So, the answer is [1].
