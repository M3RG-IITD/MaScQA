We are given that the partial molar enthalpy of Au (HAu_P) in Au-Ag melt is -8300 J/mol, and the temperature (T) is 1400 K. We are also given the gas constant (R) as 8.314 J/mol·K. We know the mole fraction of Au (xAu) is 25 mol%, i.e., 0.25.

For regular solution behavior, we can use the formula relating the activity (aAu) with the mole fraction and partial molar enthalpy:

activity coefficient (γAu) = exp (HAu_P / (R * T))

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get:

ln(γAu) = HAu_P / (R * T)

We can now substitute the values given in the question:

ln(γAu) = -8300 / (8.314 * 1400)

ln(γAu) ≈ -0.709

Now, we can find the activity coefficient (γAu) by finding the exponent of ln(γAu):

γAu = exp(-0.709) ≈ 0.492

Using the definition of activity, we have:

aAu = xAu * γAu

aAu = 0.25 * 0.492

aAu ≈ 0.123

Therefore, the activity of Au in the melt is approximately 0.123. So, the answer is [0.123].
