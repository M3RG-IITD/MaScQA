To calculate the pressure inside the gas bubble, we'll use the Young-Laplace equation:

ΔP = 2 * T / R

where:
- ΔP is the pressure difference between the inside and outside of the bubble
- T is the surface tension of the molten steel (1.4 N⋅m⁻¹)
- R is the radius of the bubble (0.01 mm = 1 * 10⁻⁵ m)

First, let's calculate the pressure difference:

ΔP = 2 * T / R
ΔP = 2 * 1.4 N⋅m⁻¹ / (1 * 10⁻⁵ m)
ΔP = 2.8 * 10⁵ Pa

Now, to find the pressure inside the bubble, we need to add this pressure difference to the pressure outside the bubble. Given that 1 bar = 10⁵ Pa, the pressure outside the bubble is:

1.5 bar * 10⁵ Pa/bar = 1.5 * 10⁵ Pa

Adding both pressures:

Pressure inside = Pressure outside + ΔP
Pressure inside = 1.5 * 10⁵ Pa + 2.8 * 10⁵ Pa
Pressure inside = 4.3 * 10⁵ Pa

Now, we convert the pressure back to bar:

Pressure inside (bar) = Pressure inside (Pa) / (10⁵ Pa/bar)
Pressure inside (bar) = (4.3 * 10⁵ Pa) / (10⁵ Pa/bar)
Pressure inside (bar) = 4.3 bar

The pressure inside the bubble is 4.3 bar, rounded off to one decimal place. So, the answer is [4.3].
