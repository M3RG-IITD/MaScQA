The misorientation angle of 2° tells us that the crystal orientations on either side of the tilt boundary are misaligned by 2° with respect to each other. 

To determine the spacing between the dislocations that form the tilt boundary, we can use the following equation:

d = a / sin(θ/2)

where d is the spacing between the dislocations, a is the lattice parameter, and θ is the misorientation angle. 

Plugging in the given values, we get:

d = 0.143 nm / sin(2°/2)
d = 0.143 nm / sin(1°)
d = 0.143 nm / 0.017452
d = 8.18 nm (rounded off to 2 decimal places)

Therefore, the spacing between the dislocations that form the tilt boundary is 8.18 nm. 

Answer: [8.18]
