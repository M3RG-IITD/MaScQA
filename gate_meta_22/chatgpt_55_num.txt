We can use the following formula to calculate the radius of critical nucleus:

$r = \frac{2\gamma_{sl}}{L_f\Delta T}$

Where,
$\gamma_{sl}$ = solid/liquid interface energy
$L_f$ = latent heat of fusion
$\Delta T$ = undercooling

Substituting the given values, we get:

$r = \frac{2 \times 0.177}{1.88 \times 10^9 \times 10}$

$r = 9.4 \times 10^{-9} m$

Converting meters to nanometers, we get:

$r = 9.4 \times 10^{-3} nm$

Rounding off to 1 decimal place, we get:

$r = 0.0$ nm (Answer)

Therefore, the radius of the critical nucleus at an undercooling of 10 K is approximately 0.0 nm. This indicates that it is practically impossible for homogeneous nucleation to occur under these conditions.
