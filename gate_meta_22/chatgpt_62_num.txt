We can use the formula for convective heat transfer rate :    

$q = hA(T_w - T_\infty)$

where, 

$q$ = heat transfer rate in Watts(W)
 
$h$ = convective heat transfer coefficient in \[W.m^(-2).K^(-1)\]

$A$ = surface area for heat transfer in $m^2$

$T_w$ = temperature of the inner wall of the tube in K

$T_\infty$ = temperature of the air in K

For the given problem, we can find $A$ as follows:

Area($A$) = $\pi dL$

where,

$d$ = inner diameter of the tube

$L$ = length of the tube

Given $d = 0.08 m$

We have to find the length ($L$) of the tube.

$q = hA(T_w - T_\infty)$

$\implies q = h\pi d L(T_w - T_\infty)$

We can find $q$ as follows:

mass flow rate($\dot{m}$) = 1.5 $kg.s^(-1)$

specific heat capacity of air($c_p$) = 1080 $J.kg^(-1).K^(-1)$

$\Delta T = \vert T_w - T_\infty \vert$ = $700 - 600$ = 100 K

From the conservation of energy, 

$q = \dot{m}c_p\Delta T$

$\implies q = 1.5\times 1080 \times 100$

$\implies q = 162000 J.s^(-1)$

Now, substituting all the known values back in the equation for $q$: 

$q = h\pi d L(T_w - T_\infty)$

we can solve for $L$ as follows:

$L = \frac{q}{h\pi d (T_w - T_\infty)}$

Substituting the respective numerical values we get,

$L = \frac{162000}{500 \times \pi \times 0.08 \times 100}$

$L \approx$ 8.16 m

Therefore, the length of the tube is 8.16 metres.
