(P) Cottrell atmosphere: Segregation of solutes to the stacking fault.

(Q) Suzuki interaction: Stress assisted diffusion of vacancies resulting in plastic deformation in a polycrystalline material.

(R) Bauschinger effect: Decrease in yield stress when loading direction is reversed.

(S) Nabarro-Herring creep: LÃ¼ders bands.

Therefore, the matching option is:

(B) P - 1, Q - 2, R - 4, S - 3
