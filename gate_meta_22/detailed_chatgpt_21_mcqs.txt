A lap joint is a joint between two overlapping members. A fillet weld is a weld that has a triangular cross-section and is used in the corner formed by two members. The fillet weld can be placed on one or both sides of the joint.

To identify the lap joint with fillet weld in the given figures, we need to look for the overlapping members and the fillet weld at the joint.

- Figure I shows a butt joint, where the two members are joined end to end. There is no overlap and no fillet weld.
- Figure II shows a lap joint with a plug weld, where a hole is drilled or punched in the top member, and the bottom member is welded to this hole using a weld. There is no fillet weld.
- Figure III shows a lap joint with a corner fillet weld. This is the correct answer because it shows the overlapping members and the fillet weld in the corner of the joint.
- Figure IV shows a T-joint with a fillet weld, where one member is joined to the top of the other member. This is not a lap joint, so it is not the correct answer.

Therefore, the correct figure that illustrates a lap joint with fillet weld is (C) III.
