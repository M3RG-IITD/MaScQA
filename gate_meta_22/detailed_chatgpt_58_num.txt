The mesh number of a sieve indicates the number of openings per linear inch. 
To find the mesh number of the given sieve we need to find the number of openings per linear inch. 

First, we need to convert the wire diameter and aperture size to inches:
- Wire diameter = 53 µm = 53 × 10^-6 m = 0.0021 inches
- Aperture size = 74 µm = 74 × 10^-6 m = 0.0029 inches

The distance between two adjacent wires in the sieve is the sum of the wire diameter and the aperture size:
0.0021 + 0.0029 = 0.005 inches

To find the number of openings per linear inch, we need to find the reciprocal of the distance between two adjacent wires:
1 / 0.005 = 200

Therefore, the mesh number of the sieve is 200. 

Answer: 
- 200
