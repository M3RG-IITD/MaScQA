Sieverts' Law states that the solubility of a gas in a liquid is proportional to the partial pressure of the gas over the liquid. Mathematically, we can represent this relationship as:

$S = K * P$

Where:
$S$ is the solubility of the gas in the liquid
$K$ is the proportionality constant (also called Sieverts' constant)
$P$ is the partial pressure of the gas

In this case, we are given the equilibrium partial pressure of $N_2$ (gas) as $𝑝_(N_2)$. According to Sieverts' law, the equilibrium solubility of $N_2$ (gas) in molten steel is proportional to the partial pressure of $N_2$ (gas). So, we can write the relationship as:

$S_(N_2) = K * 𝑝_(N_2)$

Therefore, the equilibrium solubility of $N_2$ (gas) in molten steel is proportional to (A) $𝑝_(N_2)$.

Answer: [A].
