Heat input is given by the formula: Heat input = Arc voltage × Welding current × Arc heat transfer efficiency ÷ Welding speed

Since both welds have identical heat input, we can write:

Heat input 1 = Heat input 2

We are given the following for weld 1:

Arc voltage 1 = 18 V
Welding current 1 = 200 A
Arc heat transfer efficiency 1 = 0.65
Welding speed 1 = 0.002 $m.s^(-1)$

For weld 2:

Arc voltage 2 = 18 V (same as weld 1)
Arc heat transfer efficiency 2 = 0.65 (same as weld 1)
Welding speed 2 = 0.0022 $m.s^(-1)$
Welding current 2 = x (unknown, this is what we want to find)

Now we can plug these values into the heat input equation:

(18 × 200 × 0.65 ÷ 0.002) = (18 × x × 0.65 ÷ 0.0022)

Solving for x (welding current 2):

x = (200 × 0.65 ÷ 0.002) × (0.0022 ÷ 0.65)

x ≈ 214.3 A

Rounding off to the nearest integer gives a welding current of approximately 214 A for the second weld.

Answer: [214]
