We are given the flow stress at two different strain rates and asked to find the strain rate sensitivity parameter (m) of the alloy. 

Let's first understand what the strain rate sensitivity parameter is. It is a measure of an alloy's capacity to resist deformation due to changes in the applied strain rate. The higher the strain rate sensitivity, the more capable the alloy is at accommodating strain rate variations.

The flow stress σ can be related to the strain rate (ε') and the strain rate sensitivity m using the following equation:

σ = σ₀(ε')^(m)

Where σ is the flow stress, σ₀ is a reference stress, ε' is the strain rate, and m is the strain rate sensitivity parameter.

We are given the flow stress and strain rate for two different cases:

1. σ₁ = 50 MPa, ε'₁ = 0.1 s^(-1)
2. σ₂ = 70 MPa, ε'₂ = 10 s^(-1)

We can write the equation for each case:

1. 50 = σ₀(0.1)^m
2. 70 = σ₀(10)^m

Now, we'll solve these equations for m.

First, divide equation (2) by equation (1):

(70/50) = (10/0.1)^m
1.4 = 100^m

Now, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(1.4) = m * ln(100)

To find the value of m, we'll simply divide both sides by ln(100):

m = ln(1.4) / ln(100)

Now, we'll plug in the values and round off to 3 decimal places:

m ≈ 0.118 / 4.605 ≈ 0.025

So, the strain rate sensitivity parameter is approximately 0.025. The answer should be written in a list as follows:

[0.025]
