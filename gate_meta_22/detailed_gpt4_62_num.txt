Given data:

Coefficient of convective heat transfer (h) = 500 W/m².K
Specific heat capacity of air (Cp) = 1080 J/kg.K
Mass flow rate of air (m) = 1.5 kg/s
Inner diameter of the tube (d) = 0.08 m
Inner wall temperature of the tube (Tw) = 700 K
Temperature of the air leaving the tube (T_exit) = 600 K
Temperature of the air entering the tube (T_entry) = 300 K

We need to find the length of the tube (L).

First, we will find the temperature difference between the air and the tube wall.

ΔT = Tw - T_exit
ΔT = 700 - 600
ΔT = 100 K

Now, we will find the heat transfer rate (Q) between the tube wall and the air using the convection heat transfer formula:

Q = h * A * ΔT

Here, A is the surface area of the tube, which can be represented as:

A = π * d * L

Now, we will equate the heat transfer rate (Q) to the energy gained by the air as it flows through the tube. The energy gained by the air can be calculated using the mass flow rate (m), specific heat capacity (Cp), and temperature difference between entry and exit (ΔT_air):

Q = m * Cp * ΔT_air

ΔT_air = T_exit - T_entry
ΔT_air = 600 - 300
ΔT_air = 300 K

Therefore, the heat transfer rate (Q) can be calculated as:

Q = 1.5 * 1080 * 300
Q = 486000 W

Now, we can substitute the values of h, A, and ΔT in the heat transfer equation:

486000 = 500 * π * 0.08 * L * 100

Dividing both sides by 500, π, 0.08, and 100, we get:

L = 486000 / (500 * 3.14 * 0.08 * 100)
L ≈ 12.32035928 m

Rounding off to 2 decimal places, the length of the tube (L) is approximately:

L ≈ 12.32 m

Thus, the length of the tube is approximately 12.32 m.

Answer: [12.32]
