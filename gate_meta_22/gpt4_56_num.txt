To find the magnitude of the flux, we need to use Fick's first law of diffusion, which states:

Flux = -D * dC/dx

where D is the diffusion coefficient and dC/dx is the derivative of the concentration with respect to x.

In this case, the concentration, C = a_1 * x^2 + a_2 * x, and both a_1 and a_2 are given as 1 (in $atoms.mm^(-5)$ and $atoms.mm^(-4)$, respectively). So,

C = 1 * x^2 + 1 * x

Next, we need to find the derivative of C with respect to x:

dC/dx = 2 * x + 1

Now we can find the magnitude of the flux at x = 2 mm:

Flux = -D * dC/dx = -3 * 10^(-3) * (2 * 2 + 1)

Flux = -3 * 10^(-3) * (4 + 1)

Flux = -3 * 10^(-3) * 5

Flux = -15 * 10^(-3) atoms.mm^(-2)*s^(-1)

The magnitude of the flux at x = 2 mm is 15 * 10^(-3) atoms.mm^(-2)*s^(-1). So, the value of y is 15.

The correct answer is [15].
