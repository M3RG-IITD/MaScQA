Given data:

The coefficient of convective heat transfer from tube wall to air, h = 500 $W.m^(-2).K^(-1)$

Specific heat capacity of air, $c_p$ = 1080 $J.kg^(-1).K^(-1)$

Ï€ = 3.14

Mass flow rate of air, $\dot{m}$ = 1.5 $kg.s^(-1)$

Inner diameter of metallic tube, d = 0.08 m

Inner wall temperature of the tube, $T_{wi}$ = 700 K

Temperature of the air leaving the tube, $T_{wo}$ = 600 K


Assumptions:

1. Steady-state heat transfer occurs by convection only.

2. The properties of air are constant.


We need to find the length of the tube, L(in metres).

We can use the heat balance equation for the tube:

$\dot{m}c_p(T_{wo}-T_{wi}) = \pi d L h(T_{wi}-T_{infinity})$

where, 

$\pi d L $= surface area of the tube

$T_{infinity}$ = Temperature of air surroundings

From the given data, we know that the air is being passed through the tube, so we can assume that air surroundings temperature can be taken as 300K as given.

Rearranging the above equation, we get:

$L = \frac{\dot{m} c_p (T_{wo}-T_{wi})}{\pi d h (T_{wi}-T_{\infty})}$

Substituting the given values, we get:

$L = \frac{(1.5)(1080)(600-700)}{(3.14)(0.08)(500)(700-300)}$

$L = 1.34 m$

Therefore, the length of the tube is 1.34 metres.

Answer: 

The length of the tube is 1.34 metres (rounded off to 2 decimal places).
