To find the correct statement(s) about the role of nickel as an alloying element in steels, let's discuss each statement in detail:

(A) It increases the $M_s$ temperature:

The $M_s$ temperature, or martensite start temperature, is the temperature at which a steel alloy undergoes a phase change from austenite to martensite. Nickel does not increase the $M_s$ temperature. Instead, it reduces the $M_s$ temperature and helps in retaining more austenite, which later helps in reducing the brittleness of the steel. So, the statement (A) is incorrect.

(B) It is an austenite stabiliser:

Yes, nickel is an austenite stabilizer. Austenite is a face-centered cubic (fcc) structure, which is stable at high temperature. Nickel, being an fcc element, promotes the stability of the austenite phase at lower temperatures, resulting in better toughness and impact strength of steels. So, the statement (B) is correct.

(C) It decreases the $M_s$ temperature:

As mentioned earlier, nickel actually decreases the $M_s$ temperature, which helps in retaining more austenite and reducing the brittleness of the steel. So, the statement (C) is correct.

(D) It is a carbide former:

Carbide formers are elements that bond with carbon in steel to form carbides. Generally, carbide formers include elements like chromium, vanadium, tungsten, and molybdenum. Nickel does not have the tendency to form carbides with carbon atoms in steel. Instead, it mostly exists in solution in the ferrite and austenite phases. So, the statement (D) is incorrect.

Hence, the correct statements are B and C.

The answer is [B, C].
