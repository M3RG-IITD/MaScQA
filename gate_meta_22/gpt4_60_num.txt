We are given the initial diameter (D1) and final diameter (D2) of the cylindrical specimen, and we need to find the ideal plastic work per unit volume. For this, we will use the flow behavior equation provided, 𝜎 = 350 * 𝜖^0.3.

First, let's find the true strain (𝜖). The volume of the specimen remains constant during deformation, so we can say:

π * (D1^2) * h1 = π * (D2^2) * h2

Since we are interested in the strain, we can just use the ratio of the cross-sectional areas (A1 = π * (D1^2)/4) and (A2 = π * (D2^2)/4):

A1 / A2 = (D1^2) / (D2^2)

True strain 𝜖 = ln(A1/A2)
                 = ln((D1^2) / (D2^2))
                 = ln(D1/D2)^2
                 = 2 * ln(D1/D2)

Now, let's plug in the diameters values:

𝜖 = 2 * ln(30/20)
    ≈ 2 * ln(1.5)
    ≈ 0.8109

Now, let's find the stress (𝜎) for this strain:

𝜎 = 350 * 𝜖^0.3
    = 350 * (0.8109^0.3)
    ≈ 311.1 MPa

Now, the ideal plastic work per unit volume is given by integrating the stress-strain curve with respect to the strain, which can be written as:

W = ∫(0,𝜖) (350 * 𝜖^0.3) d𝜖

We can use the power rule for integration:

W = (350 * (𝜖^(0.3+1)) / (0.3+1)) | from 𝜖 = 0 to 0.8109

Now, let's solve for W:

W = (350 * (0.8109^1.3)) / (1.3)
    ≈ 172.35 J/m^3

Given that our answer must be in mega joules:

W = 172.35 * 10^(-6) MJ/m^3
    ≈ 0.00017235 MJ/m^3

Rounding off to the nearest integer, the ideal plastic work of deformation per unit volume is 0 MJ/m^3.

So the answer is [0].
