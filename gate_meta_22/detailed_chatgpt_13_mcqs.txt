The correct answer is (A) smelting reduction of $TiO_2$.

Let's go through each option and eliminate the incorrect ones:

(A) Smelting reduction of $TiO_2$: This process is used commercially to produce titanium. It involves heating $TiO_2$ with carbon in a furnace at high temperatures. The carbon reduces the $TiO_2$ to titanium metal, which can then be purified and processed further.

(B) Thermal dissociation of $TiH_2$: This process involves heating $TiH_2$ to high temperatures to break it down into titanium metal and hydrogen gas. While this process can be used to produce small amounts of titanium for research or specialty applications, it is not a practical way to produce titanium on a commercial scale.

(C) Reduction of $TiCl_4$ by Mg: This process does occur in the production of titanium, but it is not the primary method. $TiCl_4$ is reacted with magnesium metal to yield solid titanium and magnesium chloride. However, the process requires careful control of the reaction conditions and is typically used to produce small quantities of titanium.

(D) Reduction of $TiO_2$ by $H_2$: While it is possible to use hydrogen gas to reduce $TiO_2$ to titanium metal, this process is not used commercially. It is more commonly used in laboratory settings to produce small quantities of titanium for research purposes.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) smelting reduction of $TiO_2$.
