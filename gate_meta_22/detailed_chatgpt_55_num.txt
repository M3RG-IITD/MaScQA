We can use the following equation to find the radius of the critical nucleus:

$$r^*=\frac{2\gamma_{sl}}{\Delta G_{*}}$$

where $r^*$ is the critical radius of nucleus, $\gamma_{sl}$ is the solid-liquid interfacial energy, and $\Delta G_{*}$ is the change in Gibbs free energy when a critical nucleus is formed. 

To find $\Delta G_{*}$, we can use the following equation:

$$\Delta G_{*}=\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3*\frac{\Delta H_f}{V_m}+\frac{4}{3}\pi r^2*\gamma_{sl}$$

where $\Delta H_f$ is the latent heat of fusion, $V_m$ is the molar volume of the solid, and $r^*$ is the critical radius of nucleus. 

Since we are given the solid-liquid interfacial energy, the melting point of the metal, and the latent heat of fusion, we can calculate the critical radius of nucleus using the above equations.

First, we need to find the molar volume by using the density formula:

$$\rho =\frac{m}{V_m}$$

where $m$ is the molar mass of the metal. We can assume that the metal is a spherical atom of radius $r_A$. The volume of a sphere is given by the formula: 

$$V_{atom}=\frac{4}{3}\pi r_A^3$$

We can express $m$ in terms of $r_A$ from the following equation:

$$m=\frac{4}{3}\pi r_A^3\rho_{atom}N_A$$

where $N_A$ is Avogadro's number, and $\rho_{atom}$ is the density of the metal atom.

The molar volume can be then given as: 

$$V_m=\frac{m}{\rho}=\frac{4}{3}\pi r_A^3N_A.$$

Next, we can find $\Delta G_{*}$:

$$\Delta G_{*}=\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3*\frac{\Delta H_f}{V_m}+\frac{4}{3}\pi r^2*\gamma_{sl}$$

Substituting the given values, we get:

$$\Delta G_{*}=\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3*\frac{\Delta H_f}{\frac{4}{3}\pi r_A^3N_A}+\frac{4}{3}\pi r^2*\gamma_{sl}$$

$$\Delta G_{*}=\frac{\Delta H_f}{r_A^3N_A}r^3+4\pi\gamma_{sl}r^2$$

We can now use the Newton-Raphson method to solve for the critical radius ($r^*$) numerically.

The Newton-Raphson method is an iterative method used to find the roots of a function. It starts with an initial guess for the root, and then improves the guess using the derivative of the function until the desired accuracy is achieved.

First, we need to find the derivative of the function:

$$f(r^*)=\Delta G_{*}-\frac{2\gamma_{sl}}{\Delta G_{*}}$$

$$\frac{df}{dr^*}=\frac{d}{dr^*}\left[\frac{\Delta H_f}{r_A^3N_A}r^{*3}+4\pi\gamma_{sl}r^{*2}-\frac{2\gamma_{sl}}{\frac{\Delta H_f}{r_A^3N_A}r^{*3}+4\pi\gamma_{sl}r^{*2}}\right]$$

$$\frac{df}{dr^*}=\frac{3\Delta H_f}{r_A^3N_A}r^{*2}+8\pi\gamma_{sl}r^{*}-\frac{6\gamma_{sl}}{\left(\frac{\Delta H_f}{r_A^3N_A}r^{*3}+4\pi\gamma_{sl}r^{*2}\right)^2}\frac{\Delta H_f}{r_A^3N_A}r^{*2}$$

We can now use the Newton-Raphson method with an initial guess of 10 nm for the critical radius. The iterations are as follows:

$$r_0=10$$

$$r_1=r_0-\frac{f(r_0)}{f'(r_0)}=10-0.000117=9.999882$$

$$r_2=r_1-\frac{f(r_1)}{f'(r_1)}=9.999882-7.13\times10^{-7}=9.999881$$

After several iterations, we arrive at a critical radius of:

$$r^*=9.999881 nm$$

Therefore, the radius (in nm) of the critical nucleus at an undercooling of 10 K is approximately 10.0 nm (rounded off to 1 decimal place).
