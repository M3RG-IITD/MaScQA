The correct answer is (B) P - 1, Q - 2, R - 4, S - 3.

Explanation:
- Cottrell atmosphere (P) is related to the segregation of solutes to the stacking fault (4).
- Suzuki interaction (Q) is related to stress assisted diffusion of vacancies resulting in plastic deformation in a polycrystalline material (2).
- Bauschinger effect (R) refers to the decrease in yield stress when loading direction is reversed (1).
- Nabarro-Herring creep (S) is related to LÃ¼ders bands (3).
