To find the activity of Au in the Ag-Au melt, we need to use the following equation for regular solution behavior:

$$a_{Au} = \exp \left( \frac{H_{Au}^E - T \frac{dH_{Au}^E}{dT}}{RT} \right)X_{Au} $$

Where:
- $a_{Au}$ is the activity of Au in the melt
- $H_{Au}^E$ is the partial molar enthalpy of Au (-8300 J/mol)
- $T$ is the temperature (1400 K)
- $R$ is the gas constant (8.314 J.K^(-1).mol^(-1))
- $X_{Au}$ is the mol fraction of Au in the melt (0.25)

We need to evaluate the term $\frac{dH_{Au}^E}{dT}$, which represents the derivative of the partial molar enthalpy of Au with respect to temperature. Since we're not given any information about the temperature dependence of the partial molar enthalpy, we can assume that it's constant with respect to temperature. This means that the derivative term is zero:

$$ \frac{dH_{Au}^E}{dT} = 0 $$

Now we can plug the values into the equation to find the activity of Au:

$$a_{Au} = \exp \left( \frac{-8300 - 1400 * 0}{(8.314)(1400)} \right) * 0.25$$

$$a_{Au} = \exp \left( \frac{-8300}{(8.314)(1400)} \right) * 0.25$$
