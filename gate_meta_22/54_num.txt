(Given: The two parts of the block made of Material I and Material II have equal thickness of 25 mm each. The thermal conductivities of Material I and Material II are 50 $W.m^(-1).K(-1)$ and 200 $W.m^(-1).K(-1)$ , respectively.)  A rectangular block made of Material I and Material II of identical cross sections (as shown in the figure) has a temperature (T) of 435 K and 400 K at the bottom and top surfaces, respectively. Assuming purely steady state conductive heat transfer, the temperature(in kelvin) at the interface is? (round off to nearest integer).
