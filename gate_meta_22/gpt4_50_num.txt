To find the spacing between the dislocations in the tilt boundary, we can use the following formula:

Spacing = (lattice parameter * sin(misorientation angle))/(π * Burgers vector)

Here, the lattice parameter of aluminium is 0.143 nm, and the misorientation angle = 2°. For an aluminium grain, the Burgers vector is a/2<110> i.e. 1/2 of the lattice parameter.

Given, the lattice parameter of aluminium = 0.143 nm
Burgers vector = 0.143 nm * 1/2 = 0.0715 nm

Let's proceed:

Spacing = (0.143 nm * sin(2°))/(π * 0.0715 nm)

Convert the angle from degrees to radians:

1° = π/180 radians
2° = 2 * π/180 = π/90 radians

Spacing = (0.143 nm * sin(π/90))/(π * 0.0715)

Using a calculator, we get:

Spacing ≈ 0.04974 nm

Rounded off to 2 decimal places, the spacing between the dislocations that form the tilt boundary is 0.05 nm.

The correct answer is [0.05].
