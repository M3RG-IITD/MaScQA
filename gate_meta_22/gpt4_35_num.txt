We can use Newton's law of viscosity to find the viscosity of the liquid. Newton's law of viscosity states that the shear stress acting on a fluid is proportional to the rate of strain, which is the velocity gradient in this case. Mathematically, it can be represented as:

$$\tau = \mu (\dfrac{dv}{dy})$$

where
- $\tau$ is the shear stress acting on the fluid (given as 5 Pa),
- $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid (which we need to find),
- $dv$ is the change in velocity between the plates (given as 2 m/s), and
- $dy$ is the distance between the plates (given as $10^{-3}$ m).

We are given $\tau$, $dv$, and $dy$, so we can rearrange the equation to solve for $\mu$:

$$\mu = \dfrac{\tau}{(\dfrac{dv}{dy})}$$

Now we can plug in the given values and solve for $\mu$:

$$\mu = \dfrac{5 \,\text{Pa}}{\dfrac{2\, \text{m/s}}{10^{-3}\, \text{m}}}$$

$$\mu = 5 \,\text{Pa} * \dfrac{10^{-3}\, \text{m}}{2\, \text{m/s}}$$

$$\mu = 2.5 * 10^{-3}\, \text{Pa}\cdot\text{s}$$

So, the viscosity of the liquid is $2.5 * 10^{-3}$ Pa.s. Now we can compare this value to the given form y * $10^{-3}$ Pa.s:

$$2.5 * 10^{-3}\, \text{Pa}\cdot\text{s} = y * 10^{-3}\, \text{Pa}\cdot\text{s}$$

To find y, simply divide both sides by $10^{-3}$ Pa.s:

$$y = 2.5$$

Therefore, the value of y is 2.5, rounded off to 1 decimal place. The correct answer is [2.5].
