To solve this question, we need to have a basic understanding of dislocations, their reactions, and how they relate to FCC and BCC metals. Below is the step-by-step explanation:

Step 1:
Understand the dislocation reactions in Column A. There are 3 dislocation reactions given in the column:

(P) $a_°$/2 [-1 -1 1] + $a_°$/2 [1 1 1] = $a_°$ [ 0 0 1]
(Q) $a_°$/6 [-1 2 -1 ] + $a_°$/6 [1 -1 2] = $a_°$/6 [0 1 1]
(R) $a_°$/6 [1 -2 1] + $a_°$/6[-1 -1 2] = $a_°$/2 [0 -1 1]

Step 2:
Understand the descriptions of dislocations COLUMN B:

(1) Leading partials merging to form a Lomer-Cottrell lock in an FCC metal.
(2) Energetically unfavorable dislocation reaction in an FCC metal.
(3) Typical dislocation reaction in a BCC metal.

Step 3:
Analyze the reactions given in Column A and associate them with the descriptions in Column B.

Reaction P: 
The reaction produces a screw dislocation [0 0 1]. This is not typical for BCC metals nor does it involve partials to form a Lomer-Cottrell lock in FCC metals. Hence, we assign P to Description (2).

Reaction Q:
The reaction produces edge dislocation $a_°$/6 [0 1 1]. Partial dislocations in FCC metals have indices like $a_°$/6. Since it involves merging of two leading partials, this reaction is associated with Description (1).

Reaction R:
The reaction produces a BCC-type dislocation $a_°$/2 [0 -1 1]. This is a typical dislocation reaction in a BCC metal. Hence, we assign R to Description (3).

Step 4:
Combine the associations from step 3 to match the given options.

P - 2, Q - 1, R - 3

Comparing it to the options provided, we find the correct answer is:

(D) P - 2, Q - 1, R - 3
