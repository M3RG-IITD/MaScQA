To solve this problem, we will use the Classical Nucleation Theory (CNT). According to CNT, the Gibbs free energy change ($\Delta G$) during nucleation can be expressed as:

$$
\Delta G = 4\pi R^2 \sigma + \frac{4}{3}\pi R^3 \Delta G_v
$$

where:
- $R$ is the nucleus radius
- $\sigma$ is the solid/liquid interface energy = 0.177 J/m²
- $\Delta G_v$ is the volumetric free energy change

The volumetric free energy change during nucleation can be calculated using the undercooling temperature ($\Delta T$) and the following formula:

$$
\Delta G_v = \frac{\Delta H_f}{T_m} \Delta T
$$

where:
- $\Delta H_f$ is the latent heat of fusion = 1.88 × $10^9$ J/m³
- $T_m$ is the melting point of the metal = 1356 K
- $\Delta T$ is the undercooling temperature = 10 K

Now, let's calculate the volumetric free energy change:

$$
\Delta G_v = \frac{1.88 \times 10^9}{1356} \times 10
$$

$$
\Delta G_v \approx 1.386 \times 10^7 J/m^3
$$

For a critical nucleus, the Gibbs free energy change is at its maximum, which means its derivative with respect to the nucleus radius is zero:

$$
\frac{d\Delta G}{dR} = 0
$$

Differentiating the $\Delta G$ equation and setting it to zero, we get:

$$
8\pi R \sigma + 4\pi R^2 \Delta G_v = 0
$$

Now, we will solve for the critical nucleus radius $R^*$:

$$
R^* = -\frac{8\sigma}{4\Delta G_v}
$$

Plugging in the given values, we get:

$$
R^* = -\frac{8 \times 0.177}{4 \times 1.386 \times 10^7}
$$

$$
R^* \approx -2.558 \times 10^{-9} m
$$

Since the radius cannot be negative, we must take the absolute value:

$$
R^* \approx 2.558 \times 10^{-9} m
$$

Now, let's convert the radius to nanometers:

$$
R^* \approx 2.558 \times 10^{-9} \times 10^9 nm
$$

$$
R^* \approx 2.6 nm
$$

Thus, the radius of the critical nucleus at an undercooling of 10 K is approximately 2.6 nm, rounded off to one decimal place.

So the answer is: [2.6].
