Given data:

Eutectoid composition = 0.8 wt% C

Temperature at which eutectoid composition occurs = 725°C

Maximum solubility of carbon in α-ferrite phase = 0.025 wt% C

Carbon content in steel sample = 0.5 wt% C

To find: Fraction of pro-eutectoid α-ferrite in the steel sample at room temperature

First, we need to determine the phases that will be present in the steel sample at room temperature. For this, we need to construct the Fe-Fe3C phase diagram using the given data.

Fe-Fe3C phase diagram:

From the phase diagram, we can see that the eutectoid composition of 0.8 wt% C corresponds to the formation of pearlite (a mixture of α-ferrite and cementite) at 725°C. At higher carbon concentrations, the primary phase is cementite, and at lower carbon concentrations, the primary phase is α-ferrite.

The maximum solubility of carbon in α-ferrite phase is 0.025 wt% C. This means that any carbon concentration above 0.025 wt% C will result in the formation of cementite as the primary phase.

The steel sample has a carbon content of 0.5 wt% C, which is much higher than the maximum solubility of carbon in α-ferrite phase. Therefore, we can assume that the primary phase in the steel sample is cementite.

Now, we need to determine the fraction of pro-eutectoid α-ferrite that forms before the eutectoid transformation occurs. For this, we can use the lever rule.

Lever rule:

where,

L = length of the tie line intersecting the phase boundary of interest

x = distance from the phase boundary to the composition of interest

Using the lever rule, we can determine the fraction of pro-eutectoid α-ferrite that forms before the eutectoid transformation occurs. The tie line that intersects the eutectoid composition of 0.8 wt% C is shown in the Fe-Fe3C phase diagram.

The length of the tie line is approximately 6.5 wt% C. The distance from the eutectoid composition to the carbon content of the steel sample (0.5 wt% C) is 0.8 - 0.5 = 0.3 wt% C.

Using the lever rule,

Fraction of pro-eutectoid α-ferrite = x/L = 0.3/6.5 = 0.046

Therefore, the fraction of pro-eutectoid α-ferrite in the steel sample at room temperature is 0.046.

However, the question asks for the fraction of pro-eutectoid α-ferrite, not the total fraction of α-ferrite. Since pearlite is a mixture of α-ferrite and cementite, we need to consider the fraction of cementite as well.

Fraction of cementite = 1 - fraction of pro-eutectoid α-ferrite = 1 - 0.046 = 0.954

Therefore, the fraction of pro-eutectoid α-ferrite in the steel sample at room temperature is:

Fraction of pro-eutectoid α-ferrite = (fraction of α-ferrite)/(fraction of α-ferrite + fraction of cementite) = 0.046/(0.046 + 0.954) = 0.046
