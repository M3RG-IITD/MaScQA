The heat input per unit length of the weld can be calculated using the following formula: 

$H = \frac{V \times I}{S \times E}$

where,
V = Arc voltage
I = Welding current
S = Welding speed 
E = Arc heat transfer efficiency 

For the first weld, 
$H_1 = \frac{(18 V) \times (200 A)}{(0.002 m/s) \times (0.65)} = 138461.5 J/m$

For the second weld, since both the welds have identical heat input per unit length, we can equate $H_1$ and $H_2$ and solve for the welding current (I2). 

$H_2 = \frac{(18 V) \times (I_2)}{(0.0022 m/s) \times (0.65)} = 138461.5 J/m$

Solving for I2, we get 
$I_2 = \frac{(138461.5 J/m) \times (0.0022 m/s) \times (0.65)}{(18 V)} \approx 220 A$

Therefore, the welding current of the second weld is 220 amperes (rounded off to the nearest integer). 

Answer: 

- 220
