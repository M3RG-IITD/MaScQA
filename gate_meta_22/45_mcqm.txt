A non-rotating smooth solid spherical object is fixed in the stream of an inviscid incompressible fluid of density 𝜌 (see figure). The flow is horizontal, slow, steady, and fully developed far from the object as shown by the streamline arrows near point O. Which of the following statement(s) is(are) TRUE? (Note: B is the center of the sphere and the straight horizontal line OAB intersects the surface of the sphere at the point A.) 
(A) The velocity of the fluid at the point A is zero (B) The fluid pressure at the point A exceeds that at point O by the amount 𝜌$v^2$/2 , where 𝒗 is the fluid velocity at point O (C) Fluid moving precisely along OA will turn perpendicular to OA to circumvent the object (D) On each side of the central streamline OA, the flow will be deflected round the object
