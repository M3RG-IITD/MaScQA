The correct dimensionless number that describes the transition from laminar to turbulent flow is (A) Reynolds number.

Explanation:

Reynolds number (Re) is a dimensionless number used to describe the type of flow of a fluid. It is defined as the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces within a fluid, and it determines whether a fluid flow is considered laminar or turbulent. 

Laminar flow occurs when a fluid flows in smooth layers, with little or no mixing between the layers. It is characterized by low Reynolds number. 

On the other hand, turbulent flow occurs when the fluid flows chaotically and mix thoroughly. It is characterized by high Reynolds number. 

Hence, Reynolds number is the dimensionless number that describes the transition from laminar to turbulent flow. The correct answer is (A) Reynolds number.
