To find the thickness of the germanium crystal layer that would absorb 80% of the incident radiation, we'll use the Beer-Lambert law. The Beer-Lambert law relates the absorption of light to the properties of the material through which the light is traveling.

The formula for the Beer-Lambert law is:

$T = I_t / I_0 = e^(-αd)$

where
- $T$ is the transmittance, the fraction of incident light that is transmitted through the material
- $I_t$ is the transmitted intensity of the light
- $I_0$ is the incident intensity of the light
- $α$ is the absorption coefficient (given as $3.3 * 10^5 m^{-1}$)
- $d$ is the thickness of the material, which we want to find

Since we want the germanium crystal layer to absorb 80% of the incident radiation, the transmittance $T$ should be 20%, or 0.2. Now we can solve for $d$.

$0.2 = e^(-αd)$

Take the natural logarithm of both sides:

$ln(0.2) = -αd$

Now, isolate $d$ by dividing both sides by $-α$:

$d = ln(0.2) / -α$

Substitute the given value of $α = 3.3 * 10^5 m^{-1}$:

$d = ln(0.2) / -(3.3 * 10^5 m^{-1})$

Calculate the thickness:

$d ≈ 3.90 * 10^{-6} m$

Since we want the thickness in micrometers (µm), we can convert meters to micrometers by multiplying by 10^6:

$d ≈ 3.90 * 10^{-6} m * (10^6 µm / 1 m) ≈ 3.90 µm$

Therefore, the required thickness of the germanium crystal layer to absorb 80% of the incident radiation at 1.3 µm is approximately 3.90 µm.
