To estimate the porosity of the composite, we can use the linear rule of mixtures to find the theoretical density of the composite first. The linear rule of mixtures states that the overall property of a composite material is the weighted average of its constituent materials' properties.

In this case, the overall property we're interested in is the density (ρ) of the composite.

ρ_composite = ρ_SiC * V_SiC + ρ_Al2O3 * V_Al2O3

where,
ρ_SiC is the density of SiC whiskers (3.22 g/cm³)
V_SiC is the volume fraction of SiC whiskers in the composite (0.3)
ρ_Al2O3 is the density of Al₂O₃ matrix (3.95 g/cm³)
V_Al2O3 is the volume fraction of Al₂O₃ matrix in the composite (1 - V_SiC = 0.7)

ρ_composite = (3.22 * 0.3) + (3.95 * 0.7)
ρ_composite = 0.966 + 2.765
ρ_composite ≈ 3.731 g/cm³

Now that we have the theoretical density of the composite, we can find the porosity by comparing it with the measured bulk density (ρ_bulk = 3.65 g/cm³).

Porosity (%) = ((ρ_composite - ρ_bulk) / ρ_composite) * 100
Porosity (%) = ((3.731 - 3.65) / 3.731) * 100
Porosity (%) ≈ (0.081 / 3.731) * 100
Porosity (%) ≈ 2.17 %

So, the estimated porosity of the composite is about 2.17 %. The correct answer is [2.17].
