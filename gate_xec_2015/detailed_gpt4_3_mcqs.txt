Teflon is the brand name for polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), a high-performance plastic. To identify the category of materials it belongs to, let's take a look at the definitions of each category:

(A) Thermosets: Thermosetting polymers are materials that undergo a polymerization process, during which they irreversibly harden. This means they can't be melted and re-molded once they have set.

(B) Thermoplastics: Thermoplastic polymers are materials that can be repeatedly melted and re-molded upon application of heat. They have a reversible physical change upon heating and cooling.

(C) Elastomers: These are rubber-like materials with high elasticity, meaning they can return to their original shape after significant stretching or deformation.

(D) Block copolymers: These are polymers made up of two or more different types of monomers, arranged in a linear sequence (blocks) of each type. This gives them unique properties that are dependent on the combination of monomers used.

Now let's analyze Teflon (PTFE):

Teflon (PTFE) is a high-performance plastic known for its non-stick properties, chemical and heat resistance. It can be melted and re-molded multiple times, meaning it undergoes a reversible physical change upon heating and cooling. This characteristic fits the description of a thermoplastic polymer.

Therefore, Teflon (PTFE) belongs to the category:
