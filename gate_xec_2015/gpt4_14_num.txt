First, we need to find the number of moles in the 1 kg sacrificial anode of Mg.

1 kg = 1000 g

Number of moles = mass / molar mass
Number of moles = 1000 g / (24.31 g/mol) = 41.14 mol

Next, we need to find the number of electrons exchanged during the corrosion of 1 mole of Mg. Magnesium loses 2 electrons to form Mg2+:

Mg â†’ Mg2+ + 2e-

Since there are 41.14 moles of Mg, the total number of electrons exchanged is:

Total number of electrons = 2 * 41.14 mol = 82.28 mol

Now, we need to calculate the total charge (in Coulombs) associated with these electrons. The charge of 1 mole of electrons can be found using Faraday's constant:

1 Faraday = 96485 Coulombs/mol

Total charge transferred = 82.28 mol * 96485 C/mol = 7941494 C

Next, we need to find the time over which the anode lasts, in seconds:

60 days = 60 * 24 * 3600 s = 5184000 s

Finally, we can calculate the average corrosion current (I) by dividing the total charge (Q) by the time (t):

I = Q / t
I = 7941494 C / 5184000 s = 1.53 A

So, the average corrosion current is 1.53 Amperes.

Answer: [1.53]
