To calculate the increase in mass of the electron, we can use the formula for relativistic mass, which is given by:

m = m0 / √(1 - (v^2/c^2))

where m is the relativistic mass, m0 is the rest mass of the electron, v is its velocity, and c is the speed of light.

We are given that the electron is traveling at 96% of the speed of light, so:

v = 0.96c

We want to find the factor by which the mass increases. Let's call this factor x. Then we have:

m = x * m0

Now, we can substitute this expression into the relativistic mass formula:

x * m0 = m0 / √(1 - (0.96c)^2/c^2)

Cancel out the m0 from both sides:

x = 1 / √(1 - (0.96c)^2/c^2)

Now, we can simplify the expression:

x = 1 / √(1 - 0.96^2)

x = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216)

x ≈ 1 / √(0.0784)

x ≈ 1 / 0.28

x ≈ 3.57

So the mass of the electron would increase about 3.57 times its original mass if it travels at 96% of the speed of light.

The correct answer is [3.57].
