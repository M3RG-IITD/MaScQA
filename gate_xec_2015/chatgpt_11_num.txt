According to Einstein's theory of relativity, the mass of an object increases as its velocity approaches the speed of light. This can be described by the following equation:

m = m₀ / (sqrt(1 - v²/c²))

where:

m₀ = rest mass of the object
v = velocity of the object
c = speed of light

In this case, we know that:

v = 0.96c (because the electron is traveling at 96% of the speed of light)

So we can plug in these values and solve for m/m₀:

m/m₀ = 1 / (sqrt(1 - (0.96c)²/c²))
m/m₀ = 1 / (sqrt(1 - 0.9216))
m/m₀ = 1 / 0.388
m/m₀ = 2.57

Therefore, the mass of the electron would increase by a factor of 2.57 if it traveled at 96% of the speed of light.

Answer: [2.57 or approximately 2.6]
