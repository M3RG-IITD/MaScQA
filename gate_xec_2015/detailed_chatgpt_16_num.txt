First, we can use the linear rule of mixtures to estimate the theoretical density of the composite:
$$ \rho_{th} = \rho_{Al_2O_3} (1 - V_f) + \rho_{SiC}V_f $$
where $\rho_{Al_2O_3}$ and $\rho_{SiC}$ are the theoretical densities of $Al_2O_3$ and SiC, respectively, and $V_f$ is the volume fraction of SiC in the composite. Substituting the given values, we have:
$$ \rho_{th} = (3.95 \text{ g/cm}^3)(1-0.30) + (3.22 \text{ g/cm}^3)(0.30) = 3.542 \text{ g/cm}^3 $$
The porosity, $\epsilon$, of the composite can then be calculated as:
$$ \epsilon = \frac{\rho_{th} - \rho_{bulk}}{\rho_{th}} $$
where $\rho_{bulk}$ is the measured bulk density of the composite. Substituting the given values, we have:
$$ \epsilon = \frac{3.542 \text{ g/cm}^3 - 3.65 \text{ g/cm}^3}{3.542 \text{ g/cm}^3} \times 100\% \approx 3.03\% $$
Therefore, the porosity of the composite is approximately 3.03%. 

Answer: 
- 3.03%
