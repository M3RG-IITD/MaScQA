The mass of the Mg anode is 1 kg, and its atomic weight is 24.31 amu. Therefore, the number of moles of Mg in the anode is:

moles = mass / atomic weight
moles = 1 kg / (24.31 g/mol)
moles = 41.13 mol

The duration for which the anode lasts is 60 days, which is equal to 5,184,000 seconds. The Faraday constant is 96,485 C/mol.

The number of electrons transferred during the corrosion of the anode can be calculated as follows:

electrons = moles of Mg x 2 x Faraday constant
electrons = 41.13 mol x 2 x 96,485 C/mol
electrons = 7,936,564 C

Therefore, the average corrosion current is:

corrosion current = total charge / time
corrosion current = 7,936,564 C / 5,184,000 s
corrosion current = 1.53 A

Answer:
The average corrosion current during the 60 days is 1.53 A.
