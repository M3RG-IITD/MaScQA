To arrange the elements in order of their increasing melting points, we can refer to the periodic table and consider the following factors:

1. Metallic Character: Metals generally have high melting points since they form metallic bonds which are strong. As we move across a period, the metallic character decreases and as we move down a group, the metallic character increases.

2. Atomic Size: In general, as the atomic size increases, the melting point of the element decreases because larger atoms have weaker metallic bonding due to their less effective electron shielding.

Now, let's analyze the given elements:

P: Gallium (Ga) - Group 13, Period 4
Q: Tungsten (W) - Group 6, Period 6
R: Aluminium (Al) - Group 13, Period 3
S: Gold (Au) - Group 11, Period 6

Comparing P and R:

Both gallium and aluminum are in the same group, but gallium is in a lower period, which means it has a larger atomic size and thus lower melting point. So, P < R.

Comparing Q and S:

Tungsten is in the same period as gold but in a group with higher metallic character, which indicates that tungsten has a stronger metallic bond and a higher melting point. Therefore, S < Q.

Now we need to compare R (aluminium) and S (gold):

Aluminium is in a higher group and a lower period than gold, which indicates that it generally has a higher metallic character and smaller atomic size. So, it should have a higher melting point than gold. Thus, S < R.

Putting the orders together, we have: P < R < S < Q.

Hence, the correct answer is (C) P < R < S < Q.
