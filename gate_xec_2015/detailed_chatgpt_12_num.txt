We know that the linear thermal expansion coefficient of iron is 11.0 * $10^(-6)$ $K^(-1)$. This means that for every 1 degree Celsius increase in temperature, the length of the iron rail track will increase by 11.0 * $10^(-6)$ cm for every cm of length. 

So, if the temperature increases by (45-15) = 30Â°C, then the length of the iron rail track would increase by 

30 * 11.0 * $10^(-6)$ = 0.00033 cm (for every cm of length)

However, we are given that the length of the iron rail track increases by 0.05 cm. Therefore, we can calculate the original length as follows:

Let x be the original length of the iron rail track in cm. 

Then, we can write the equation:

0.00033 * x = 0.05 

Solving for x: 

x = 0.05 / 0.00033 = 151.52 cm 

Therefore, the original length of the iron rail track was 151.52 cm. 

Answer: 
- 151.52 cm
