The correct order of increasing melting point is:

(A) P < R < Q < S

Explanation: 

Out of the given options, we know that tungsten has the highest melting point and should be placed at the end. Gold has a higher melting point than aluminium, while gallium has the lowest melting point of all. Therefore, the correct order would be: 

gallium < aluminium < gold < tungsten 

or 

P < R < S < Q 

which matches option (A).
