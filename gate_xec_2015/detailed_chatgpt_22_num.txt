The maximum number of electron-hole pairs that can be generated in a semiconductor detector is given by the energy of the incident photon divided by the bandgap energy of the semiconductor material. 

The bandgap of silicon is given as 1.1 eV. We need to convert the energy of the incident x-ray photon to eV, which is 1.54 keV = 1540 eV.

Therefore, the maximum number of electron-hole pairs that can be generated in the silicon detector is:

1540 eV / 1.1 eV = 1400 electron-hole pairs.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

- Maximum number of electron-hole pairs = 1400.
