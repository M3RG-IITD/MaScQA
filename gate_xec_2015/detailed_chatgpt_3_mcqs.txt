Teflon (PTFE) belongs to the category of materials called Thermoplastics.

Explanation:
Teflon (PTFE) is a type of plastic known as a fluoropolymer, and more specifically a thermoplastic. Thermoplastics are a type of plastic that can be melted and re-molded multiple times without significant degradation of their properties. Other common thermoplastics include polyethylene, polypropylene, PVC, and nylon. Thermosets, on the other hand, cannot be melted and re-molded once they have been formed into a specific shape. Elastomers are a type of rubber that have elastic properties and can be stretched and returned to their original shape. Block copolymers are made up of multiple chemically distinct blocks of polymers that are linked together.
