In order to arrange the given elements in order of increasing melting point, we need to consider the nature and bonding of these elements as well as their atomic structure.

- Gallium (P) has a melting point of 29.76째C and is a metal that belongs to group 13 of the periodic table. It has a low melting point and is a soft metal.

- Aluminium (R) has a melting point of 660.32째C and is a metal that belongs to group 13 of the periodic table. It has a higher melting point compared to gallium due to its stronger metallic bonding.

- Gold (S) has a melting point of 1064.18째C and is a metal that belongs to group 11 of the periodic table. It has a higher melting point compared to aluminium due to its stronger metallic bonding.

- Tungsten (Q) has a melting point of 3422째C and is a metal that belongs to group 6 of the periodic table. It has the highest melting point among the given elements due to its strong metallic bonding and high atomic mass.

Based on the above analysis, we can arrange the elements in order of increasing melting point as follows:

P < R < S < Q

Therefore, the correct answer is option (C) P < R < S < Q.
