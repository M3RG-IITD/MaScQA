The formula for the fraction of radiation absorbed is:

$\frac{I_t}{I_o} = e^{-\alpha t}$,

where $I_o$ is the intensity of the incident radiation, $I_t$ is the intensity of the transmitted radiation, $\alpha$ is the absorption coefficient, and $t$ is the thickness of the material.

Using this formula, we can solve for the thickness of the germanium layer:

$0.2 = e^{- 3.3 \times 10^5 \times 10^{-4} \times t}$

$t = \frac{- \ln{0.2}}{3.3 \times 10^5 \times 10^{-4}} \approx 5.5 \  \mu m$

Therefore, the thickness of the germanium layer that would be required for absorbing 80% of the incident radiation is approximately 5.5 µm.

Answer: 

- 5.5 µm
