The volume of the unit cell of an fcc lattice is equal to the cube of the lattice parameter (a^3), multiplied by 4/3 times pi.

V = a^3 * 4/3 * pi

V = (0.365 * 10^(-9) m)^3 * 4/3 * 3.14159 

V = 4.43717 * 10^(-26) m^3 


The number of unit cells per unit volume (Z) is equal to 1 divided by the volume of the unit cell.

Z = 1 / V 


The atomic weight of copper is 63.54 amu. One mole of copper contains 6.022 * 10^23 atoms.


The mass of one unit cell (m) can be calculated by multiplying the atomic weight of copper by the number of atoms in a unit cell and dividing by Avogadro's number. 

m = 63.54 amu * 4 / 6.022 * 10^23


m = 1.05534 * 10^(-25) kg


The density of copper can be calculated by multiplying the mass of one unit cell by the number of unit cells per unit volume.

Density = Z * m

Density = [1 / (0.365 * 10^(-9) m)^3 * 4/3 * 3.14159] * 1.05534 * 10^(-25) kg


Density = 8,960 kg/m^3


Answer: The density of copper is 8,960 kg/m^3.
