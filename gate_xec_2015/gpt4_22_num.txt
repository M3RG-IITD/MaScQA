To find the maximum number of electron-hole pairs generated by the x-ray, we can divide the energy of the x-ray by the energy required to create an electron-hole pair (the band gap energy).

Energy of x-ray = 1.54 keV = 1540 eV
Band gap of silicon = 1.1 eV

Maximum number of electron-hole pairs = (Energy of x-ray) / (Band gap of silicon) = 1540 eV / 1.1 eV â‰ˆ 1400

The maximum number of electron-hole pairs that can be generated using a silicon detector irradiated by x-ray of energy 1.54 keV is approximately 1400.
