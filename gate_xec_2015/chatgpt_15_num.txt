To find the capacitance of a capacitor, we can use the formula:

$C = \frac{\epsilon A}{d}$

where $C$ is the capacitance, $\epsilon$ is the permittivity of the dielectric material, $A$ is the area of the electrodes, and $d$ is the distance between the electrodes.

In this case, we are given the thickness of the $BaTiO_3$ dielectric material, which we can use as the distance between the electrodes:

$d = 0.075 \, cm$

We are also given the area of the electrodes:

$A = 0.2 \, cm^2$

And we know the dielectric constant of the $BaTiO_3$ material:

$\epsilon = \epsilon_0 \epsilon_r = 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \, F/m \times 2000 = 1.77 \times 10^{-8} \, F/m$

where $\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space.

Now we can plug these values into the formula to find the capacitance:

$C = \frac{\epsilon A}{d} = \frac{1.77 \times 10^{-8} \, F/m \times 0.2 \, cm^2}{0.075 \, cm} = 4.72 \times 10^{-11} \, F$

To convert from farads to nanofarads, we can divide by $10^{-9}$:

$C = \frac{4.72 \times 10^{-11} \, F}{10^{-9}} = 0.0472 \, nF$

Therefore, the capacitance of this capacitor is 0.0472 nF.
