The correct match for the techniques and characteristics are as follows:

P. DSC (Differential Scanning Calorimetry) measures Glass transition temperature, so P-2.
Q. XRD (X-Ray Diffraction) measures Crystal structure, so Q-4.
R. STM (Scanning Tunneling Microscope) measures Density of states, so R-1.
S. SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) can measure Cathodoluminescence, so S-3.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) P-2, Q-4, R-1, S-3. 

Answer: [(C)]
