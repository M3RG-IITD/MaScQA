To estimate the porosity of the composite, we first need to find the theoretical density of the composite using the linear rule of mixtures.

Step 1: Find the theoretical density of the composite
The linear rule of mixtures states that the theoretical density of a composite can be obtained by taking the weighted average of the densities of its components. In this case, we have 30 volume % SiC whiskers and 70 volume % $Al_2O_3$ matrix. 

Theoretical density of composite ($\rho_c$) = (Volume fraction of SiC) * (Density of SiC) + (Volume fraction of $Al_2O_3$) * (Density of $Al_2O_3$)

Let the volume fractions of SiC and $Al_2O_3$ be represented by V1 and V2, respectively.

V1 = 0.30 (30%)
V2 = 0.70 (70%)

Now, we can find the theoretical density of the composite:

$\rho_c$ = V1 * $\rho_{SiC}$ + V2 * $\rho_{Al_2O_3}$
$\rho_c$ = 0.30 * 3.22 g $cm^{-3}$ + 0.70 * 3.95 g $cm^{-3}$

Calculate $\rho_c$:
$\rho_c$ = 0.30 * 3.22 + 0.70 * 3.95
$\rho_c$ = 0.966 + 2.765
$\rho_c$ = 3.731 g $cm^{-3}$

Step 2: Estimate the porosity of the composite
Porosity is the percentage of void space or pores in the material. We can determine the porosity by comparing the measured bulk density of the composite with its theoretical density.

Porosity (%) = $\frac{(\text{Theoretical density} - \text{Measured bulk density})}{\text{Theoretical density}}$ * 100

Porosity (%) = $\frac{(3.731 - 3.65)}{3.731}$ * 100

Calculate the porosity:
Porosity (%) = $\frac{(0.081)}{3.731}$ * 100
Porosity (%) â‰ˆ 2.17 %

Therefore, the estimated porosity of the hot pressed ceramic composite material is approximately 2.17%.
