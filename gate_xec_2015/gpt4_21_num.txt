We need to first find the volume of the unit cell:

The volume V of a unit cell for an fcc lattice can be found using the following formula:

V = a³, where a is the lattice parameter.

We are given the lattice parameter a = 0.365 nm = 3.65 × 10⁻¹⁰ m.
Let's calculate the volume:

V = (3.65 × 10⁻¹⁰)³ = 4.87 × 10⁻²⁹ $m^3$.

In an fcc lattice, there are 4 atoms per unit cell. Since each corner atom is shared by 8 adjacent cells and there are 12 atoms on the edges shared by 4 adjacent cells:
Total atoms per unit cell = 8*(1/8) + 12*(1/4) = 1 + 3 = 4 atoms.

Next, we need to find the mass of 4 copper atoms:

Copper's atomic weight is 63.54 amu, and we know that 1 amu is approximately equal to 1.66 × 10⁻²⁷ kg:

mass of one Cu atom = 63.54 amu × (1.66 × 10⁻²⁷ kg/amu) = 1.055 × 10⁻²⁵ kg.

So, the mass of 4 Cu atoms = 4 × 1.055 × 10⁻²⁵ kg = 4.22 × 10⁻²⁵ kg.

Finally, we can find the density of copper ρ using the formula:

ρ = mass/volume.

ρ = (4.22 × 10⁻²⁵ kg) / (4.87 × 10⁻²⁹ $m^3$) = 8669 kg $m^(-3)$ (approximately).

So, the density of copper is approximately 8669 kg $m^(-3)$.

Answer: [8669].
