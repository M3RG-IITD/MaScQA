Let the conductivity of the intrinsic semiconductor be given by
$$\sigma=\sigma_0\exp\left(\frac{-E_g}{kT}\right)$$
where $\sigma_0$ is the intrinsic conductivity, $E_g$ is the energy gap and $k$ is the Boltzmann constant.

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we have
$$\log_e \sigma = \log_e \sigma_0 -\frac{E_g}{kT}$$
Rearranging, we get
$$\log_e \sigma_0 = \log_e \sigma +\frac{E_g}{kT}$$
Comparing with the equation $y=mx+c$, we can see that $\log_e \sigma_0$ is the $y$-intercept, $m$ is $-\frac{E_g}{k}$ and $x$ is $\frac{1}{T}$. Therefore, the slope of the graph is $-\frac{E_g}{k}$.
Hence, the correct option is $\boxed{\mathrm{(D)}}$ $-\frac{E_g}{k}$.
