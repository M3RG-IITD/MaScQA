We can solve this problem using the formula for linear thermal expansion, which is:

ΔL = α * L₀ * ΔT

where

ΔL = change in length (0.05 cm)
α = linear thermal expansion coefficient (11.0 * 10^(-6) K^(-1))
L₀ = original length, which we need to find 
ΔT = change in temperature (45°C - 15°C = 30°C)

First, let's isolate the original length (L₀) by dividing both sides of the equation by α * ΔT:

L₀ = ΔL / (α * ΔT)

Now we can plug in the values given in the problem:

L₀ = 0.05 cm / ((11.0 * 10^(-6) K^(-1)) * 30°C)

Next, we can perform the calculation step by step:

L₀ = 0.05 cm / (330 * 10^(-6) K)

L₀ = 0.05 cm / 3.3 * 10^(-4)

Now, divide the numerator by the denominator:

L₀ ≈ 0.05 cm / 3.3 * 10^(-4) ≈ 151.52 cm

So, the original length of the iron rail track is approximately 151.52 cm.

Answer: [151.52]
