To solve this question, we need to understand the properties and applications of each technical ceramic listed in Column I.

P. Y-doped $ZrO_2$ (Yttria-stabilized zirconia): This is a well-known ionic conductor and is used as an oxygen sensor due to its high oxygen ion conductivity. So, P matches with 4.

Q. $UO_2$ (Uranium dioxide): This is a commonly used nuclear fuel due to its high thermal conductivity and good fission product retention. So, Q matches with 5.

R. $Si_3N_4$ (Silicon nitride): This ceramic has excellent mechanical strength, oxidation resistance, and high-temperature capabilities, making it ideal for high-temperature turbine engine components. So, R matches with 2.

S. AlN (Aluminum nitride): This ceramic has high thermal conductivity and excellent electrical insulation, making it a suitable substrate material for integrated circuits. So, S matches with 3.

T. Cr-doped $Al_2O_3$ (Chromium-doped alumina): Chromium doping in alumina results in an intense red color, and the material is used as a solid-state laser due to its excellent optical properties. So, T matches with 1.

Therefore, the correct matching is:

P-4, Q-5, R-2, S-3, T-1, which corresponds to option (B). 

Answer: [B].
