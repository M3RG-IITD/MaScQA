To find the capacitance of the capacitor, we can use the formula:

C = (ε * A) / d

where C is the capacitance, ε is the permittivity of the dielectric material (which equals the dielectric constant, κ, times the permittivity of free space, ε₀ = 8.854 x 10⁻¹² F/m), A is the electrode area, and d is the thickness of the dielectric.

First, let's convert everything to meters for consistency:

Thickness (d) = 0.075 cm = 0.00075 m
Area (A) = 0.2 cm² = 0.00002 m²

Now we can find the permittivity of the material:

ε = κ * ε₀ = 2000 * 8.854 x 10⁻¹² F/m ≈ 1.7708 x 10⁻⁸ F/m

Now we can calculate the capacitance:

C = (ε * A) / d = (1.7708 x 10⁻⁸ F/m * 0.00002 m²) / 0.00075 m ≈ 4.7216 x 10⁻¹² F

To convert the capacitance to nanofarads (nF), we can multiply by 10⁹:

C = 4.7216 x 10⁻¹² F * 10⁹ = 4.7216 nF

Thus, the capacitance of this capacitor is approximately 4.7216 nF.

The correct answer inside a list is: [4.7216]
