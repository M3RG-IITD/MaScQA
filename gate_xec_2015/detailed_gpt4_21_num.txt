To find the density of copper, we will use the following formula:

$$density = \frac{mass}{volume}$$

First, we will find the volume of the unit cell, and then calculate the mass of copper atoms within the volume. Finally, we will convert this to the mass of a 1 m³ of copper, and then we can find its density.

1. Calculate the volume of the unit cell:
Copper has a face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice with a lattice parameter (edge length) of 0.365 nm. Since the volume of a cube is given by V = a³, where a is the edge length:

$$V = (0.365 * 10^{-9} m)^3 = 48.54 * 10^{-27} m^3$$

2. Determine the number of atoms in the unit cell:
Copper has one atom at each of the eight corners of the unit cell and six atoms at the center of the faces. Each corner atom is shared by eight other adjacent unit cells, and each face atom is shared by two adjacent unit cells.

The total number of atoms in one unit cell is, therefore:

$$\frac{8}{8}+\frac{6}{2}=1+3=4$$

3. Find the mass of the copper atoms in the unit cell:
The atomic weight of copper is 63.54 amu, which can be converted to its mass in kg as follows:

$$\frac{63.54\ g}{1\ mol} * \frac{1\ mol}{6.022*10^{23}\ atoms} * \frac{1\ kg}{1000\ g} = 1.055 * 10^{-25} kg$$

Now, multiply this mass by the number of atoms in one unit cell:

$$1.055 * 10^{-25} kg/atom * 4\ atoms = 4.22 * 10^{-25} kg$$

4. Calculate the density of copper:
Now we can determine the density of copper by dividing the mass of the atoms in one unit cell by the volume of the unit cell:

$$density = \frac{4.22 * 10^{-25} kg}{48.54 * 10^{-27} m^3} = 8.69 * 10^3 kg/m^3$$

So, the density of copper is approximately 8690 kg/m³.
