The eutectic reaction involves two or more solid phases that melt and solidify at a fixed temperature to form a liquid phase. The correct option should represent the reaction between solid phases that undergo a eutectic transformation.

Here, option (A) represents the transformation of one solid phase into two solid phases, which is not a eutectic reaction.

Option (B) represents the transformation of a single liquid phase into two solid phases, which is not a eutectic reaction either.

Option (C) represents the formation of two different liquid phases upon melting of a solid and a liquid phase. This is not a eutectic reaction.

Option (D) represents the transformation of a solid and a liquid phase into two different solid phases upon cooling. This is a eutectic reaction.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

- (D) L1 + S1 â‡” S2 + S3
