The capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor with a dielectric in between is given by:

$C = \frac{\epsilon A}{d}$

where $\epsilon$ is the permittivity of the dielectric, $A$ is the area of the plates, and $d$ is the distance between the plates.

In this case, we are given that the dielectric is $BaTiO_3$ with a dielectric constant $\epsilon_r$ of 2000, the electrode area $A$ is 0.2 $cm^2$, and the dielectric is 0.075 cm thick. 

We can start by calculating the permittivity of the dielectric:

$\epsilon = \epsilon_0 \epsilon_r$

where $\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space, which is 8.85 x $10^{-12}$ F/m.

$ \epsilon = (8.85 \times 10^{-12} F/m)(2000) = 1.77 \times 10^{-8} F/m $

Now we can plug in the values we have into the capacitance formula:

$C = \frac{\epsilon A}{d} = \frac{(1.77 \times 10^{-8} F/m)(0.2 \times 10^{-2} m^2)}{0.075 \times 10^{-2} m} = 4.72 \times 10^{-11} F$

Finally, we can convert this to nF by dividing by $10^{-9}$:

$C = 4.72 \times 10^{-11} F \div 10^{-9} = 0.0472 nF$

Therefore, the capacitance of the capacitor is 0.0472 nF.

Answer: 

- 0.0472 nF
