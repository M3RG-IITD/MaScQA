To solve this problem, we can use the formula for relativistic mass:

m = m0 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)

Where: 

- m is the relativistic mass of the electron
- m0 is the rest mass of the electron
- v is the velocity of the electron
- c is the speed of light

We are given that the electron is traveling at 96% of the speed of light, so we can substitute:

v = 0.96c

Now we can solve for m:

m = m0 / sqrt(1 - (0.96c)^2/c^2)
m = m0 / sqrt(1 - 0.96^2)
m = m0 / sqrt(0.08)
m = m0 / 0.2828

So, the relativistic mass of the electron is 3.535 times its rest mass. Therefore, the mass of the electron would increase 3.535 times its original mass if it travels at 96% of the speed of light.

Answer: [3.535]
