To understand the problem and solve it, let's first understand the basics of nucleation and solidification in metals.

Nucleation is the process of the formation of small solid particles (nuclei) during the solidification of a liquid metal. The number and size of these nuclei influence the resulting microstructure of the solid metal. 

Two factors that have a strong influence on the critical size of the solid nuclei are the temperature of the liquid metal and the temperature of the solidification.

As the temperature of the liquid metal decreases, the driving force for nucleation (i.e., the thermodynamic tendency for the system to solidify) increases. This is because, as the temperature decreases, the difference in free energy between the liquid and solid phases increases, making it more likely for the system to form solid nuclei.

On the other hand, as the temperature of the solidification decreases, the energy barrier for nucleation (i.e., the energy needed for the system to form a stable nucleus) decreases. This is because, as the temperature of solidification decreases, the Gibbs free energy of the system is reduced, making it more likely for the system to overcome the energy barrier for nucleation and form a stable nucleus.

Now let's analyze the given problem.

 1. Melting point of the metal is 600°C.
 2. Liquid metal can solidify at 500°C, 400°C, or 300°C by rapid cooling.

We need to find the relation between the critical size of the solid nuclei at different solidification temperatures.

Let's compare the solidification at 400°C and 500°C:

As the solidification temperature decreases from 500°C to 400°C, both the driving force for nucleation and the energy barrier for nucleation are affected.

The driving force for nucleation increases as the temperature of the liquid metal decreases, making it more likely for the system to form solid nuclei.

However, since the energy barrier for nucleation decreases as the temperature of solidification decreases, it becomes easier for the system to form stable nuclei. As a result, the critical size of the solid nuclei will be smaller at 400°C compared to 500°C.

Therefore, statement (B) is correct: the critical size of the solid nuclei is smaller for solidification at 400°C as compared to solidification at 500°C.

Now let's compare the solidification at 300°C:

Since the solidification temperature is even lower than both 400°C and 500°C, the energy barrier for nucleation will be further reduced, making it easier for the system to form stable nuclei. Therefore, the critical size of the solid nuclei will be the smallest at 300°C.

So, statement (D) is correct: the critical size of the solid nuclei is the smallest for solidification at 300°C.

In conclusion, the correct answers are:
