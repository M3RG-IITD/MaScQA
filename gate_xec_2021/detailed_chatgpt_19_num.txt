Given: 

Intrinsic charge concentration of Si, $n_i$ = 1.45 × $10^(10)$ $cm^(−3)$ 

Charge of an electron, e = 1.6 × $10^(−19)$ C

Doping concentration of phosphorous atoms, $n_d$ = $10^(16)cm^(−3)$

Drift mobility of electron, $\mu_n$ = 1350 $cm^(2)V^(−1)s^(−1)$

We know that electrical conductivity, $\sigma_n$ = $ne\mu_n$ where n is the number of electrons per unit volume.

To find the electrical conductivity, we need to find the number of electrons per unit volume.

The number of electrons per unit volume, n can be expressed as:

$n = n_i^2/n_d$

$n = (1.45 × 10^(10))^2/10^(16)$

$n = 2.1025 × 10^(3) cm^(−3)$

Now, the electrical conductivity, $\sigma_n$ = $ne\mu_n$

$\sigma_n$ = $2.1025 × 10^(3) × 1.6 × 10^(−19) × 1350$

$\sigma_n$ = 4.2992 × 10^(−13) 

$\sigma_n$ = 0.0 $Ω^(−1)m^(−1)$ (rounded off to nearest integer)

Therefore, the electrical conductivity in $Ω^(−1)m^(−1)$ is 0.
