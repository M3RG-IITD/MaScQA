The correct answer is:
(C) P-2; Q-1; R-3

Explanation: 
- Eutectoid reaction involves the transformation of one solid phase into two solid phases. Therefore, it matches with option 2.
- Martensitic transformation involves no diffusion. Therefore, it matches with option 1.
- Precipitation reaction occurs in supersaturated solutions. Therefore, it matches with option 3.

Hence, the correct matching is P-2; Q-1; R-3.
