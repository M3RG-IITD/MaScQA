We can use the formula for Vickers hardness, which relates the applied load to the surface area of the indentation:

$$H_V = \frac{2L}{d^2}$$

where $H_V$ is the Vickers hardness in kg $mm^{-2}$, $L$ is the applied load in kg, and $d$ is the average length of diagonals of the square indentation in mm.

In this case, $L=10$ kg and $d=0.5$ mm. We need to find the value of $H_V$.

The first step is to calculate the surface area of the indentation. Given that the indenter is a square-base diamond pyramid, we can assume that the indentation is also a square with sides equal to $d/\sqrt{2}$, which is the distance from the center of the square to one of its corners. Therefore, the surface area is:

$$A = \left(\frac{d}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{d^2}{2}$$

Substituting this into the formula for $H_V$, we get:

$$H_V = \frac{2L}{d^2/2} = \frac{4L}{d^2}$$

Plugging in the values of $L$ and $d$, we get:

$$H_V = \frac{4(10)}{(0.5)^2} = \frac{4(10)}{0.25} = 160$$

Therefore, the Vickers hardness is 160 kg $mm^{-2}$, rounded off to the nearest integer.

Answer: [160]
