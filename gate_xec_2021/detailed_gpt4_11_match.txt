Column I: 

(P) Quenching: A heat treatment process that involves rapid cooling of the material, usually by immersing it in water, oil, or other media. It is used to harden steel and increase its strength.

(Q) Annealing: A heat treatment process that involves heating the material to a specific temperature, then cooling it slowly, often within a furnace. The process is used to relieve internal stresses, refine the grain structure, and soften the material.

(R) Tempering: A heat treatment process that is performed after quenching to reduce the brittleness of steel and increase its toughness. The material is reheated to a lower temperature and then cooled slowly.

(S) Carburizing: A heat treatment process in which iron-based materials are heated in a controlled atmosphere with a carbon-rich gas. The material becomes enriched with carbon on its surface, which increases its hardness and wear resistance.

Column II:

(1) hardens the steel
(2) softens the cold worked steel
(3) toughens the steel
(4) hardens the surface of steel

Let's match the processes with their respective outcomes:

(P) Quenching: Hardens the steel, so P-1.
(Q) Annealing: Softens the cold-worked steel, so Q-2.
(R) Tempering: Toughens the steel, so R-3.
(S) Carburizing: Hardens the surface of steel, so S-4.

The correct answer is (C) P-1; Q-2; R-3; S-4.
