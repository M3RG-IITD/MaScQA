We can use the formula for Vickers hardness, which is:

$$H = \frac{2P}{d^2}$$

where:
- H is the Vickers hardness in kg $mm^{-2}$.
- P is the applied load in kg.
- d is the average length of the diagonals of the square indentation in mm.

Substituting the given values, we get:

$$ H = \frac{2\times 10}{0.5^2} \approx \boxed{160} \ kg \ mm^{-2} $$

Therefore, the Vickers hardness in kg $mm^{-2}$ is approximately 160 (rounded off to the nearest integer).
