Given that the transformation occurs at 1 atm pressure and 773 K with an enthalpy of transformation of 912 J/mol. We are also given the molar volumes of both phases α and β, and asked to find the pressure required for the transformation at 723 K. 

We can use the Clapeyron equation to solve this problem:

$$
\frac{dP}{dT} = \frac{ΔH}{TΔV}
$$

where $P$ is pressure, $T$ is temperature, $ΔH$ is the enthalpy change, and $ΔV$ is the change in molar volume.

First, let's calculate the change in molar volume, $ΔV$:

$$
ΔV = V_β - V_α = 7.317 cm^3 - 7.377 cm^3 = -0.06 cm^3
$$

To convert the change in molar volume to SI units (m³/mol), multiply it by $10^{-6}$:

$$
ΔV = -0.06 \times 10^{-6} m^3/mol
$$

Now we can find the slope $\frac{dP}{dT}$ at 1 atm (1.01325 × 10⁵ Pa) and 773 K:

$$
\frac{dP}{dT} = \frac{ΔH}{TΔV} = \frac{912\,J/mol}{773\,K \times -0.06 \times 10^{-6} m^3/mol} = -2.949 \times 10^{8}\,Pa\div K
$$

Since the slope, $\frac{dP}{dT}$ has been calculated, we can find the required pressure at 723 K by integrating with respect to $dT$:

$$
\int_1^P dP = -2.949 \times 10^8 \int_{773}^{723} \frac{1}{T'}dT'
$$

$$
P - P_1 = -2.949 \times 10^8 (\ln(723)-\ln(773))
$$

Now we can solve for $P$:

$$
P = P_1 - 2.949 \times 10^8 (\ln(723) - \ln(773))
$$

where $P_1 = 1\,atm = 1.01325 \times 10^5\,Pa$. Now substitute the given values and find $P$:

$$
P = 1.01325 \times 10^5 - 2.949 \times 10^8 (\ln(723) - \ln(773))
$$

$$
P = 1.01325 \times 10^5 + 2.949 \times 10^8 (\ln(773)-\ln(723)) ≈ 1.6226 \times 10^5\,Pa
$$

Finally, convert the pressure back to atm:

$$
P_{atm} = \frac{P}{ 1.01325 \times 10^5}
$$

$$
P_{atm} ≈ \frac{1.6226 \times 10^5}{1.01325 \times 10^5} ≈ 1.6\,atm
$$

Rounded off to the nearest integer, the required pressure for the α to β transformation to occur at 723 K is approximately 2 atm.

The correct answer is [2].
