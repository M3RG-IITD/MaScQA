Amino acids are the basic building blocks of proteins and peptides. They consist of an amino group (-NH2), a carboxyl group (-COOH), and a unique side chain (R group) attached to a central carbon atom. 

To form peptides and proteins, amino acids undergo a reaction known as peptide bond formation. The peptide bond is an amide bond that links the amino group of one amino acid to the carboxyl group of another amino acid. This reaction takes place in the presence of an enzyme and releases a water molecule, which classifies it as a condensation reaction.

Now, let's look at the given options and decide which one matches the description above:

(A) Addition polymerization: This is a type of polymerization where monomer units are added directly to the growing polymer chain without releasing any by-products. This is not applicable to the formation of peptides and proteins since a water molecule is released during peptide bond formation.

(B) Nucleophilic substitution: This is a type of reaction where a nucleophile (electron-rich species) displaces another species from a substrate. While amino acids do have nucleophilic amino groups (-NH2) that can potentially participate in nucleophilic substitution reactions, this is not the primary reaction observed during peptide bond formation.

(C) Condensation polymerization: This is a type of polymerization where monomers react to form larger molecules through the release of a smaller molecule as a byproduct (commonly water). This matches the description of peptide bond formation, where amino acids react to form peptides or proteins, and a water molecule is released.

(D) Hydration: This reaction involves the addition of water to a molecule. This is not applicable to the formation of peptides and proteins, as the process actually involves the release of water during peptide bond formation.

Based on the analysis above, the correct answer is:

[C] Condensation polymerization
