Let X = wt.% of A in the alloy.
The wt.% of A in α phase = 70% of weight of α phase = 0.7 * (4 parts of α) = 2.8 parts of α
The wt.% of A in β phase = 20% of weight of β phase = 0.2 * (1 part of β) = 0.2 parts of β

The total weight of alloy is (4 parts of α) + (1 part of β) = 5 parts.
Total weight of A in the alloy = (2.8 parts of α) + (0.2 parts of β) = 3 parts.

So, X = (3 parts of A) / (5 parts of the alloy) = 0.6 = 60%
Therefore, the wt.% of B in the alloy is 100% - 60% = 40%.

The answer is [40].
