To solve this question, we will use the formula for density:

Density = (mass of unit cell * Avogadro's number) / (volume of unit cell)

First, we need to find the mass of the unit cell. For an Fe-10% C alloy, the mass can be calculated as:

Mass of unit cell = (mass of Fe x number of Fe atoms) + (mass of C x number of C atoms)
                    = (55.8 g/mol x 9 atoms) + (12.0 g/mol x 1 atom)
                    = 502.2 g/mol

Next, we need to find the volume of the unit cell. For an fcc structure, the volume can be calculated as:

Volume of unit cell = (lattice parameter)^3 / 4

Substituting the given values, we get:

Volume of unit cell = (4 Å)^3 / 4
                    = 64 Å^3 / 4
                    = 16 Å^3

Now, we need to convert the volume to cm^3 to match the units of density. Recall that 1 Å = $10^(-8)$ cm. Therefore:

Volume of unit cell = 16 Å^3 x (1 cm / $10^(-8)$ Å)^3
                    = 16 x ($10^(-24)$ cm^3)

Substituting these values into the density formula, we get:

Density = (502.2 g/mol x 6.023 x $10^(23)$) / (16 x $10^(-24)$ cm^3)
        = 7.87 g/cm^3

Rounding off to two decimal places, the density of the austenite is 7.87 g/cm^3.

The final answer is:
- 7.87 g/cm^3
