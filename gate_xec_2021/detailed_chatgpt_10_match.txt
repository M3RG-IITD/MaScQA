Scanning electron microscopy uses electrons to produce images at a higher resolution than light microscopy. Different signals can be obtained from the sample, four of which are listed in Column I:

- Secondary electrons (P): These are low energy electrons generated by the beam-sample interaction that are emitted from the top few nanometers of the sample surface.
- Backscattered electrons (Q): These are high-energy electrons that scatter back from the sample surface depending on the atomic number and density of the material. They are used to obtain topographical and compositional information.
- Characteristic X-rays (R): These are emitted from the sample when inner shell electrons are ejected and outer shell electrons fill the vacancies. They are used for quantitative elemental analysis.
- Diffracted backscattered electrons (S): These are backscattered electrons that have undergone a change in direction due to interacting with the sample crystal lattice. They are used for crystallographic analysis.

Four possible applications for SEM are given in Column II:

- Crystallographic orientation of grains (1): This refers to the arrangement of the atoms within a crystal and how they are oriented with respect to each other. It can be used to determine crystal structure, grain size, and texture.
- Failure analysis of fractured surfaces (2): This includes determining the cause of the failure, the location of the fracture origin, and identifying the fracture mode (e.g. ductile or brittle).
- Chemical composition analysis (3): This involves determining the elemental composition of a sample, either qualitatively or quantitatively.
- Distinguishing chemically distinct phases (4): This refers to identifying different regions of a sample that have different chemical or structural properties.

Based on the above descriptions, we can match the information in Column I with the most appropriate information in Column II as follows:

- P-3: Secondary electrons are used to obtain information about the topography and composition of the sample surface. This can be used for qualitative and quantitative chemical analysis.
- Q-4: Backscattered electrons are used to obtain compositional information and can distinguish regions of the sample that have different atomic number or density. This can be used for identifying different phases.
- R-1: Characteristic X-rays are used for quantitative elemental analysis, which can provide information about the crystal structure and composition of the sample.
- S-2: Diffracted backscattered electrons are used for crystallographic analysis, which can provide information about grain orientation and texture. However, they are not typically used for failure analysis.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) P-2; Q-4; R-1; S-2
