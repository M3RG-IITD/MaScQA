Answer: (B) sampling volume of BSE is larger.

Explanation:

The backscattered electron (BSE) images are generated by detecting high-energy electrons that are scattered back by atoms in the sample. On the other hand, secondary electron (SE) images are generated by detecting low-energy electrons that are emitted from the surface of the sample. 

The resolution of an image is defined as the ability to distinguish two closely spaced objects as separate. In scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the resolution is limited by several factors, including the size of the electron spot, the energy of the electrons used, and the size of the sampling volume. 

In the case of BSE imaging, the sampling volume is larger than that of SE imaging. This is because the high-energy BSEs penetrate deeper into the sample before being backscattered, whereas the low-energy SEs are mostly generated near the surface of the sample. Therefore, the BSE signal is more affected by the bulk properties of the sample, such as composition and density, rather than the surface properties. 

Due to the larger sampling volume of BSE, the resolution of BSE image is poorer compared to that of SE image. Hence, option (B) is the correct answer.
