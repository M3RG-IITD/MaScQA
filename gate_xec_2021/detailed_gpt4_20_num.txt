To find the percentage increase in the volume of graphite when heated from 900 K to 1100 K, we need to determine the volume expansion coefficient, which is given by the sum of the linear expansion coefficients (parallel and perpendicular) and use the relation for percentage increase in volume.

Step 1: Identify the linear thermal expansion coefficients
The linear thermal expansion coefficients are given as:
α_parallel = 0.8 × 10^(-6) K^(-1)
α_perpendicular = 29 × 10^(-6) K^(-1)

Step 2: Find the volume thermal expansion coefficient
The volume thermal expansion coefficient, β, is the sum of the linear thermal expansion coefficients along three axes. Since graphite has layers and the thermal expansion coefficients are given parallel and perpendicular to these layers, we assume that the third direction is also perpendicular to the layers.

β = α_parallel + 2 * α_perpendicular
β = (0.8 × 10^(-6) K^(-1)) + 2 * (29 ×10^(-6) K^(-1))
β = 0.8 × 10^(-6) K^(-1) + 58 × 10^(-6) K^(-1)
β = 58.8 × 10^(-6) K^(-1)

Step 3: Use the percentage increase in volume relation
The percentage increase in volume, ΔV/V, can be found using the relation:

ΔV/V = β * ΔT

where ΔT is the change in temperature.

ΔT = 1100 K - 900 K = 200 K

ΔV/V = 58.8 × 10^(-6) K^(-1) * 200 K
ΔV/V = 11.76 × 10^(-3)

To find the percentage increase in volume, we need to multiply this result by 100.

Percentage increase in volume = ΔV/V * 100
Percentage increase in volume = 11.76 × 10^(-3) * 100
Percentage increase in volume ≈ 1.18% (rounded off to 2 decimal places)

Therefore, the percentage increase in the volume of graphite when heated from 900 K to 1100 K is approximately 1.18%. 

Final answer: [1.18]
