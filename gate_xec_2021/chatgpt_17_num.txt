The volume of a unit cell of hcp Ti can be calculated by considering it to be composed of six tetrahedrons and one octahedron. Thus,

Volume of hcp unit cell = $\frac{6}{12}\times a^3\sqrt{2}$ + $\frac{1}{4}\times \frac{\pi}{3}a^3$

where $a$ is the lattice parameter of hcp Ti.

We know that the density of hcp Ti is 4.51 g $cm^(−3)$ . Thus, the mass of one unit cell can be calculated as:

$m$ = volume of hcp unit cell $\times$ density of hcp Ti

Similarly, the mass of one unit cell of bcc Ti can be calculated using its lattice parameter and atomic weight.

Thus, the percent volume change can be calculated as:

percent volume change = $\frac{m(bcc)-m(hcp)}{m(hcp)}\times100$

Now, let's put in the values given in the problem.

The lattice parameter of bcc Ti is given as 0.332 nm, which is equal to 0.0332 cm.

The atomic weight of Ti is given as 47.9.

The lattice parameter of hcp Ti is given as 0.332 nm.

Density of hcp Ti = 4.51 g $cm^(−3)$.

Using the above equations, we get:

Volume of hcp unit cell = 0.259 $nm^3$ = $2.59\times10^{-23}$ $cm^3$

Mass of one unit cell of hcp Ti = 1.17 $\times$ $10^{-21}$ g

Mass of one unit cell of bcc Ti = 1.63 $\times$ $10^{-21}$ g

percent volume change = $\frac{(1.63-1.17)\times10^{-21}}{1.17\times10^{-21}}\times100 = 39.3$

Rounded off to one decimal place, the percent volume change is 39.3%.

Answer: [39.3]
