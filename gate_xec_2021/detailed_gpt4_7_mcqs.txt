To understand which deposition condition favors the formation of larger grains in thin films, we need to first know about the factors affecting grain growth during the process of thin film deposition.

Grain growth depends on these two factors:

1. Atomic Mobility: The ability of atoms to move and arrange themselves in the thin film. Higher atomic mobility results in larger grains, as the atoms have a greater chance to move around and find suitable positions to form larger grains.

2. Nucleation Rate: The rate at which new grains form within the thin film. Lower nucleation rates lead to larger grains, as fewer grains compete for the available space and growth.

Now, let's evaluate each option based on the impact of deposition rate and substrate temperature on atomic mobility and nucleation rate.

(A) Low deposition rate and low substrate temperature:
- Low deposition rate usually means a slow, steady growth of grains, however, the substrate's low temperature can limit atomic mobility, leading to the development of smaller grains.

(B) Low deposition rate and high substrate temperature:
- Low deposition rate ensures slow grain growth, and high substrate temperature contributes to higher atomic mobility. This combination allows larger grains to form because atoms have a higher chance to migrate and create large grain structures.

(C) High deposition rate and low substrate temperature:
- A high deposition rate can lead to the fast formation of new grains, however, the low substrate temperature still limits atomic mobility, making it difficult for these grains to grow larger in size.

(D) High deposition rate and high substrate temperature:
- Although the high substrate temperature increases atomic mobility, the high deposition rate typically results in the rapid formation of new grains, which compete for available space, potentially impeding the growth of larger grain sizes.

Based on this understanding, the best condition for larger grains in thin films is when both deposition rate is low and substrate temperature is high, which allows for slow grain growth and higher atomic mobility to facilitate the development of large grain structures.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Low deposition rate and high substrate temperature.
