To calculate the percent volume change accompanying the allotropic transformation of Ti from hcp to bcc, we first need to find the volume of the unit cell for both hcp and bcc phases.

1. Calculate the volume of bcc unit cell:
For a bcc unit cell, the volume can be calculated using the lattice parameter (a) as follows: 
Volume = a³

Given, a = 0.332 nm = 0.332 x $10^{-9}$ m
So, Volume of bcc unit cell = (0.332 x $10^{-9}$)³ = $3.656 \times 10^{-29} \ m^3$

2. Calculate the volume of hcp unit cell:
The relationship between the density (ρ), the atomic weight (Mw), the Avogadro's number (N), and the volume of the unit cell (V) can be established by the following formula:
ρ = Mw × N / (V × n),

where n is the number of atoms per unit cell.

For hcp structure, n = 6 (as it has two layers with 3 atoms each)
Given, Mw = 47.9 g/mol; ρ = 4.51 g $cm^{−3}$ = 4.51 x $10^3$ kg $m^{-3}$; Avogadro's number (N) = 6.023 × $10^(23)$,
Now, we can calculate the volume (V) of the hcp unit cell:

V = Mw × N / (ρ × n)
V = (47.9 × 6.023 × $10^{23}$) / (4.51 × $10^3$ × 6) = $2.898 \times 10^{-29} m^3$

3. Calculate the percent volume change:
Percent volume change = [(V_bcc - V_hcp)/V_hcp] × 100

Percent volume change = [($3.656 \times 10^{-29} - 2.898 \times 10^{-29})/2.898 \times 10^{-29}$] × 100
Percent volume change = ($7.58 \times 10^{-30}$ / $2.898 \times 10^{-29}$) × 100 ≈ 26.2%

Therefore, the percent volume change accompanying the allotropic transformation of Ti from hcp to bcc is 26.2%.

Answer: [26.2]
