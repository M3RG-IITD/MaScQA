(Given: 1 atm = 1.01325 × $10^(5)$ Pa). An element transforms from α to β at 773 K and 1 atm pressure with 912 J $mol^(−1)$ as enthalpy of transformation. The molar volumes of α and β phases are 7.377 $cm^3$ and 7.317 $cm^3$ , respectively. Assume that the difference in molar volumes of α and β is independent of pressure. The pressure (in atm) required for α to β transformation to occur at 723 K is (round off to nearest integer)
