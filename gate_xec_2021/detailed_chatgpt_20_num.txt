Given:
Linear thermal expansion coefficient parallel to layers of graphite (α1) = 0.8 * $10^{-6}K^{-1}$
Linear thermal expansion coefficient perpendicular to layers of graphite (α2) = 29 * $10^{-6}K^{-1}$
Initial temperature (T1) = 900 K
Final temperature (T2) = 1100 K

We need to calculate the percentage increase in the volume of graphite.

Let the initial length of graphite be L0, initial width be W0 and initial height be H0. Therefore, initial volume of graphite (V1) = L0 * W0 * H0.

When the temperature is increased from T1 to T2, the change in length parallel to layers is given by ΔL1 = α1 * L0 * ΔT, where ΔT = T2 - T1.

Similarly, the change in length perpendicular to layers is given by ΔL2 = α2 * L0 * ΔT.

The change in volume (ΔV) due to change in length parallel to layers is given by ΔV1 = L0 * W0 * ΔL1.

The change in volume (ΔV) due to change in length perpendicular to layers is given by ΔV2 = L0 * H0 * ΔL2.

The total change in volume is given by ΔV = ΔV1 + ΔV2 = L0 * W0 * ΔL1 + L0 * H0 * ΔL2

Substituting the values, we get:

ΔV = L0 * W0 * α1 * L0 * ΔT + L0 * H0 * α2 * L0 * ΔT

ΔV = L0^2 * ΔT * (W0 * α1 + H0 * α2)

The percentage increase in volume is given by:

Percentage increase in volume = ΔV/V1 * 100%

V1 = L0 * W0 * H0

As ΔT = T2 - T1 = 1100 K - 900 K = 200 K, we get:

ΔV = L0^2 * ΔT * (W0 * α1 + H0 * α2)

V1 = L0 * W0 * H0

Substituting the given values, we get:

ΔV/V1 * 100% = [L0^2 * ΔT * (W0 * α1 + H0 * α2)] / [L0 * W0 * H0] * 100%

ΔV/V1 * 100% = ΔT * (W0 * α1 + H0 * α2) * 100%

ΔV/V1 * 100% = 200 * (0.8 * $10^{-6}$ * 100 + 29 * $10^{-6}$ * 100)%

ΔV/V1 * 100% = 54.8%

Therefore, the percentage increase in the volume of graphite when heated from 900 K to 1100 K is 54.8% (rounded off to 2 decimal places).
