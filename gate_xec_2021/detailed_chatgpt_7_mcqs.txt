The formation of larger grains in thin film depends on the energy of impinging atoms and their mobility on the substrate surface during the growth process. Therefore, the conditions that will favour the formation of larger grains in thin film are those that provide low energy but high mobility of depositing atoms. This can be achieved by:

(A) Low deposition rate and low substrate temperature: In this condition, the low deposition rate provides low energy deposition of atoms, which favours the formation of larger grains. The low substrate temperature also reduces the mobility of atoms, which reduces the chances of nucleation and increases the growth of existing grains.

(B) Low deposition rate and high substrate temperature: In this condition, the low deposition rate provides low energy deposition of atoms, which favours the formation of larger grains. However, the high substrate temperature increases the mobility of atoms, which promotes nucleation and growth of new grains. Therefore, the effect of high substrate temperature on the formation of larger grains is less significant than its effect on nucleation.

(C) High deposition rate and low substrate temperature: In this condition, the high deposition rate provides high energy deposition of atoms, which hinders the formation of larger grains. The low substrate temperature reduces the mobility of atoms, which again reduces the chances of nucleation and increases the growth of existing grains.

(D) High deposition rate and high substrate temperature: In this condition, the high deposition rate provides high energy deposition of atoms, which hinders the formation of larger grains. The high substrate temperature increases the mobility of atoms, which promotes nucleation and growth of new grains. Therefore, the effect of high substrate temperature on the formation of larger grains is less significant than its effect on nucleation.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Low deposition rate and low substrate temperature.
