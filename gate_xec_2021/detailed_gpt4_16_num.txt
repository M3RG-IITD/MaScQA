To determine the weight percentage of element B in the alloy, we will first find the overall weight percentage of element A in the alloy and then subtract it from 100%. 

Step 1: Determine the weight percentage of A in the alloy.
As given, the ratio of weight percentages of α to β is 4. Let's denote the weight percentages of α and β in the alloy as wα and wβ, respectively.

Thus, we have the relation:

wα / wβ = 4

Step 2: Find the expression for overall weight percentage of A in the alloy.
We know the weight percentage of A in α and β phase is 70 and 20, respectively. So, we can write the expression for overall weight percentage of A in the alloy, A_alloy, as:

A_alloy = (wα * 70% + wβ * 20%) / (wα + wβ)

Step 3: Substitute the value of wα or wβ from Step 1 in the expression of A_alloy.
Let's use the relation from Step 1 to eliminate wβ. We have:

wβ = wα / 4

Substituting this into the A_alloy expression, we get:

A_alloy = (wα * 70% + (wα / 4) * 20%) / (wα + (wα / 4))

Step 4: Simplify the expression and solve for A_alloy.
We can simplify the above expression by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by 4 to remove the fraction:

A_alloy = (4 * wα * 70% + wα * 20%) / (4 * wα + wα)

Now, we can factor out wα from both the numerator and the denominator:

A_alloy = (wα(4 * 70% + 20%)) / wα(4 + 1)

Cancel out the wα terms:

A_alloy = (4 * 70% + 20%) / (4 + 1)

Solve for A_alloy:

A_alloy = (280% + 20%) / 5
A_alloy = 300% / 5
A_alloy = 60%

Step 5: Find the weight percentage of B in the alloy.
As we've found the overall weight percentage of A in the alloy, the weight percentage of B in the alloy, B_alloy, can be determined by subtracting A_alloy from 100%:

B_alloy = 100% - A_alloy

B_alloy = 100% - 60%
B_alloy = 40% (rounded to the nearest integer)

So, the weight percentage of element B in the alloy is 40%.

The correct answer is [40].
