The critical size of the solid nucleus is given as 

$r^* = \frac{2\sigma}{\Delta G}$

where $\sigma$ is interfacial energy between solid and liquid, $\Delta G$ is the change in Gibbs free energy on solidification per unit volume.

As the cooling rate is rapid, we can assume that the temperature at which solidification initiates is the same as the undercooling temperature, i.e., 

$\Delta G = \Delta H_{fus}$

where $\Delta H_{fus}$ is the molar enthalpy of fusion.

Thus, 

$r^* = \frac{2\sigma}{\Delta H_{fus}}$

At 600 °C, the metal is completely liquid and there are no solid nuclei present. On cooling rapidly, the nuclei form at undercooling temperatures of 100 °C, 200 °C and 300 °C.

For solidification to occur, the critical size of the solid nucleus should be exceeded. The critical size depends on the undercooling temperature and is given by the above equation.

The interfacial energy between solid and liquid is a constant and does not depend on the undercooling temperature.

Thus, the critical size of the solid nucleus is smaller for solidification at 400 °C as compared to solidification at 500 °C, since the molar enthalpy of fusion is smaller at 400 °C than at 500 °C. The critical size of the solid nucleus will be the smallest for solidification at 300 °C, since the molar enthalpy of fusion is the smallest at this temperature.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

- (B) smaller for solidification at 400 °C as compared to solidification at 500 °C
