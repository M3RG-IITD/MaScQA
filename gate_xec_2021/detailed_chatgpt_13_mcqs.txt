X-ray diffraction peak broadening can be attributed to a number of factors, including crystal size, microstrain, and residual macrostress in the material. However, the most significant factor is generally considered to be crystallite size. When X-rays are diffracted by a crystal, the X-ray beams interact with the atoms in the crystal lattice, and the resulting diffraction pattern is dependent on the spacing of these atoms. The broader the diffraction peaks, the larger the range of crystallite sizes present in the sample. Therefore, option (A) "crystallite size of the material" is the correct answer.

However, it is important to note that microstrain and residual macrostress can also cause peak broadening. Microstrain results from small scale distortions in the crystal lattice, while residual macrostress is caused by forces acting on the crystal from its surroundings. Therefore, while option (A) is the most direct answer to this question, options (B) and (D) are not entirely incorrect. Option (C) is not the best choice as peak broadening is not typically used to determine precise lattice parameters. 

In summary, the correct answer is: 
(A) crystallite size of the material
