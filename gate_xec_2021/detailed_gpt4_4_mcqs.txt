To solve this question, we should understand what each type of polarizability means and how they relate to the dielectric constant of a material.

(A) Dipolar polarizability: This type of polarizability is due to the orientational polarization of molecules that possess a permanent electric dipole moment. When an external electric field is applied, these dipoles rotate or change orientation, leading to polarization. Dipolar polarizability is more significant at lower frequencies, as the dipoles have a chance to rotate and reorient themselves in response to the electric field.

(B) Ionic polarizability: This type of polarizability is related to the displacement of cations and anions in ionic materials in response to an applied electric field. This displacement leads to a net polarization within the material. Ionic polarizability is relevant in the lower frequency range and for materials with a significant ionic character.

(C) Electronic polarizability: This type of polarizability is due to the displacement of electrons in atoms or molecules in response to an applied electric field, which leads to the formation of an induced dipole moment. Electronic polarizability is significant at higher frequencies, such as ultraviolet or optic frequencies, as the electrons can respond rapidly to the oscillating electric field.

(D) Interfacial polarizability: This type of polarizability is attributed to the polarization caused by charge accumulation or surface dipoles at the interface between two different materials or phases. It generally depends on the specific materials and interfaces involved.

Now that we have an understanding of these types of polarizability, we can determine which one is mainly responsible for the dielectric constant in the ultraviolet frequency range.

As mentioned, electronic polarizability (C) is related to high-frequency regions such as ultraviolet frequencies because electrons can respond rapidly to oscillating electric fields. Therefore, the dielectric constant of a material at ultraviolet frequencies is mainly due to electronic polarizability.
