To calculate the density of bcc Ti, we will use the formula:

Density = (mass of 1 atom) / (volume of 1 atomic cell)

For 1 atom, the mass is given by the atomic weight of Ti divided by Avogadro's Number:
Mass of 1 atom = 47.9 g/mol / (6.023 x 10^23 atoms/mol)

Since it is a bcc structure, there are 2 atoms per unit cell, so we must multiply the mass of one atom by 2:
Mass of unit cell = 2 * Mass of 1 atom

Now we need to find the volume of 1 atomic cell of the bcc structure. The lattice parameter of bcc Ti is given as 0.332 nm. The formula for calculating the volume of a cube is side^3. Therefore, the volume of the unit cell in bcc Ti is:
Volume of unit cell = (0.332 nm)^3

Now we can calculate the density of bcc Ti:
Density_bcc = (Mass of unit cell) / (Volume of unit cell)

Let's plug in the known values and calculate the density:
Density_bcc = (2 * 47.9 g/mol) / (6.023 × 10^23 atoms/mol * (0.332 nm)^3)

Density_bcc ≈ 4.75 g/cm³

Now we are given the density of hcp Ti (4.51 g/cm³). We can find the percent volume change during the transformation using the following formula:

Percent Volume Change = |(Density_hcp - Density_bcc) / Density_hcp| * 100

Percent Volume Change = |(4.51 - 4.75) / 4.51| * 100

Percent Volume Change ≈ 5.3 %

Rounded to one decimal place, the percent volume change is [5.3].
