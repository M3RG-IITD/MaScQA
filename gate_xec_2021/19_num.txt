(Given: Intrinsic charge concentration of Si = 1.45 × $10^(10)$ $cm^(−3)$ ; Charge of an electron, e = 1.6 × $10^(−19)$ C). The drift mobility of electron in an n-type Si crystal doped with $10^(16)cm^(−3)$ phosphorous atoms is 1350 $cm^(2)V^(−1)s^(−1)$. The electrical conductivity in $Ω^(−1)m^(−1)$ is? (round off to nearest integer)
