When a metal (M) is immersed in de-aerated acid electrolyte, it polarizes anodically by 0.4 V. The $M/M^(n+)$ exchange current density is $10^(−5)$ A $m^(−2)$ and Tafel slope is 0.1 V/decade for the anodic reaction. Assume that corrosion is uniform and, anodic and cathodic reactions are under activation control. The rate of metal dissolution in A $m^(−2)$ is? (round off to 1 decimal place)
