Unfortunately, I cannot view the image or the options. However, I can provide a general step-by-step explanation of how to analyze the behavior of a co-joined cross-ply laminate upon heating and describe the possible edge deformations.

Step 1: Identify materials and layers
Identify the materials and layers present in the laminate composite. Take note of the plies' orientation, thickness, and material properties. The composite should have alternating layers with fibers oriented in different directions, typically at 0° and 90° (or ±45°) with respect to the loading direction.

Step 2: Analyze thermal stresses
Compute the thermal stresses in each layer. This is typically done using the material's coefficient of thermal expansion and the temperature change. You must also know about the material's mechanical properties, including the moduli of elasticity and Poisson's ratios.

Step 3: Analyze bending and deformation
Use the thermal stress values to analyze how the laminate bends or deforms. Due to the differing material properties and stress values, each layer may expand or contract differently, resulting in overall bending or distortion in the composite.

Step 4: Determine edge shapes
Once you have an understanding of how the individual layers are responding to the thermal stress, model the laminate to determine how the upper and lower faces (edges) will deform. There are multiple ways to determine the deformation depending on the laminate model you are using i.e., classical lamination theory (CLT), finite element method (FEM), etc. Compute the resulting shapes of edges XY and YZ.

The final shapes for the edges are usually a result of the bending curvature and warping because of the mismatch of the expansion between the two layers. 

Finally, compare your calculated edge shapes with the given options (A, B, C, or D). The correct answer would be the one that matches the predicted shapes of edges XY and YZ.

Note: In the absence of the actual image and options, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer or a list.
