To find the intensity of magnetization (I), we can use the following formula:

I = Magnetic moment (M) / Volume (V)

First, we need to find the volume of the magnet. We are given the mass (m) and the density (ρ) of the magnet. We can use the formula:

V = m / ρ

where V is the volume, m is the mass, and ρ is the density.

We are given:

m = 50 g
ρ = 7.2 g/cm³

Plugging in the given values:

V = (50 g) / (7.2 g/cm³)

V = 6.944 cm³

Now we have the volume of the magnet. Next, we can find the intensity of magnetization (I) using the formula:

I = Magnetic moment (M) / Volume (V)

We are given:

Magnetic moment (M) = 4.2 × 10^(-7) Am²
Volume (V) = 6.944 cm³

Before finding I, we need to convert the volume from cm³ to m³. We know that:

1 cm³ = 10^(-6) m³

So,

V = 6.944 cm³ × (10^(-6) m³/cm³)

V = 6.944 × 10^(-6) m³

Now we can find the intensity of magnetization (I):

I = (4.2 × 10^(-7) Am² ) / (6.944 × 10^(-6) m³)

I = 0.00042 / 0.000006944

I ≈ 60.488 Am^(-1)

Rounded off to three decimal places, the intensity of magnetization is:

I ≈ 60.488 Am^(-1)

The final answer is [60.488] Am^(-1).
