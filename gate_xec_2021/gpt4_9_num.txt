To find the intensity of magnetization, we need to divide the magnetic moment by the volume of the magnet. 

First, let's find the volume. 

Density = Mass / Volume
7.2 g/cm³ = 50 g / Volume

Volume = 50 g / 7.2 g/cm³ ≈ 6.9444 cm³

Now, we can find the intensity of magnetization (I). 

I = Magnetic moment / Volume
I = 4.2 × 10^(-7) Am² / 6.9444 cm³

Since 1 cm³ = 1.0 × 10^6 µm³, we have:

I = 4.2 × 10^(-7) Am² / 6.9444 × 10^(-9) m³

I ≈ 60.48 Am^(−1)

Rounding off to 3 decimal places, the answer is:

[60.480]
