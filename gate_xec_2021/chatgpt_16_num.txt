Let the wt.% of A and B in the alloy be x and y, respectively.
Given that the wt.% of A in α and β phases is 70 and 20, respectively.
Therefore, the wt.% of B in α and β phases is 30 and 80, respectively. (since the total wt.% of A and B should add up to 100 in each phase)
Let the total weight of the alloy be 100 grams.
Then, the weight of α phase and β phase will be in the ratio of 4:1. (since the ratio of weight percentages of α to β is 4)
Let the weight of α phase be 4x grams and the weight of β phase be x grams.
Therefore, the weight of A in the α phase = 70% of 4x = 2.8x grams
and the weight of A in the β phase = 20% of x = 0.2x grams
Similarly, the weight of B in the α phase = 30% of 4x = 1.2x grams
and the weight of B in the β phase = 80% of x = 0.8x grams
The total weight of A in the alloy = 2.8x + 0.2x = 3x grams
The total weight of B in the alloy = 1.2x + 0.8x = 2x grams
Therefore, the wt.% of A in the alloy = (3x/100) * 100 = 3x%
and the wt.% of B in the alloy = (2x/100) * 100 = 2x%
Given that the ratio of wt.% of α to β is 4.
Therefore, (wt.% of A in α)/(wt.% of A in β) = 4
(70/30) / (20/80) = 4
Solving, we get 80x = 105
x = 1.313
Therefore, wt.% of B in the alloy is approximately equal to 2x = 2.626, which on rounding off to the nearest integer is equal to 3.
