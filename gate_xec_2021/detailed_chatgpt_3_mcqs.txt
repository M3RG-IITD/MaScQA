We can determine the most favoured slip system in face centered cubic (FCC) metals by considering the ease with which dislocations move in various crystallographic planes and directions. 

In FCC metals, dislocations tend to move along close-packed planes (i.e. those with the highest atomic packing density). The most densely packed planes in FCC metals are the {111} planes. 

Next, we consider the slip direction. The ideal slip direction is one that requires the least amount of energy to move a dislocation. For FCC metals, the <110> directions are the most energetically favourable slip directions. 

Therefore, the slip system with the highest likelihood of being favoured in FCC metals is (111)[110]. 

To verify the answer options given in the question, we can examine each one to see if it matches the (111)[110] slip system:

(A) (111) [110]: This matches the slip system we determined to be most favourable for FCC metals. 
(B) (110) [1 -1 1]: This is a valid slip system in FCC metals, but it does not correspond to the most favoured slip system. 
(C) (1 1 -1) [112]: This is a valid slip system in FCC metals, but it does not correspond to the most favoured slip system. 
(D) (111) [1 -1 0]: This is a valid slip system in FCC metals, but it does not correspond to the most favoured slip system. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) (111) [110].
