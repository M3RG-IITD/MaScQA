We know that at constant temperature and pressure, the Gibbs free energy change is given by:

$\Delta G = \Delta H - T\Delta S$

Where $\Delta H$ is the enthalpy change, $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin, and $\Delta S$ is the entropy change.

At the phase transition from alpha to beta, the Gibbs free energy change is 0. Therefore,

$0 = \Delta H - T\Delta S$

Solving for $\Delta S$, we get:

$\Delta S = \frac{\Delta H}{T}$

Substituting the given values, we get:

$\Delta S = \frac{912\ \text{J}\ \text{mol}^{-1}}{773\ \text{K}} = 1.179\ \text{J K}^{-1}\ \text{mol}^{-1}$

We also know that at the phase transition from alpha to beta, the molar volume changes from $v_\alpha$ to $v_\beta$. Assuming that the difference in molar volumes of alpha and beta is independent of pressure, the work done per mole during the phase transition is:

$w = -P\Delta V = -P(v_\beta - v_\alpha)$

At constant temperature and pressure, the change in Gibbs free energy is equal to the work done by the system. Therefore,

$\Delta G = -P(v_\beta - v_\alpha)$

$\Delta G$ is the same for the phase transition from alpha to beta at both 773 K and 723 K. Therefore,

$-P(v_\beta - v_\alpha) = -P'(v_\beta - v_\alpha)$

$P = P'\frac{v_\beta - v_\alpha}{v_\beta}$

Substituting the given values, we get:

$P = P'\frac{7.317\ \text{cm}^3 - 7.377\ \text{cm}^3}{7.317\ \text{cm}^3} = P'\frac{-0.06\ \text{cm}^3}{7.317\ \text{cm}^3} = -0.00819P'$

From the ideal gas law, we know that:

$PV = nRT$

$P = \frac{nRT}{V}$

Therefore,

$P' = \frac{V}{nRT}$

Substituting the given values, we get:

$P' = \frac{7.377\ \text{cm}^3}{1\ \text{mol}} \cdot \frac{1\ \text{m}^3}{10^6\ \text{cm}^3} \cdot \frac{1\ \text{atm}}{1.01325 \times 10^5\ \text{Pa}} \cdot \frac{1}{0.08206\ \text{L atm K}^{-1}\ \text{mol}^{-1} \cdot 723\ \text{K}} = 0.2967\ \text{atm}^{-1}$

Therefore,

$P = -0.00819 \times 0.2967\ \text{atm}^{-1} = -0.00244\ \text{atm}$

Round off to nearest integer, we get:

$\boxed{0\ \text{atm}}$
