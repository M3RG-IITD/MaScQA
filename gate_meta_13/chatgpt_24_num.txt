The equation relating true stress and true strain is given as: 

σ = 1050 * $ε^{0.25}$

We need to find the maximum true uniform strain that can be imparted to the material.

For true uniform strain, ε = δL/L

Where δL is the change in length and L is the original length.

We know, from the equation of true stress and true strain, that:

σ = K * ε ^n (where K = 1050 and n = 0.25)

We can manipulate this equation to find ε as a function of σ:

ε = (σ / K)^(1/n)

Therefore, for uniform true strain: 

δL/L = (σ / K)^(1/n)

Let us substitute the value of K and n in this equation:

δL/L = (σ / 1050)^(1/0.25)

δL/L = (σ / 1050)^4

We want to find the maximum true uniform strain that can be imparted to the material, which means we need to find the value of δL/L at the point where the material fails. 

For most materials, failure occurs when the true stress reaches the ultimate tensile stress (UTS) value. Therefore, we can assume that the value of σ for failure is equal to UTS. 

Let us assume that the UTS value for this material is 300 MPa (megapascals). 

Therefore, we can find the maximum true uniform strain as:

δL/L = (300/1050)^4

δL/L = 0.046

Therefore, the maximum true uniform strain that can be imparted to the material is 0.046.

Answer:
- 0.046.
