In a crystal, point defects can be described as imperfections such as vacancies and interstitial atoms. The configurational entropy of a system is a measure of the randomness (or disorder) in the system, with higher entropy indicating greater disorder. As the concentration of point defects in a crystal increases, the potential arrangements and configurations of atoms in the crystal also increases, leading to an increase in the configurational entropy. 

To demonstrate this, let's consider a simple, abstracted example of a row of 5 atoms, where 3 of them can have either atom A or atom B, and the remaining two can only have atom A.

Without any point defects, we have only one possible configuration "AAAAA" and the configurational entropy S is zero (as there is no randomness in the system).

Now, let's introduce a point defect in the form of a vacancy, where one of the positions previously occupied by atom A can now be vacant (denoted as an "X"). With a single vacancy, we can have the following configurations:
- AXAAA
- AAXAA
- AAAXA
- AAAAX

There are now 4 possible configurations and increased configurational entropy compared to no point defects.

Furthermore, let's introduce interstitial atoms, specifically allowing atom B to occupy any of the previously empty spaces, leading to the following possible configurations:
- BAAAA
- ABAAA
- AABAA
- AAABA
- AAAAB

Total number of possible configurations: 9

As we can see, with increasing point defects concentration, the amount of configurations and the randomness of the system increases, leading to an increase in the configurational entropy.

Hence, the correct answer is:

(C) increases
