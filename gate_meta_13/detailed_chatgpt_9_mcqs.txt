The relationship between the true stress-true strain curve and the engineering stress-engineering strain curve for a given material is given by:

True stress = Engineering stress x (1 + Engineering strain)

True strain = ln(1 + Engineering strain)

From these equations, it can be seen that the true stress-true strain curve lies above and to the left of the engineering stress-engineering strain curve. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) lies above and to the left.
