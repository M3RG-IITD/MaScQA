Unfortunately, there is no image provided, but we can still explain the concept of amorphous density and how to calculate it.

The density of a polymer sample can be divided into two parts - amorphous density and crystalline density. The total density of a polymer sample is the weighted average of these two densities.

1. Amorphous density (ρa): The density of the polymer in its amorphous (i.e., non-crystalline) regions.
2. Crystalline density (ρc): The density of the polymer in its crystalline regions.
3. Volume fraction of crystallinity (Vc): The volume fraction of crystalline regions in the sample.

To calculate the amorphous density (ρa) of a polymer sample, we can use the following equation:

ρ = ρa * (1 - Vc) + ρc * Vc

where ρ is the total density of the polymer sample.

However, we do not have specific values for the polypropylene samples mentioned in the question. Therefore, we cannot calculate the exact density of totally amorphous polypropylene.

The options provided, (A) 0.64, (B) 0.74, (C) 0.84, and (D) 0.94, could be possible density values of amorphous polypropylene, but without any specific information about the samples or an image, we cannot determine the correct answer.

The best course of action would be to:
1. Referenced image or data about the polymer samples.
2. Use the provided equation with the corresponding values to calculate the amorphous density of the given samples.

The answer with the required specific information would be in the list format. The correct answer would be one of the following:

[A] 0.64
[B] 0.74
[C] 0.84
[D] 0.94
