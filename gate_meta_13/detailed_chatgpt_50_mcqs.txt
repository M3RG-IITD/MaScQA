Given, the integral enthalpy of mixing of liquid (Cu, Zn) solution, $ΔH^(mix)$ = -19250 * $χ_(Cu)$ * $χ_(Zn)$.

Now, we know that the expression for partial molar enthalpy of mixing is given as,

$\Delta h_i^E = \frac{\partial \Delta H^{mix}}{\partial n_i}$ at constant temperature and pressure.

where, $n_i$ = amount of component i.

For the given solution containing Cu and Zn, the partial molar enthalpy of mixing for Cu can be calculated by considering the above expression as,

$\Delta h_{Cu}^E = \frac{\partial \Delta H^{mix}}{\partial n_{Cu}}$ at constant temperature and pressure.

Since $ΔH^(mix)$ = -19250 * $χ_(Cu)$ * $χ_(Zn)$, we can differentiate this expression with respect to $n_{Cu}$ to find $\Delta h_{Cu}^E$.

$\frac{\partial \Delta H^{mix}}{\partial n_{Cu}}$ = $\frac{\partial}{\partial n_{Cu}}$ (-19250 * $χ_(Cu)$ * $χ_(Zn)$)

$\frac{\partial \Delta H^{mix}}{\partial n_{Cu}}$ = -19250 * $χ_(Zn)$ * $\frac{\partial}{\partial n_{Cu}}$ ($χ_(Cu)$)

Now, we know that for a solution containing two components, the mole fraction of component i is given as,

$χ_i = \frac{n_i}{n_{Cu}+n_{Zn}}$

On differentiating this expression with respect to $n_{Cu}$, we get,

$\frac{\partial χ_i}{\partial n_{Cu}}$ = $\frac{-n_i}{(n_{Cu}+n_{Zn})^2}$

Substituting this expression in the above equation for $\frac{\partial \Delta H^{mix}}{\partial n_{Cu}}$, we get

$\frac{\partial \Delta H^{mix}}{\partial n_{Cu}}$ = -19250 * $χ_(Zn)$ * $\frac{\partial χ_{Cu}}{\partial n_{Cu}}$

$\frac{\partial \Delta H^{mix}}{\partial n_{Cu}}$ = -19250 * $χ_(Zn)$ * $\frac{-n_{Cu}}{(n_{Cu}+n_{Zn})^2}$

Simplifying the above expression, we get

$\frac{\partial \Delta H^{mix}}{\partial n_{Cu}}$ = $\frac{19250χ_{Cu}χ_{Zn}}{(n_{Cu}+n_{Zn})^2}$

Therefore, the partial molar enthalpy of mixing for Cu is given as,

$\Delta h_{Cu}^E = \frac{19250χ_{Cu}χ_{Zn}}{(n_{Cu}+n_{Zn})^2}$

Now, using the relation $χ_{Zn} = 1 - χ_{Cu}$, we get

$\Delta h_{Cu}^E = \frac{19250χ_{Cu}(1-χ_{Cu})}{(n_{Cu}+n_{Zn})^2}$

Multiplying and dividing by 4, we get

$\Delta h_{Cu}^E = \frac{38500χ_{Cu}(1-χ_{Cu})}{4(n_{Cu}+n_{Zn})^2}$

Therefore, the correct answer is option (C) 38500*$χ_(Zn)$ -19250 * $(χ_(Zn))^2 - 19250$.
