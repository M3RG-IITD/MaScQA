The aperture size of a sieve is the distance between adjacent wires. 

To calculate the aperture size, we need to subtract the wire diameter from the distance between adjacent wires. 

The distance between adjacent wires of a 200 mesh sieve is given as 75 µm (standard value).

Therefore, the aperture size will be:

Aperture size = distance between adjacent wires - wire diameter
Aperture size = 75 µm - 53 µm
Aperture size = 22 µm

Therefore, the aperture size of the 200 mesh sieve having a wire diameter of 53 µm is 22 µm.

Answer: [22 µm]
