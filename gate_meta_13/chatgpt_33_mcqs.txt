We can assume that the relationship between the yield strength and grain size can be described by the Hall-Petch relationship:

σ_y = σ_o + k_d^(-1/2)

where σ_y is the yield strength, σ_o is the intrinsic (or base) yield strength, d is the grain size, k is a material constant, and the exponent (-1/2) is the Hall-Petch slope.

We can use the given data to find the material constant:

100 MPa = σ_o + k_(64 µm)^(-1/2)
145 MPa = σ_o + k_(25 µm)^(-1/2)

Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:

45 MPa = k_(25 µm)^(-1/2) - k_(64 µm)^(-1/2)

Squaring both sides and isolating k, we get:

k = [45 MPa / (1 / 25 µm)^(-1/2) - (1 / 64 µm)^(-1/2)]^2 ≈ 1.353 MPa·µm^(1/2)

Now we can use this constant to find the yield strength for a grain size of 36 µm:

σ_y = σ_o + k_d^(-1/2) = 100 MPa + 1.353 MPa·µm^(1/2)·(36 µm)^(-1/2) ≈ 125.4 MPa

Therefore, the answer is (B) 125.
