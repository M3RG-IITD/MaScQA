G-P zones in Al-Cu alloys are semi-coherent.

Here's a detailed explanation:
- G-P zones are Cu-rich clusters that form during the aging process of Al-Cu alloys. They are important because they contribute to the strengthening of the alloy.
- Semi-coherent interfaces occur when there is some degree of lattice mismatch between the two phases, but there is still some degree of coherence at the interface. This means that there is some degree of atom registry between the phases, but there are also some misfit dislocations that accommodate the lattice mismatch.
- Incoherent interfaces occur when there is a significant lattice mismatch between the two phases and there is no atom registry at the interface. This means that there are no coherent regions at the interface, and the interface is characterized by a high density of misfit dislocations.
- Chemically indistinguishable interfaces occur when the two phases have the same crystal structure and there is no chemical segregation at the interface.

In the case of Al-Cu alloys, the G-P zones are semi-coherent because there is a lattice mismatch between the Al matrix and the Cu-rich clusters, but there is still some degree of coherence at the interface. This coherence is due to the fact that both Al and Cu have a face-centered cubic crystal structure, and there is some degree of atom registry between the two phases. However, there are also misfit dislocations that accommodate the lattice mismatch and allow for the semi-coherent interface to form. Therefore, the answer is (C) semi-coherent.
