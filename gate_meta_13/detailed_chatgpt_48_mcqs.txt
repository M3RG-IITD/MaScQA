To solve this problem we make use of the equation for carbon diffusion in austenite: 

$$\frac{dC}{dt} = \frac{D_{o}}{N_{\text{m}}^2} \cdot \exp{\left(\frac{-Q}{RT}\right)} \cdot \frac{d^2C}{dx^2}$$

where $C$ is the carbon concentration, $t$ is time, $D_{o}$ is the diffusion coefficient, $N_{\text{m}}$ is the number of sites available for diffusion (which is related to the lattice parameter), $Q$ is activation energy, $R$ is the gas constant, and $x$ is the distance from the surface of the specimen.

For simplicity, we assume that the concentration profile remains constant for the duration of the carburizing process, and that the carburizing atmosphere maintains a constant carbon concentration of 1.2 wt.% C at the surface of the specimen. Thus, the initial and boundary conditions are:

$C(x,0) = 0.002$ (initial composition) 

$C(0,t) = 0.012$ (surface composition) 

$C(\infty,t) = 0.002$ (bulk composition)

We can use the complementary error function, $\text{erfc}(x)$, to solve for the concentration profile as a function of depth and time. The solution is: 

$$C(x,t) = C_{o} + (C_{s} - C_{o}) \cdot \text{erfc} \left(\frac{x}{2\sqrt{Dt}}\right)$$

where $C_{o}$ is the initial concentration, $C_{s}$ is the surface concentration, and $D$ is the diffusion coefficient. 

We want to find the depth at which a composition of 0.4 wt.% C is obtained after carburizing at 870°C for 10 h. We can use the concentration profile equation to solve for the depth $x$:

$$C(x,t) = 0.004 = C_{o} + (C_{s} - C_{o}) \cdot \text{erfc} \left(\frac{x}{2\sqrt{Dt}}\right)$$

Plugging in the given constants: 

- $C_{o} = 0.002$
- $C_{s} = 0.012$
- $D = 2.0 \cdot 10^{-5} \text{ m}^2/\text{s}$
- $t = 10 \text{ h} = 36000 \text{ s}$ (note that we need to convert hours to seconds)
- $Q = 142 \text{ kJ/mol}$
- $R = 8.314 \text{ J/mol$\cdot$K}$
- $T = 870 \text{ K}$

we can rearrange the equation to solve for $x$: 

$$x = 2\sqrt{Dt} \cdot \text{erfc}^{-1}\left(\frac{C_{s} - C_{x}}{C_{s} - C_{o}}\right)$$

where $C_{x}$ is the concentration at a depth $x$. Rearranging again: 

$$x = 2\sqrt{Dt} \cdot \text{erf}\left(\frac{C_{s} - C_{x}}{C_{s} - C_{o}}\right)^{-1}$$

We want to find the depth at which $C_{x} = 0.004$ and $C_{s} = 0.012$. Plugging these values into the equation: 

$$x = 2\sqrt{Dt} \cdot \text{erf}\left(\frac{0.008}{0.01}\right)^{-1} \approx 84 \text{ µm}$$

Therefore, the answer is (B) 84 µm.
