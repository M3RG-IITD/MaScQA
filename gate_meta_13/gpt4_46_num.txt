We can find the critical internal crack length using the formula:

$K_(1c) = σ * √(π*a)$

Where $K_(1c)$ is the critical stress intensity factor, $σ$ is the Mode-I stress, and $a$ is the crack length. We want to find the crack length ($a$), so we can rearrange the formula to solve for $a$:

$a = (K_(1c) / (σ * √π))^2$

Now, let's plug in the values we have:

$K_(1c) = 45$ MPa√m $= 45000$ N/mm√m.
$σ = 400$ MPa $= 400000$ N/mm².

$a = (45000 / (400000 * √π))^2$

Now, we can solve for $a$:

$a ≈ 0.000796$ mm²

So, the critical internal crack length is approximately 0.000796 mm².

Answer: [0.000796]
