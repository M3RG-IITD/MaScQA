The Burgers vector is a measure of the lattice distortion caused by a dislocation in a crystal lattice. For an edge dislocation in Î±-Fe, the Burgers vector is equal to one atomic diameter. So, the modulus of the Burgers vector in this case is equal to the atomic diameter of the iron atom, which is 0.25 nm. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 0.25. 

Answer: [0.25]
