We can assume that the relationship between yield strength (YS) and grain size (d) is of the form:

YS = k / dn

Where k and n are constants for a given material. 

We can solve for k and n using the data provided:

100 = k / (64)^n
145 = k / (25)^n

Dividing the second equation by the first, we get:

145/100 = [(k / (25)^n)] / [(k / (64)^n)]

Simplifying, we get:

(145/100) = (64/25)^n

Taking the logarithm of both sides, we get:

n = log(145/100) / log(64/25) = 0.611

Substituting this value of n in one of the equations above, we can solve for k:

100 = k / (64)^0.611

k = 100 x (64)^0.611 = 192.5

Now we can use this relationship to find the yield strength for a grain size of 36 Âµm:

YS = 192.5 / (36)^0.611 = 128.3 MPa

Rounding off to the nearest integer, the answer is (B) 125.
