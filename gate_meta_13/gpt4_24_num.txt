To find the maximum true uniform strain, we need to find the maximum value of ε for the given stress-strain relationship.

Given, σ = 1050 * ε^(0.25)

First, let's differentiate σ with respect to ε:

dσ/dε = 1050 * 0.25 * ε^(-0.75)

Now, to find the maximum or minimum, we need to set the derivative equal to zero and solve for ε:

dσ/dε = 0
1050 * 0.25 * ε^(-0.75) = 0

From this equation, we can see that ε should be non-zero. Therefore, we can divide both sides by 1050 * 0.25:

ε^(-0.75) = 0

Now, taking the reciprocal of both sides:

ε^(0.75) = ∞

This means that there is no maximum true uniform strain that can be imparted to the material based on the given stress-strain equation.
