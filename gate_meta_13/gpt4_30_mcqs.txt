In an FCC (face-centered cubic) crystal lattice, the first two peaks in the X-ray diffraction pattern correspond to the diffraction planes (111) and (200), respectively.

The interplanar spacing for a given set of crystal planes with Miller indices (h, k, l) can be expressed as:

d_hkl = a / sqrt(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)

Where a is the lattice constant.

For the first peak, the spacing is:

d_111 = a / sqrt(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) = a / sqrt(3)

For the second peak, the spacing is:

d_200 = a / sqrt(2^2 + 0^2 + 0^2) = a / sqrt(4) = a / 2

We can find the ratio of d_111 to d_200 by dividing the two equations:

(d_111) / (d_200) = (a / sqrt(3)) / (a / 2)

The lattice constant (a) cancels out, leaving:

R = sqrt(3) / 2 = 1.73 / 2 = 0.866

Since R is the ratio of d_111 to d_200, the inverse of R is the ratio of d_200 to d_111:

1/R = 1 / 0.866 = 1.1547

Now, let's compare this with the given options:

(A) 1.91 
(B) 1.63 
(C) 1.41 
(D) 1.15

The closest option to our calculated value is (D) 1.15. Therefore, the correct answer is:

[(D) 1.15]
