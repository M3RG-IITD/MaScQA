The general expression for the enthalpy of mixing of two liquids is given by $ΔH^(mix)$ = $RT$x$_1$x$_2$($1-x_2$), where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, x$_1$ and x$_2$ are the mole fractions of the two components. In this case, we are given an approximation for $ΔH^(mix)$ as -19250 * $χ_(Cu)$ * $χ_(Zn)$. We can equate the two expressions to derive the solution parameter:

-19250 * $χ_(Cu)$ * $χ_(Zn)$ = $RT$x$_1$x$_2$($1-x_2$)

Since the given expression assumes ideal/non-ideal condition we consider 'regular theory":

Let x$_2$ = $χ_(Zn)$ and x$_1$ = $1- χ_(Zn)$ which gives:

-19250 * $χ_(Cu)$*$χ_(Zn)$ = $RT$(1-$χ_(Zn)$) $χ_(Zn)$($1- χ_(Zn)$)

Simplify the equation:

-19250 * $χ_(Cu)$*$χ_(Zn)$ = $RT$($χ_(Zn)$- $χ_(Zn)^2$)($1- χ_(Zn)$)

-19250 * $χ_(Cu)$ = $RT$(1-$χ_(Zn)$)

Divide throughout with (1-$χ_(Zn)$):

-19250 * $χ_(Cu)$/(1-$χ_(Zn)$) = $RT$

Solution Parameter = -19250/(1-$χ_(Zn)$) J/mol

Option B: -9625 J/mol

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) -9625.
