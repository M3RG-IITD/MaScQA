To find the depth (in µm) from the surface of the specimen at which a composition of 0.4 wt.% C is obtained after carburizing at 870°C for 10 h, we first need to find the diffusion coefficient (D) using the following equation:

D = $D_o$ * exp(-Q / (R * T))

where;
D = diffusion coefficient
$D_o$ = pre-exponential factor (given as 2.0 * $10^{-5} m^2/s$)
Q = activation energy for diffusion (given as 142 kJ/mol = 142 * 10^3 J/mol)
R = gas constant (8.314 J/mol-K)
T = temperature in Kelvin (870°C = 1143 K)

D = (2.0 * $10^{-5}$) * exp(-142 * $10^3$ / (8.314 * 1143))
D ≈ 1.68 * $10^{-10} m^2/s$

Now, we can use Fick's Second Law of Diffusion to determine the depth (x) from the surface of the specimen:

C - $C_s$ = (C_o - $C_s$) * (1 - erf(x / (2 * (Dt)^(1/2))))

where;
C = desired carbon content at depth x (0.4 wt.%)
$C_s$ = carbon content at the surface (1.2 wt.%)
C_o = initial carbon content (0.2 wt.%)
erf = error function
t = time (10 h = 36000 s)

0.4 - 1.2 = (0.2 - 1.2) * (1 - erf(x / (2 * (1.68 * $10^{-10}$ * 36000)^(1/2))))
0.8 = 1 - erf(x / (0.0000267))
erf(x / 0.0000267) = 0.2
x / 0.0000267 = erf^(-1)(0.2)
x ≈ 0.000084 m
x ≈ 84 µm

So the depth (in µm) from the surface of the specimen at which a composition of 0.4 wt.% C is obtained after carburizing at 870°C for 10 h is approximately 84 µm. The correct answer is (B) 84.
