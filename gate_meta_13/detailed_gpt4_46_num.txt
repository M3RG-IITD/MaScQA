To find the critical internal crack length in a steel, we can use the formula for the stress intensity factor for Mode-I stress:

$K_I = σ√(πa)$

Where:
- $K_I$ is the stress intensity factor for Mode-I stress (MPa√m)
- $σ$ is the applied stress (MPa)
- $a$ is the crack length (m)

We are given the critical stress intensity factor ($K_(1c)$) as 45 MPa√m, and the applied stress $σ$ is 400 MPa. We can rearrange the formula to find the crack length $a$:

$a = (K_I / (σ√π))^2$

Plugging in the given values:

$a = ((45\,\text{MPa√m}) / (400\,\text{MPa}√π))^2$

Note that we need to convert the crack length $a$ from meters to millimeters. There are 1000 millimeters in a meter, so we can write the conversion as:

$a_{mm} = a * 1000$

$a_{mm} = (((45\,\text{MPa√m}) / (400\,\text{MPa}√π))^2) * 1000$

Now, we can plug in the values and compute the critical internal crack length:

$a_{mm} = (((45 / (400√π))^2)* 1000$

$a_{mm} \approx 1.2727\,\text{mm}$

So, the critical internal crack length is approximately 1.2727 mm.

The correct answer is [1.2727].
