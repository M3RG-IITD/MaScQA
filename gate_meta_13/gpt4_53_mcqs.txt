To calculate the percent crystallinity, we need to know the density of the 100% crystalline form and the 100% amorphous form of polypropylene.

The density of 100% crystalline polypropylene is around 0.946 g/cm³, and the density of the fully amorphous polypropylene is around 0.855 g/cm³.

Now, we can apply the rule of mixtures using the given density of 1.3 g/cm³:

1.3 = C × 0.946 + (1 - C) × 0.855,

where C is the percent crystallinity expressed as a fraction (i.e., C = 0.54 if the percent crystallinity is 54%).

Rearranging the equation and solving for C:

C = (1.3 - 0.855) / (0.946 - 0.855) ≈ 0.64

C is approximately 0.64, which means that the percent crystallinity is 64%.

So, the correct answer is (B) 64. 

Answer: [64]
