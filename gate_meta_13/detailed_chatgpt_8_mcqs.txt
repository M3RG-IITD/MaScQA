To solve this question, we need to understand the phase diagram of plain carbon steel. 

At 0.2 wt.% carbon concentration, the inter-critical region is the temperature range between the upper and lower critical points, as shown in the phase diagram below:

In the inter-critical region, the steel consists of a mixture of ferrite and austenite. 

When this steel is quenched in water, the austenite transforms into martensite due to the rapid cooling rate. The ferrite, being a relatively stable phase, remains unchanged. 

Therefore, the microstructure of the quenched steel sheet consists of fully martensite, and the correct answer is (A). 

Note: Proeutectoid ferrite + martensite microstructure is formed when a hypo-eutectoid steel is cooled from austenite region at a rate that misses the nose of the TTT diagram and passes through the two-phase region. On the other hand, martensite + pearlite microstructure is formed when hyper-eutectoid steel is cooled from austenite region at a rate that misses the nose of the TTT diagram and passes through the two-phase region.
