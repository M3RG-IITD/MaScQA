To determine the aperture size of a 200 mesh sieve with a wire diameter of 53 µm, we need to use the following formula:

Aperture Size = (W + D) / M

Where:
- Aperture Size is the size of the openings between the wires in the mesh sieve (in µm) that we need to find
- W is the wire diameter (in µm), which is given as 53 µm
- D is the distance between the center of the wires (in µm), which we need to calculate
- M is the mesh count (number of openings per linear inch), which is given as 200

First, let's calculate the distance (D) between the center of the wires:

Since there are 200 openings per linear inch, we need 201 wires for a complete inch. To convert this linear inch into micrometers (µm), we need to know that 1 inch = 25400 µm.

Total length (T) occupied by 201 wires, including the 200 openings and the diameter of the 201 wires, is equal to 1 inch or 25400 µm:

T = (200 * D) + (201 * W)

Now, we need to find D. Rearrange the equation to get D:

D = (T - (201 * W)) / 200

Substitute the values:

D = (25400 - (201 * 53)) / 200
D = (25400 - 10653) / 200
D = 14747 / 200
D ≈ 73.735 µm

Now that we have the distance (D), we can calculate the Aperture Size using the formula mentioned earlier:

Aperture Size = (W + D) / M
Aperture Size = (53 + 73.735) / 200
Aperture Size ≈ 126.735 / 200
Aperture Size ≈ 0.633675 µm

So, the aperture size of the 200 mesh sieve with a wire diameter of 53 µm is approximately 0.633675 µm.

Answer: [0.633675]
