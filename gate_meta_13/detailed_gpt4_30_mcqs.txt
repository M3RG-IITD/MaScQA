To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the interplanar spacing (d-spacing) and the diffraction pattern in an FCC metal.

1. For an FCC lattice, the X-ray diffraction pattern is governed by Bragg's law:

nλ = 2d sin(θ)

where n is an integer representing the order of diffraction, λ is the wavelength of X-rays, d is the interplanar spacing, and θ is the angle of incidence (also known as the Bragg angle).

2. The interplanar spacing for an FCC lattice is given by the following formula:

d = a / √(h² + k² + l²)

where a is the lattice constant, and (h, k, l) are the Miller indices of the plane of interest.

3. For an FCC lattice, the Miller indices (h, k, l) must satisfy the condition that the sum h + k + l is even. This is because only certain planes will give constructive interference in an FCC lattice.

For the first diffraction peak in an FCC structure, the Miller indices giving the lowest (h² + k² + l²) values are (1, 1, 1). So, we have:
d₁ = a / √(1² + 1² + 1²)

d₁ = a / √3

For the second diffraction peak, the Miller indices giving the next lowest (h² + k² + l²) values are (2, 0, 0). So, we have:

d₂ = a / √(2² + 0² + 0²)

d₂ = a / √4

d₂ = a / 2

4. Now, we need to find the ratio of the interplanar spacing obtained from these two peaks:

d₁/d₂ = (a/√3) / (a/2)

To find the ratio, we just divide the two expressions:

(a/√3) / (a/2) = (a/√3) * (2/a) = 2/√3

To simplify the ratio, we can rationalize the denominator:

2/√3 * (√3/√3) = 2√3 / 3

Now, let's compare this ratio to the given options:

(A) 1.91
(B) 1.63
(C) 1.41
(D) 1.15

The value of 2√3 / 3 is approximately 1.15.

So, the correct answer is (D) 1.15.
