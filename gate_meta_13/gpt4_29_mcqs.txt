The packing density of a plane is given by the ratio of the area occupied by the atoms on the plane to the total area of the plane.

In a unit cell, the atoms at the corners are shared by eight neighboring unit cells, while the atoms at the center of the corresponding faces are shared by two neighboring unit cells. Therefore, for each face-centered unit cell, the contribution of each corner atom is 1/8, and the contribution of each face-centered atom is 1/2.

For the (100) plane, which is perpendicular to the x-axis, there are four corner atoms and one face-centered atom. The contribution of the corner atoms is 4*(1/8) = 1/2, and the contribution of the face-centered atom is 1/2. So the total packing density in the (100) plane is 1/2 + 1/2 = 1.

However, we are given that the maximum linear density is along the [110] direction. The linear density is higher along [110] than along [100], so the packing density of the (100) plane must be less than 1.

Of the given options, 0.91 is the closest to 1, so it is the correct answer.

So, the correct answer is [0.91].
