Assuming that the solution behaves regularly, we can use regular solution theory to relate the integral enthalpy of mixing to the solution parameter. 

The regular solution theory suggests that the change in enthalpy upon mixing two liquids is related to the interaction between the molecules of the two liquids. If the interaction between the molecules is similar in both pure liquids and in the mixture, the solution will behave regularly.

The regular solution theory equation for the integral enthalpy of mixing is:

$ΔH_(mix) = x_1x_2 \Delta H_(12)$

where $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the mole fractions of the two components of the mixture, and $\Delta H_(12)$ is the interaction parameter.

Comparing this equation with the given equation, we can see that:

$ΔH_(mix) = -19250 x_(Cu) x_(Zn) = x_1x_2 \Delta H_(12)$

so we can equate the two expressions and solve for the solution parameter:

$\Delta H_(12) = -19250$ J/mol

Therefore, the solution parameter is (A) -19250.
