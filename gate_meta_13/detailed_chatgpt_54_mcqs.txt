In materials science, a dislocation is a crystallographic defect or irregularity within a crystal structure. An edge dislocation is created by inserting an extra half-plane of atoms into a crystal structure. A Burger's vector describes this extra half-plane. 

The modulus of the burgers vector (b) can be calculated using the below formula

b = a/√2

where
a = the atomic distance along the close-packed direction

In the case of α-Fe (Body-centered cubic), we consider the burgers vector along <100> direction.  The atomic distance (a) in iron is given as follows 

a = d/√2

where
d = the atomic diameter = 0.25 nm

a = 0.25/√2 = 0.177 nm

Therefore, the burgers vector in α-Fe is given by

b = a/√2 = 0.177/√2 = 0.125 nm

The correct answer is (A) 0.125.
