First, we need to determine the reduction potential for the given reaction. 

The reaction is: Sn + $2H^(+)$  =  $Sn^(2+)$ + $H_2$

The Nernst equation for the reduction potential of this reaction is given by:

$E=E°-(\dfrac{RT}{nF})\times \log \dfrac {([Sn^{2+}][H_2])}{([Sn](1)[H^+])}$

where E° is the standard reduction potential, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol-K), T is the temperature (298 K), n is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction (2), F is the Faraday constant (96485 C/mol) and [ ] denote concentrations.

We have the following given values:
- E° = -0.136 V
- [Sn] = 1 (because for solid concentrations are taken 1)
- [$H^+$] = $10^{-5}$ (pH = 5, so the concentration of $H^+$ ions is $10^{-5}$ M)
- [$Sn^{2+}$] = $10^{-2}$ M
- $p_(H_2)$ = 1 atm

To find the concentration of $H_2$, we can use the ideal gas law equation: $PV=nRT$

Since we are dealing with a standard potential, we can assume that the concentration of $H_2$ is at standard conditions (1 atm). Thus, [H_2] = 1 M.

Now, we can plug in the given values into the Nernst equation:

$E=-0.136-(\dfrac{8.314×298}{2×96485})\times \log \dfrac {(1) (10^{-2})}{(1)(10^{-5})}$

$E=-0.136-(\dfrac{0.0429}{2}) \times \log 1000$

$E=-0.136 - (\dfrac{0.0429}{2}) \times 3$

$E=-0.136 - 0.06435$

$E=-0.20035$

Now, we need to compare the calculated potential with the standard reduction potential. 

The standard reduction potential represents the potential at which the reaction is in equilibrium. If the calculated potential is more negative than the standard reduction potential, the reaction will proceed in the forward direction, and Sn will undergo oxidation. On the other hand, if the calculated potential is less negative, the reaction will proceed in the backward direction, meaning Sn will undergo reduction.

Since the calculated potential (-0.20035 V) is more negative than the standard reduction potential (-0.136 V), the reaction will proceed in the forward direction, and Sn will undergo oxidation. This means that option A, Sn undergoes oxidation, is true.

Therefore, the correct answer is [A].
