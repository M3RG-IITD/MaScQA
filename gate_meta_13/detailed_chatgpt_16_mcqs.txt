Step 1: Understanding the Blast Furnace Operation

Before diving into the answer options, it's important to understand the blast furnace operation and its basic principles. The blast furnace is a highly controlled reaction vessel where iron ore is reduced to iron metal. The furnace operates at high temperatures and pressures to promote the desired reactions. The iron ore is fed into the top of the blast furnace along with coke (a source of carbon) and limestone (which helps remove impurities).

Step 2: Understanding High Top Pressure

In the context of blast furnace operation, high top pressure refers to an increase in the pressure inside the top of the furnace. This can be caused by factors such as high gas flow rates or blockages in the furnace.

Step 3: Analyzing the Answer Options

(A) Favours the solution-loss reaction: The solution-loss reaction occurs when molten iron dissolves in the slag and is carried out of the furnace. This is an undesirable reaction because it reduces the amount of iron produced. High top pressure would not favor this reaction because it would decrease the amount of contact time between the gas and the solids, reducing the amount of iron that dissolves in the slag. Therefore, option (A) is incorrect.

(B) Suppresses the solution-loss reaction: As explained above, high top pressure would decrease the amount of contact time between the gas and solids in the furnace. This would result in less iron dissolving in the slag, which would decrease the solution-loss reaction. Therefore, option (B) is correct.

(C) Decreases gas-solid contact time: This option is partially correct as high top pressure would decrease gas-solid contact time. This is because the increased pressure would cause the gas flow rate to increase, reducing the amount of time the gas spends in contact with the solids. However, this is not necessarily a negative effect as it can also help remove impurities from the iron. Therefore, option (C) is incorrect.

(D) Increases coke rate: Coke is a source of carbon that is required for the reduction of iron in the blast furnace. However, high top pressure would not directly increase the coke rate. Therefore, option (D) is incorrect.

Step 4: Writing the Answer

Based on the analysis above, the correct answer is (B) suppresses the solution-loss reaction.
