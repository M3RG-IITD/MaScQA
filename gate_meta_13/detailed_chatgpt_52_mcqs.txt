Unfortunately, the image that was mentioned in the question is missing. However, there is a way to solve the question without it, using some basic knowledge about the density and crystallinity of polymers.

Polypropylene (PP) is a semi-crystalline polymer, which means that it has both amorphous and crystalline regions in its structure. The degree of crystallinity of a polymer is defined as the fraction of the material's volume that is occupied by ordered or crystalline regions. Density, on the other hand, is defined as the mass of a substance per unit volume, and it is related to the degree of crystallinity in polymers.

For a given polymer, the density of the totally amorphous state (i.e., with 0% crystallinity) can be calculated by using the density of the fully crystalline state (i.e., the theoretical maximum density) and the degree of crystallinity, as follows:

ρ_am = ρ_c + (1-χ) x (ρ_a - ρ_c)

where:
- ρ_am is the density of the totally amorphous state
- ρ_c is the density of the fully crystalline state
- ρ_a is the density of the fully amorphous state (i.e., with 100% amorphousness)
- χ is the degree of crystallinity, expressed as a decimal (e.g., 0.5 for 50% crystallinity)

The value of ρ_c for PP is typically around 0.97 g/cm3, while the value of ρ_a is around 0.855 g/cm3. Therefore, we can use these values, along with the degree of crystallinity for the two samples, to calculate the density of the totally amorphous state for each sample.

Let's assume that the degree of crystallinity for Sample 1 is 0.4 (i.e., 40% crystallinity), and the degree of crystallinity for Sample 2 is 0.6 (i.e., 60% crystallinity). Then, we can calculate the density of the totally amorphous state for each sample as follows:

For Sample 1:
ρ_am = 0.97 + (1-0.4) x (0.855 - 0.97) = 0.97 - 0.066 = 0.904 g/cm3

For Sample 2:
ρ_am = 0.97 + (1-0.6) x (0.855 - 0.97) = 0.97 - 0.042 = 0.928 g/cm3

Therefore, the answer to the question is:

- The density of totally amorphous polypropylene is 0.904 g/cm3 for Sample 1
- The density of totally amorphous polypropylene is 0.928 g/cm3 for Sample 2

In the absence of the image, it is not possible to choose any of the options (A), (B), (C), or (D).
