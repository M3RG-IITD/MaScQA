To solve this problem, we will use Fick's second law of diffusion, which describes the change in concentration over time and position:

$$\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} = D \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial x^2}$$

In this specific case, we have an error function (erf) solution for the concentration profile, which is given by:

$$C(x, t) = C_s + (C_o - C_s) erf \left( \frac{x}{2 \sqrt{D t}} \right)$$

Where:
- $C(x, t)$ is the carbon concentration as a function of position $x$ and time $t$
- $C_s$ is the carbon concentration at the surface
- $C_o$ is the initial carbon concentration
- $D$ is the diffusion coefficient

First, let's determine the diffusion coefficient at 870°C. We know that the activation energy for diffusion is 142 kJ/mol, and the pre-exponential factor, $D_o$, is 2.0 * $10^(-5) m^2/s$. We can find the diffusion coefficient, $D$, at a given temperature using the Arrhenius equation:

$$D = D_o e^{-Q/RT}$$

Where:
- $R$ is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol⋅K)
- $T$ is the absolute temperature in Kelvin (870°C = 1143K)

$$D = 2.0 × 10^{-5} \text{m}^2/\text{s} \times e^{-\frac{142,000\,\text{J/mol}}{8.314\,\text{J/(mol⋅K)} × 1143\,\text{K}}} = 4.23 × 10^{-11}\,\text{m}^2/\text{s}$$

Now that we have the diffusion coefficient at 870°C, we can solve for the depth $x$ at which a composition of 0.4 wt.% C is obtained after carburizing for 10 h:

We have:

- $C(x,10\,\text{h} = 36000\,\text{s}) = 0.4\%$
- $C_s = 1.2\%$
- $C_o = 0.2\%$

From the given equation, we have:

$$0.004 = 0.012 + (0.002 - 0.012) \text{erf} \left( \frac{x}{2 \sqrt{4.23 × 10^{-11} × 36000}} \right)$$

Solving for $x$:

$$\text{erf} \left(\frac{x}{2\sqrt{4.23 × 10^{-11} × 36000}} \right) = \frac{0.004 - 0.012}{0.002 - 0.012} = -0.8333$$

In order to solve for $x$, we need to find the inverse error function of -0.8333, $\text{erf}^{-1}(-0.8333)$:

$$\text{erf}^{-1}(-0.8333) ≈ -0.9448$$

Now, we can find $x$:

$$x = 2\sqrt{4.23 × 10^{-11} × 36000}\, × (-0.9448)$$

$$x = 8.407 × 10^{-5}\,\text{m}$$

$$x = 84.07\,\mu\text{m}$$

Thus the correct answer is (B) 84 µm.
