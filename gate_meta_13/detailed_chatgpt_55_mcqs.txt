The energy of the edge dislocation can be calculated using the formula:

$E = \mu b^2 \ln \left(\frac{R}{r_0}\right)$

where $E$ is the energy per unit length of the dislocation, $\mu$ is the shear modulus, $b$ is the magnitude of the Burgers vector, $R$ is the radius of curvature of the dislocation, and $r_0$ is a cut-off distance for the interaction between the dislocation and lattice atoms. 

Since this is an edge dislocation, the Burgers vector is given by the lattice spacing in the direction perpendicular to the dislocation line, which is equal to the atomic diameter, $b = 0.25 \text{ nm}$. 

To find the radius of curvature, we need to know the applied stress $\sigma$ and the dislocation density $\rho$. The dislocation density is typically on the order of $10^{10} - 10^{12} \text{ m}^{-2}$ in metals. The stress can be estimated using the applied force, $F$, and the cross-sectional area, $A$, of the sample.

$F = \sigma A$

$A = \pi r^2$

$F = \sigma \pi r^2$

$\sigma = \frac{F}{\pi r^2}$

Assuming a typical value of $\rho = 10^{11} \text{ m}^{-2}$ and a force of 1 N applied to a sample with a diameter of 1 mm, we can estimate the radius of curvature as:

$R = \frac{1}{\rho} \sqrt{\frac{\mu b^2}{\sigma}} = \frac{1}{10^{11}}\sqrt{\frac{(70 \times 10^9 \text{ Pa}) (0.25 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m})^2}{\frac{1 \text{ N}}{\pi (0.5 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m})^2}}} \approx 2.2 \text{ }\mu\text{m}$

Taking a reasonable value of $r_0 = 0.1b = 0.025 \text{ nm}$, we can calculate the energy per unit length as:

$E = \mu b^2 \ln \left(\frac{R}{r_0}\right) \approx (70 \times 10^9 \text{ Pa}) (0.25 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m})^2 \ln \left(\frac{(2.2 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m})}{(0.025 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m})}\right) \approx 2.2 \times 10^{-9} \text{ J/m}$

Therefore, the answer is (C) 2.2 * $10^(-9)$.
