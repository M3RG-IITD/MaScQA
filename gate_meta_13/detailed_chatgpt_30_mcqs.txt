In an FCC metal, the first two peaks in an X-ray diffraction pattern are typically the (1 1 1) and (2 0 0) planes.

The interplanar spacing (d) for a crystal plane with indices (h k l) can be calculated using Bragg's Law: 
d = λ / (2 sinθ)
where λ is the wavelength of the X-ray, θ is the angle between the X-ray beam and the crystal plane, and h, k, l are the Miller indices of the plane.

For the (1 1 1) plane in an FCC metal, h=k=l=1, and for the (2 0 0) plane, h=2, k=0, l=0.

We can assume that the wavelengths used in the X-ray diffraction experiment are the same for both peaks, which allows us to set up the following ratio:
d(1 1 1) / d(2 0 0) = (λ / (2 sinθ(1 1 1))) / (λ / (2 sinθ(2 0 0)))

Canceling out the λ and the 2's, we get:
d(1 1 1) / d(2 0 0) = sinθ(2 0 0) / sinθ(1 1 1)

Using the fact that sinθ = nλ / (2d) for each plane, we can rewrite the above equation as:
d(1 1 1) / d(2 0 0) = (n(2 0 0) d(1 1 1)) / (n(1 1 1) d(2 0 0))

We can simplify this further by recognizing that n(2 0 0) = 2 and n(1 1 1) = 3 for an FCC metal:
d(1 1 1) / d(2 0 0) = (2d(1 1 1)) / (3d(2 0 0))
d(2 0 0) / d(1 1 1) = (3/2) * (d(2 0 0) / d(1 1 1))
Taking the reciprocal of both sides and simplifying, we get:
d(1 1 1) / d(2 0 0) = (2/3)

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 1.91 (2/3 ≈ 1.91)
