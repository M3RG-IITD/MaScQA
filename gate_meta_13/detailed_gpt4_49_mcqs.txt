To solve this problem, we are going to use Fick's second law of diffusion and the Arrhenius equation for temperature dependence of diffusion coefficient.

First, let's recall Fick's second law of diffusion in one dimension:

$ \frac{\partial{C}}{\partial{t}} = D \frac{\partial^2{C}}{\partial{x^2}} $

Here, $C$ is the concentration of carbon, $t$ is the time, $x$ is the depth, and $D$ is the diffusion coefficient.

Next, let's recall the Arrhenius equation:

$ D = D_{o} e^{\frac{-Q}{RT}} $

Where $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, $D_{o}$ is a temperature-independent pre-exponential factor, $Q$ is the activation energy for diffusion, $R$ is the universal gas constant (8.314 J/molÂ·K), and $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.

In this problem, we know the initial concentration of carbon ($C_i = 0.2\%$), the surface concentration of carbon ($C_s = 1.2\%$), and the concentration at a certain depth ($C_x = 0.4\%$). We want to find the time it takes to double the depth at which 0.4 wt.% C is reached.

To solve for the required time, we first need to find the error function from Fick's second law of diffusion:

$ \frac{C_x - C_i}{C_s - C_i} = erf(\frac{x}{2 \sqrt{D \cdot t}}) $

In our case:

$ \frac{0.4-0.][: 1.2 - 0.2 = erf(\frac{x}{2 \sqrt{D \cdot t}}) $
  
$ \frac{0.2}{1} = erf(\frac{x}{2 \sqrt{D \cdot t}}) $

Now, we want to find the time it takes to double the depth. Let's denote the initial depth as x1 and the doubled depth as x2 = 2 * x1. Then, we can find the ratio of the error functions for the doubled depth and the initial depth:

$ erf(\frac{x_2}{2 \sqrt{Dt}}) / erf(\frac{x_1}{2 \sqrt{Dt}}) = 2 $

Since the temperature does not change in the problem, the diffusion coefficient $D$ does not change, and the ratio depends only on the depth ratio ($x_2/x_1$) and the time ratio $t_2/t_1$.

If we denote the required time as $t_2$ and let the initial time be $t_1$, we get:

$ \frac{erf(\frac{2x_1}{2 \sqrt{D \cdot t_2}})}{erf(\frac{x_1}{2 \sqrt{D \cdot t_1}})} = 2 $

Since $x_2 = 2x_1$, we have:

$ \frac{erf(\frac{2x_1}{2 \sqrt{D \cdot t_2}})}{erf(\frac{x_1}{2 \sqrt{D \cdot t_1}})} = \frac{erf(\frac{1}{\sqrt{t_2/t_1} })}{erf(\sqrt{t_2/t_1})} = 2 $

Now, to find the relationship between $t_1$ and $t_2$, we can use a trial and error method.

By trying out different $t_2/t_1$ ratios, we can look for a ratio that satisfies the equation above. After several trials, we find that $t_2/t_1 \approx 8$, meaning that it will take 8 times longer to double the depth.

Now, let's look at the answer choices to see which best fits the solution.

(A) 40
(B) 20
(C) 18
(D) 14

Looking at these answer choices, we can see that the difference between option A (40 hours) and B (20 hours) is 20 hours, which is approximately 8 times longer than the difference between B (20 hours) and C (18 hours), which is 2 hours. Therefore, the correct answer is:

$\boxed{\text{(B) 20}}$.
