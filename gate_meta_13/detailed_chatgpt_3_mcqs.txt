In a binary system A-B, the Gibbs free energy of mixing can be expressed as: 

$\Delta G_{mix}=x_Ax_B[\epsilon_{AB}-\frac{1}{2}(\epsilon_{AA}+\epsilon_{BB})]$

where $\Delta G_{mix}$ is the change in Gibbs free energy due to mixing, $x_A$ and $x_B$ are the mole fractions of components A and B, $\epsilon_{AB}$, $\epsilon_{AA}$ and $\epsilon_{BB}$ correspond to A-B, A-A and B-B bond energies respectively. 

The miscibility gap occurs when $\Delta G_{mix}$ is positive, indicating that the system is thermodynamically unfavourable towards mixing. Therefore, we need to find the condition for $\Delta G_{mix}$ to be positive. 

If $\epsilon_{AB} > \frac{1}{2}(\epsilon_{AA}+\epsilon_{BB})$, then the A-B bond is much stronger than the A-A and B-B bonds, which means that the system will preferentially form A-B bonds and phase separate into A-rich and B-rich regions, leading to a miscibility gap. 

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) $\epsilon_{AB} > \frac{1}{2}(\epsilon_{AA}+\epsilon_{BB})$
