Isothermal compressibility (κ) gives the measure of the relative change in volume of a material when subjected to a pressure change while the temperature is constant. It is defined as:

κ = -1/V * (∂V/∂p)$_T$

The negative sign indicates that κ is inversely proportional to the pressure, meaning that as pressure increases, κ decreases, and vice versa. Rearranging the equation, we get:

κ = -1/p * (∂V/∂p)$_T$

Therefore, the correct option is (A) -1/p* (∂V/∂p)$_T$.
