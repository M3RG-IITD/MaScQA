We will use Fick's second law of diffusion, which is given as: 

$$\frac{\partial C(x,t)}{\partial t} = \frac{D_o}{x}\frac{\partial^2 C(x,t)}{\partial x^2}$$

where, 
- $C(x,t)$ is the concentration of carbon at a distance x from the surface at time t.
- $D_o$ is the diffusion coefficient of carbon in austenite.
- $x$ is the distance from the surface.
- $t$ is the time of carburizing.

Assuming that the diffusion coefficient $D_o$ remains constant in the given temperature range and concentration range, we can integrate the above equation to obtain the following expression for carbon concentration as a function of distance and time:

$$C(x,t)=C_s+(C_0-C_s)erfc\left(\frac{x}{2\sqrt{D_o t}}\right)$$

where, 
- $C_s$ is the surface concentration of carbon.
- $C_0$ is the initial concentration of carbon in the steel specimen.
- $erfc$ is the complementary error function.

We are given: 
- $D_o$ = 2.0 * $10^{-5}$ $m^2/s$
- $Q$ = 142 kJ/mol
- $C_s$ = 1.2 wt.% C
- $C_0$ = 0.2 wt.% C
- The temperature of carburizing is 870Â°C.
- The time of carburizing is 10 hours.

To determine the depth at which a carbon concentration of 0.4 wt.% is obtained, we need to find the value of $x$ at which $C(x,t)=0.4$ wt.%. Rearranging the above equation, we get:

$$\frac{x}{2\sqrt{D_o t}}=erfc^{-1}\left(\frac{C_s-C(x,t)}{C_s-C_0}\right)$$

where, 
- $erfc^{-1}$ is the inverse of the complementary error function.

Substituting the given values, we get:

$$\frac{x}{2\sqrt{D_o t}}=erfc^{-1}\left(\frac{1.2-0.4}{1.2-0.2}\right)=erfc^{-1}(0.5)=0.4769$$

Hence, 

$$x=2\sqrt{D_o t}\times0.4769=2\times\sqrt{2\times10^{-5}\times36000}\times0.4769=113.024\mu m$$

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 113.
