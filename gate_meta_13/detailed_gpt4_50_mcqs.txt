To find the partial molar enthalpy of mixing for Cu, we need to first find the expression for the molar enthalpy of mixing and then find the derivative of that expression with respect to the mole fraction of Cu ($χ_(Cu)$).

The given expression for the integral enthalpy of mixing is as follows:
$$ΔH^(mix) = -19250 * χ_(Cu) * χ_(Zn)$$

Since the mole fractions of both components in the liquid solution (Cu and Zn) must add up to 1, we can write $χ_(Zn)$ as the following:
$$χ_(Zn) = 1 - χ_(Cu)$$

Now, substitute this expression back into the integral enthalpy of mixing expression:
$$ΔH^(mix) = -19250 * χ_(Cu) * (1 - χ_(Cu))$$

Next, take the derivative of this expression with respect to $χ_(Cu)$ to get the partial molar enthalpy of mixing for Cu:
$$\frac{d(ΔH^{(mix)})}{dχ_(Cu)} = \frac{d}{dχ_(Cu)}\left(-19250 * χ_(Cu) * (1 - χ_(Cu))\right)$$

We can use the product rule for differentiation here since we have a product of two terms. The product rule is given by:
$$(u * v)' = u' * v + u * v'$$

Let $u = -19250 * χ_(Cu)$ and $v = (1 - χ_(Cu))$. Then, calculate the derivatives of these terms:
$$u' = -19250$$
$$v' = -1$$

Now, apply the product rule:
$$\frac{d(ΔH^{(mix)})}{dχ_(Cu)} = (-19250) * (1 - χ_(Cu)) + (-19250 * χ_(Cu)) * (-1)$$

Simplify this expression by distributing the constants and combining like terms:
$$\frac{d(ΔH^{(mix)})}{dχ_(Cu)} = -19250 + 19250 * χ_(Cu) + 19250 * χ_(Cu)$$

$$\frac{d(ΔH^{(mix)})}{dχ_(Cu)} = -19250 + 38500 * χ_(Cu)$$

Now, compare this expression with the given options.

(A) $19250 * (χ_(Zn))^2$ is not equivalent to our result.
(B) $-19250 * (χ_(Cu))^2$ is not equivalent to our result.
(C) $38500 * χ_(Zn) - 19250 * (χ_(Zn))^2 - 19250$ is equivalent to our result after substituting $χ_(Zn) = 1 - χ_(Cu)$ and simplifying it.
(D) $-19250 * (χ_(Zn))^2$ is not equivalent to our result.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) $38500 * χ_(Zn) -19250 * (χ_(Zn))^2 - 19250$.
