The configurational entropy of a crystal is related to the number of ways in which its constituent particles can be arranged or distributed. If the concentration of point defects in a crystal increases, this means that there are more defects or vacancies in the crystal lattice, which can change the possible arrangements of the particles.

As a result, the configurational entropy of the crystal will increase. This is because there are more ways in which the particles can be distributed to accommodate the additional point defects.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

- (C) increases
