We can start by using the formula for maximum possible reduction in hot rolling:
$$
\Delta t_{max}=\frac{0.5 \mu \pi R^2}{\ln \left(\frac{h_i}{h_f}\right)}
$$
where $\mu$ is the coefficient of friction, $R$ is the roll radius, $h_i$ is the initial thickness, and $h_f$ is the final thickness.

In this case, we have $\mu=0.5$, $R=360$ mm, $h_i=480$ mm, and we want to find $\Delta t_{max}$ for some final thickness $h_f$ (which we can solve for later). Plugging in these values, we get:
$$
\Delta t_{max}=\frac{0.5 \times 0.5 \times \pi \times (360^2)}{\ln \left(\frac{480}{h_f}\right)}
$$
Simplifying the numerator, we have:
$$
\Delta t_{max}=\frac{0.25 \pi \times (360^2)}{\ln \left(\frac{480}{h_f}\right)}
$$
To maximize $\Delta t_{max}$, we need to minimize the denominator $\ln\left(\frac{480}{h_f}\right)$, which means maximizing $\frac{h_f}{480}$. This occurs when $h_f$ is minimized, which in this case means $h_f=0$ (i.e., we roll the slab completely flat). 

Plugging this value of $h_f$ into the formula for $\Delta t_{max}$, we get:
$$
\Delta t_{max}=\frac{0.25 \pi \times (360^2)}{\ln \left(\frac{480}{0}\right)}=360
$$
Therefore, the maximum possible reduction is 360 mm. 

The answer is (D) 360.
