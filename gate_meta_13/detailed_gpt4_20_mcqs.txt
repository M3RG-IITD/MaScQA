Risers, also known as feeders or chills, are used in the casting process to compensate for the shrinkage of the material as it solidifies in the mold. They provide additional molten metal that feeds into the casting to ensure it remains full and does not develop voids or other defects.

Now, let's analyze the given options and determine which material does not require risers during casting:

A) Stainless steel: Stainless steel is an alloy made of iron, chromium, and other elements. It is prone to shrinkage upon solidification, which can lead to defects in the castings. Consequently, risers are needed when casting stainless steel.

B) Plain carbon steel: Plain carbon steel has varying amounts of carbon content which influences the casting process. For high carbon content, the steel may shrink upon solidification and require risers to compensate for shrinkage and avoid defects in casting.

C) Grey cast iron: Grey cast iron contains graphite flakes in its structure, which can provide cushioning when the cast iron is cooled and solidified. This cushioning helps prevent shrinkage during solidification, making risers unnecessary for casting grey cast iron.

D) White cast iron: White cast iron, which is basically cast iron without graphite flakes, is more brittle and prone to shrinkage during solidification. Consequently, risers are required to compensate for that shrinkage, ensuring the casting remains full and free of defects.

Hence, the correct answer is:
[C] Grey cast iron
