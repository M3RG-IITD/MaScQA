To calculate the energy of an edge dislocation in a crystal lattice, we use the following formula:

Energy per unit length (E) = (G * b^2) / 2π(1 - ν)

where G is the shear modulus, b is the magnitude of the Burgers vector, and ν is the Poisson's ratio.

For α-Fe, the shear modulus (G) is 70 GPa, and the atomic diameter is 0.25 nm. To find the Burgers vector (b), we should use the following relationship:

b = atomic radius * √2

The atomic radius is half the atomic diameter, so in this case, the atomic radius is 0.25 nm / 2 = 0.125 nm. Thus, the Burgers vector (b) is:

b = 0.125 nm * √2 ≈ 0.177 nm

Now, we need to find the Poisson's ratio (ν) for α-Fe. Poisson's ratio varies for different materials, but for metals, it is typically around 0.3. Therefore, we can assume ν = 0.3 for α-Fe.

Now we can calculate the energy per unit length (E):

E = (70 GPa * (0.177 nm)^2) / 2π(1 - 0.3)
E = (70 * 10^9 Pa * (0.177 * 10^-9 m)^2) / 2π(0.7)
E = (70 * 10^9 * 3.13 * 10^-18) / (1.396 * π)
E = 2.177 * 10^(-9) J/m

The correct answer is (C) 2.2 * 10^(-9) J/m.

Answer: [2.2 * 10^(-9)]
