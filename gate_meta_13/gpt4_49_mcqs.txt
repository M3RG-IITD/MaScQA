We are given that the depth at which a concentration of 0.4 wt.% C is reached has doubled. According to Fick's second law, the time required for the diffusion process is proportional to the square of the depth.

Let $t_1$ be the time required to reach the 0.4 wt.% concentration at the initial depth, and $t_2$ be the time required to reach the same concentration at double the depth. Then we have:

$$t_2 = k \times (2d)^2 = 4k\times d^2 = 4\times t_1$$

Using this equation, we find that the time will be 4 times the initial time to reach the 0.4 wt.% concentration. The question asks how long it takes to double the depth, so we need to find the factor by which the time has increased. 

Hence, the answer is:

$$t_2 - t_1 = 4t_1 - t_1 = 3t_1$$

So, the time required to double the depth is three times the initial time. Unfortunately, no specific value is mentioned for the initial time in the given data. Therefore, as per the given options, we cannot identify a unique answer, and additional information is required to solve the problem.
