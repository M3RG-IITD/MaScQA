To understand this question, first, let's discuss the terms mentioned in the options.

1. $(c_p)^(α)$ and $(c_p)^(β)$: These represent specific heat capacities at constant pressure for phases α and β, respectively. Specific heat determines how much energy is required to change the temperature of a substance by a certain amount.

2. $(V_m)^(α)$ and $(V_m)^(β)$: These represent molar volumes for phases α and β, respectively. Molar volume is the volume occupied by one mole of a substance.

3. $(G_m)^(α)$ and $(G_m)^(β)$: These represent molar Gibbs free energy for phases α and β, respectively. Gibbs free energy is a thermodynamic potential that measures the maximum reversible work that may be performed by a system at constant temperature and pressure.

4. $(μ_i)^(α)$ and $(μ_i)^(β)$: These represent the chemical potential of component 'i' for phases α and β, respectively. Chemical potential is a measure of how the energy of a substance changes with the number of particles at constant temperature, volume, and pressure.

Now let's analyze the given options:

(A) $(c_p)^(α) = (c_p)^(β)$: This is not necessarily true for phases in thermodynamic equilibrium, as the specific heat capacities may be different for different phases.

(B) $(V_m)^(α) = (V_m)^(β)$: This is not necessarily true for phases in thermodynamic equilibrium, as the molar volumes may be different for different phases.

(C) $(G_m)^(α) = (G_m)^(β)$: This is true for phases in thermodynamic equilibrium. When two or more phases are in equilibrium, their molar Gibbs free energies must be equal. If one phase had a lower Gibbs free energy than the other, the phase with the higher Gibbs free energy would transform into the phase with the lower Gibbs free energy until equilibrium is reached.

(D) $(μ_i)^(α) = (μ_i)^(β)$: This is also true for phases in thermodynamic equilibrium. The chemical potential of a component 'i' must be equal in all coexisting phases to maintain equilibrium. If the chemical potentials were different, there would be a driving force for the component to move from the phase with a higher chemical potential to the phase with a lower chemical potential until equilibrium is reached.

Therefore, the correct answer is [C, D].
