The balanced electrochemical reaction is:

Sn + 2 H+ → Sn2+ + H2

The standard reduction potential for Sn2+ +2e– → Sn is –0.136 V versus SHE.

The Nernst equation for the given reaction is:

E = E° – (0.0592 V/n) log Q

where E° is the standard reduction potential, n is the number of electrons transferred, Q is the reaction quotient, and 0.0592 V/n is the room temperature (298K) natural logarithm of 10.

At pH 5, the [H+] concentration is 10–5 M. The reaction quotient Q is:

Q = [Sn2+][H2] / ([Sn][H+]^2)

Substituting the given values:

Q = (10–2)(1) / ([Sn][10–5]^2) = 10–10 / [Sn]

Using the Nernst equation:

E = –0.136 V – (0.0592 V/2) log (10–10 / [Sn])

E = –0.136 V + (0.0296 V) log [Sn]

At equilibrium, E = 0. Therefore:

0 = –0.136 V + (0.0296 V) log [Sn]

log[Sn] = 4.59

[Sn] = 3.79 × 10–5 M

Comparing the initial and final [Sn2+] concentrations, we see that [Sn2+] has decreased. Therefore, Sn2+ has undergone reduction, and the correct answer is (C).
