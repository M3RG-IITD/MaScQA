Step 1: Find the number of atoms in the unit cell
An FCC metal has a total of 4 atoms within its unit cell. This is because an FCC metal has 1/8 of an atom from each corner (total of 8 corners) and 1/2 of an atom from each face (total of 6 faces):

Atoms in the unit cell = (8 corners * 1/8 atom per corner) + (6 faces * 1/2 atom per face) = 4 atoms

Step 2: Calculate the volume of the unit cell
The volume of the unit cell is given by the formula V = a^3, where a is the lattice parameter (in this case, 0.2 nm):

V = (0.2 nm)^3 = 0.008 nm³

Step 3: Convert the volume from nm³ to m³
1 nm = 10^(-9) m, so the volume conversion is:

V = 0.008 nm³ * (10^(-9))^3 = 8 × 10^(-27) m³

Step 4: Calculate the total magnetic moment in the unit cell
The total magnetic moment (M) in the unit cell can be determined from the saturation magnetization (Ms), volume (V), and the number of atoms within the unit cell:

M = Ms × V × number of atoms
M = 600 kA/m × 8 × 10^(-27) m³/unit cell × 4 atoms/unit cell
M = 4800 × 10^(-27) A m²/atom

Step 5: Convert the total magnetic moment from A m² to Bohr magneton (μB)
1 Bohr magneton (μB) equals 9.274 x 10^(-24) A m², so to convert from A m² to Bohr magneton, we can divide the total magnetic moment by the Bohr magneton value:

Magnetic moment in Bohr magneton = M / μB
Magnetic moment in Bohr magneton = (4800 × 10^(-27) A m²/atom) / (9.274 x 10^(-24) A m²/μB)
Magnetic moment in Bohr magneton ≈ 0.517 μB/atom

The correct answer is (C) 0.517.
