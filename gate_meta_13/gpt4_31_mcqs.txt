First, we find the number of gearwheels above the required tolerance.
Total gearwheels = 150
Required tolerance gearwheels = 112
Below tolerance gearwheels = 21
Above tolerance gearwheels = 150 - 112 - 21 = 17

Now, we find the probability of selecting a gearwheel below the tolerance.
Probability_below = (Number of below tolerance gearwheels) / (Total number of gearwheels) 
                          = 21 / 150

After selecting a below tolerance gearwheel, there are now 149 gearwheels left. We find the probability of selecting a gearwheel above the tolerance.
Probability_above = (Number of above tolerance gearwheels) / (Total number of gearwheels - 1) 
                              = 17 / 149

To find the combined probability, we multiply the two individual probabilities.
Combined_probability = Probability_below * Probability_above
                                   = (21 / 150) * (17 / 149) = 357 / 22350 â‰ˆ 0.016

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 0.016. Answer: [0.016].
