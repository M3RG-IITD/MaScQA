The Gibbs energy of nucleation is given by the following equation:

ΔG = ΔGv + ΔGs

where ΔGv is the change in the volume energy, and ΔGs is the change in the surface energy.

At equilibrium temperature, the Gibbs free energy change is zero. Therefore, we can write:

ΔGv + ΔGs = 0

Since both ΔGv and ΔGs are always positive, their sum cannot be zero. This means that there is no critical value of the Gibbs energy of nucleation at equilibrium temperature.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) zero
