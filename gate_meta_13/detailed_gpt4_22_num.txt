To calculate the atomic packing fraction of a diamond cubic structure, we need to determine the volume occupied by atoms in a unit cell and divide it by the volume of the unit cell. The atomic packing fraction gives the efficiency with which atoms are packed into a crystal structure.

A diamond cubic structure is a type of face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice with a repeating pattern of eight atoms in the corners of a cube and six atoms on the face centers.

Step 1: Number of atoms in a unit cell
In a diamond cubic structure, there is 1/8 of an atom in each corner and 1/2 of an atom on each face.
Number of atoms = (8 corners x 1/8) + (6 faces x 1/2) = 1 + 3 = 4 atoms

Step 2: Volume occupied by atoms
We assume that atoms are spherical and tightly packed. Therefore, the volume occupied by atoms in the unit cell is the sum of the volumes of the four atoms.
Volume of one atom = (4/3)πr^3
Volume of four atoms = 4 x (4/3)πr^3 = (16/3)πr^3

Step 3: Volume of the unit cell
The lattice constant (edge length) of a unit cell is given by 'a'. In an FCC structure, the relationship between the lattice constant and the atomic radius (r) is:
a = 4r / √2 

The volume of the unit cell is given by V = a^3.
Using the relationship between 'a' and 'r', we can rewrite the volume as:
V = (4r / √2)^3 => V = (64r^3) / (2√2)

Step 4: Calculating the atomic packing fraction (APF)
APF = (Volume occupied by atoms) / (Volume of the unit cell)
APF = [(16/3)πr^3] / [(64r^3) / (2√2)]
APF = (8√2/3)π

The atomic packing fraction of a diamond cubic structure is approximately (8√2/3)π or 0.34.
