The given element has its maximum linear density along the [110] direction. This means that along the diagonal of the cubic unit cell, atoms are packed more closely than along the sides of the unit cell.

Let's first determine the unit cell structure of the given element. Since the maximum linear density along the [110] direction is stated, the unit cell should intuitively be a body-centered unit cell (BCC) structure, as the [110] direction would include both corner and body-centered atoms.

Now let's determine the packing density of (100) planes in this crystal structure.

In a BCC unit cell, there are:
- 8 corner atoms that contribute ⅛ of their volume to the unit cell.
- 1 body-centered atom that contributes fully to the unit cell.

Total atoms in a unit cell = (8 * 1/8) + 1 = 2 atoms

In the (100) plane of BCC crystal structure, there is:
- 4 partial corner atoms that contribute ¼ on the plane.
- No contribution from the body-centered atom.

Total atoms on the (100) plane = 4 * ¼ = 1 atom

The packing density (PD) of a plane can be calculated as follows:

PD = (total atoms on the plane) / (Total atoms in a unit cell)
PD = 1/2

Now, we need to convert the packing density into a percentage. To do this, simply multiply the packing density by 100.

PD = (1/2) * 100 = 50%

Therefore, the packing density of the given element's (100) plane is not among the provided options. However, if we analyze the available options, we can say that the packing density is lesser than all the given options [(A) 0.68, (B) 0.74, (C) 0.79, (D) 0.91].

The answer is: 'None of the given options'.
