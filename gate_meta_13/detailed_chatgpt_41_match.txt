P - Jigging involves the separation of particles with different densities by shaking them in water. Heavy particles settle to the bottom, and lighter particles are carried to the top.

Q - Tabling involves shaking the particles in a horizontal motion with a riffled surface. The heavier particles settle in the riffles, and lighter particles are carried away.

R - Heavy media separation involves the separation of materials based on their density using a dense media solution. The dense media solution sinks the denser material, while the lighter material floats.

S - Flotation involves the attachment of particles to air bubbles to separate particles with different surface properties. The bubbles rise to the surface with the attached particles.

From the above explanation, it can be concluded that:
P - 2 (Difference in density)
Q - 4 (Differential lateral movement)
R - 1 (Modification of surface tension)
S - 3 (Differential initial acceleration)

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) P-2, Q-4, R-1, S-3.
