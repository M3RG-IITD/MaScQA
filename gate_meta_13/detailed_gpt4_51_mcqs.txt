To solve this problem, we need to recall the definition of the enthalpy of mixing for a regular solution model and determine the solution parameter.

For a regular solution, the enthalpy of mixing (ΔH_mix) is given by:

ΔH_mix = Ω * χ_A * χ_B

Here Ω is the solution parameter, χ_A and χ_B are the mole fractions of A and B in the solution.

In our case, we have a liquid (Cu, Zn) solution with the enthalpy of mixing given as follows:

ΔH_mix = -19250 * χ_Cu * χ_Zn

Comparing the provided enthalpy of mixing equation with the general equation for a regular solution model, we can determine the solution parameter:

Ω = -19250 J/mol

Hence, the correct answer is (A) -19250.

Answer: [-19250]
