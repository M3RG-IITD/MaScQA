To calculate the heat input per unit length for arc welding, we need to find the power of the arc and divide it by the welding speed. 

Step 1: Determine the power of the arc.
Arc welding power (P) can be calculated using the formula:

P = I * V

where:
P = power of the arc (in watts)
I = current (in amperes)
V = voltage (in volts)

Given:
I = 200 A
V = 20 V

Now, plug the given values into the formula:

P = 200 A * 20 V
P = 4000 W

So, the power of the arc is 4000 W.

Step 2: Convert the power into kilojoules (kJ).

We know that 1 watt is equal to 0.001 kilojoules per second (kJ/s). So, we can convert the power into kJ:

Power (kJ/s) = 4000 W * 0.001 kJ/Ws
Power (kJ/s) = 4 kJ/s

Step 3: Calculate heat input per unit length.

Now, we need to divide the power (in kJ/s) by the welding speed (in m/s) to get the heat input per unit length (in kJ/m):

Heat input per unit length (kJ/m) = Power (kJ/s) / Welding speed (m/s)

Given:
Power (kJ/s) = 4 kJ/s
Welding speed = 0.01 m/s

Now, plug the given values into the formula:

Heat input per unit length (kJ/m) = 4 kJ/s / 0.01 m/s
Heat input per unit length (kJ/m) = 400 kJ/m

So, the heat input per unit length for the given arc welding is 400 kJ/m.
