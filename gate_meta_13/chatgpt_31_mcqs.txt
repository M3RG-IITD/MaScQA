First, we need to find the probability of selecting a gearwheel below the tolerance. 

P(selecting below tolerance) = 21/150 

After one gearwheel has been picked, there will be 149 gearwheels remaining in the box, out of which 112 are in tolerance and 37 are above. 

So, the probability of selecting a gearwheel above tolerance now is: 

P(selecting above tolerance) = 37/149 

To find the combined probability, we need to multiply the probabilities of the two events: 

P(selecting below tolerance) × P(selecting above tolerance) 

= (21/150) × (37/149) 

= 777/11175 

= 0.0694 

Therefore, the correct answer is not listed. The closest answer is (B) 0.032, which is incorrect.
