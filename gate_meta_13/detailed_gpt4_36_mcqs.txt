To solve this problem, we will use the formula for "maximum reduction" in a hot-rolled slab, considering the factors of coefficient of friction and diameter of the roll. The formula is given by:

Maximum reduction = µ * R, where µ is the coefficient of friction and R is the radius of the roll.

Step 1: Convert diameter to radius
The diameter of the roll is given as 720 mm. To find the radius, we need to divide the diameter by 2.
Radius (R) = 720 mm / 2 = 360 mm.

Step 2: Calculate the maximum reduction using the formula
Now, we have the coefficient of friction (µ) as 0.5 and the radius (R) as 360 mm. We can now calculate the maximum reduction using the formula mentioned above.
Maximum reduction = µ * R = 0.5 * 360 mm = 180 mm

So, the maximum possible reduction (in mm) is 180, which corresponds to option (B).

Answer: [B]
