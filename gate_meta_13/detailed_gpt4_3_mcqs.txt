To find the condition for the miscibility gap in a binary system A-B, we need to analyze the bond energies $ε_{AA}$, $ε_{BB}$, and $ε_{AB}$. The miscibility gap occurs when the energy of A-B bonds is significantly higher than the average energy of A-A and B-B bonds, which means that it is energetically unfavorable for A and B to mix.

We can express the average energy of A-A and B-B bonds as:

Average energy = $\frac{1}{2}(ε_{AA} + ε_{BB})$

Now, let's consider the four given options:

(A) $ε_{AB} > \frac{1}{2}(ε_{AA} + ε_{BB})$

In this case, the energy of A-B bonds is greater than the average energy of A-A and B-B bonds, which indicates that it is energetically unfavorable for A and B to mix. Therefore, a miscibility gap will occur.

(B) $ε_{AB} < \frac{1}{2}(ε_{AA} + ε_{BB})$

In this case, the energy of A-B bonds is less than the average energy of A-A and B-B bonds, which indicates that it is energetically favorable for A and B to mix. Therefore, a miscibility gap will not occur.

(C) $ε_{AB} = \frac{1}{2}(ε_{AA} + ε_{BB})$

In this case, the energy of A-B bonds is equal to the average energy of A-A and B-B bonds, which indicates that there is no significant energetic difference between A-A, B-B, and A-B bonds. Therefore, a miscibility gap will not occur.

(D) $ε_{AB} < \frac{1}{4}(ε_{AA} + ε_{BB})$

In this case, the energy of A-B bonds is much less than the average energy of A-A and B-B bonds, which indicates that it is energetically favorable for A and B to mix even more. Therefore, a miscibility gap will not occur.

Based on the analysis, option (A) is the correct condition for the miscibility gap to occur in a binary system A-B.

The correct answer is: [(A)]
