To find the maximum true uniform strain for the material, we need to determine the maximum value for the true stress (σ). To do this, we can differentiate the given equation with respect to true strain (ε) and set it to zero, which helps us determine the critical points.

Given:
σ = 1050 * ε^(0.25)

First, we find the derivative of σ with respect to ε:

dσ/dε = d(1050 * ε^(0.25))/dε

Using the chain rule of differentiation, we get:

dσ/dε = 1050 * 0.25 * ε^(-0.75)

Now, we need to set this equation to zero to find the critical points:

0 = 1050 * 0.25 * ε^(-0.75)

We can see that ε^(-0.75) can never be 0. This means that there aren't any critical points in this case. However, we can still use the first derivative to analyze the behavior of the stress (σ) as a function of strain (ε).

Since ε^(-0.75) is always positive, the first derivative dσ/dε will also be positive for all strains (ε). This means that the stress (σ) will continually increase as the strain (ε) increases, and there is no maximum uniform strain that will limit the stress in this case.

So, in this case, we can't find a maximum value for the true uniform strain as the stress (σ) will keep increasing as the strain (ε) increases.

Therefore, the answer is:

[None]
