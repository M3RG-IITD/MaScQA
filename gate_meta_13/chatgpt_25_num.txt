The heat input in kJ per unit length is calculated using the following formula:

Heat Input = Voltage x Current x Welding speed x Efficiency / 1000

Assuming an efficiency of 60%, we get:

Heat Input = 20 V x 200 A x 0.01 m/s x 60 / 1000

Heat Input = 24 J/m

Therefore, the heat input in kJ per unit length is 0.024 kJ/m.

Answer: [0.024 kJ/m]
