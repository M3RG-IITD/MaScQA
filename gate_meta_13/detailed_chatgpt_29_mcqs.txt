Given, 

Maximum linear density is along [110] direction.

Let's assume that the element is a simple cubic lattice. In a simple cubic lattice, the only direction with atoms is along the body diagonal, i.e., the [111] direction. Therefore, [110] is perpendicular to the atoms, and hence it has the maximum linear density.

Now, we need to find the packing density of the (100) plane of the element.

For a simple cubic lattice, each atom on the (100) plane has 4 nearest neighbors on the same plane, and 4 nearest neighbors in the layers above and below the plane. 

This can be visualized as follows: 

```
          Layer above the (100) plane
                 o o
          o o  x
                 o o
          
          o o  x   Atoms on the (100) plane
                o o
          
                 o o
          o o  x
                 o o
          
          Layer below the (100) plane
```
          
Here, `x` represents the atom on the (100) plane, and `o` represents the atoms in the layers above and below the (100) plane.

Therefore, the coordination number of the (100) plane is 8, i.e., each atom on the (100) plane is surrounded by 8 atoms.

Now, we can use the formula for packing density:

$$\text{Packing density} = \frac{\text{Volume occupied by atoms}}{\text{Total volume of unit cell}}$$

For a simple cubic lattice, the volume occupied by atoms is given by:

Volume of 1 atom = (4/3)πr^3  (where r is the atomic radius)
Volume of 8 atoms (surrounding the central atom on the (100) plane) = 8 × (1/2) × (4/3)πr^3  (since they are shared by 8 adjacent atoms)
Total volume of atoms on the (100) plane = (1/2) × (4/3)πr^3

Therefore, packing density of the (100) plane is given by:

$$\text{Packing density} = \frac{(1/2) × (4/3)πr^3}{a^2}$$
(where a is the lattice parameter)

Now, we need to use the fact that the maximum linear density is along the [110] direction. In a simple cubic lattice, the [110] direction is perpendicular to the (100) plane and passes through the center of the atoms in the plane. Therefore, the atomic radius along the [110] direction is equal to the distance between adjacent atoms in the (100) plane, which is a/√2.

Therefore, we have:

$$\frac{\text{Maximum linear density along [110] direction}}{\text{Length of [110] direction in unit cell}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}a}$$

$$\Rightarrow \text{Length of [110] direction in unit cell} = \sqrt{2}a$$

Now, we can substitute this value in the formula for packing density:

$$\text{Packing density} = \frac{(1/2) × (4/3)πr^3}{(\sqrt{2}a)^2} = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}} × \frac{4}{3}π\left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^3 = \frac{2}{3\sqrt{2}}πr^3$$

Therefore, the packing density of the (100) plane is:

$$\text{Packing density} = \frac{2}{3\sqrt{2}}πr^3$$

This is the packing density for a simple cubic lattice. However, we do not know whether the element in question is actually a simple cubic lattice.

But we can compare this value with the options given:

(A) 0.68  (B) 0.74  (C) 0.79  (D) 0.91

Out of these options, only option (B) lies in the range of the packing density for simple cubic lattice:

$$\frac{2}{3\sqrt{2}}π \approx 0.7405$$

Therefore, the answer is:

(B) 0.74
