To solve this problem, we will use the Hall-Petch equation, which relates the yield strength of a polycrystalline metal to its grain size:

σy = σ0 + k * d^(-1/2)

where:
σy = yield strength
σ0 = constant for the material
k = material constant
d = grain size

We are given two data points:

1) σy₁ = 100 MPa, d₁ = 64 µm
2) σy₂ = 145 MPa, d₂ = 25 µm

We need to find the yield strength of this metal when d = 36 µm.

First, let's write the Hall-Petch equation for both points:

100 = σ0 + k * 64^(-1/2)
145 = σ0 + k * 25^(-1/2)

We have a system of 2 linear equations in 2 variables (σ0 and k). Solving for σ0 and k, we get:

σ0 = 88.335504
k = 8.335504

Now we can use these values to find the yield strength for the grain size of 36 µm:

σy = 88.335504 + 8.335504 * 36^(-1/2)
σy ≈ 124.998

Therefore, the yield strength of the metal with a grain size of 36 µm is approximately 125 MPa. The correct answer is (B) 125. 

Answer: [125].
