Let's analyze the suitability of the non-destructive testing methods in Group I for the detection of defects in Group II:

(P) Magnetic particle inspection: This method is used for detecting surface and near-surface discontinuities in ferromagnetic materials. Martensitic stainless steels are ferromagnetic, while austenitic stainless steels are not. Therefore, a magnetic particle inspection can detect (1) Surface crack in martensitic stainless steels, but not (2) Surface crack in austenitic stainless steels.

(Q) X-ray radiography: This method is useful for detecting internal flaws such as inclusions and voids in a wide range of materials. X-ray radiography can detect inclusions in steels, so it is suitable for (4) Inclusions in steels.

(R) Dye penetrant test: This method is used to reveal surface-breaking defects in non-porous materials, including both metallic and non-metallic materials. It can detect (2) Surface crack in austenitic stainless steels and (3) Hairline crack in aluminium.

(S) Ultrasonic testing: This method uses high-frequency sound waves to detect internal and subsurface defects in a wide range of materials. It can detect both (1) Surface crack in martensitic stainless steels and (3) Hairline crack in aluminium. However, since magnetic particle inspection is already suitable for (1) Surface crack in martensitic stainless steels, ultrasonic testing is a better fit for (3) Hairline crack in aluminium.

By matching the methods with the appropriate defects, we get:

(P) Magnetic particle inspection - (1) Surface crack in martensitic stainless steels
(Q) X-ray radiography - (4) Inclusions in steels
(R) Dye penetrant test - (2) Surface crack in austenitic stainless steels
(S) Ultrasonic testing - (3) Hairline crack in aluminium

So the correct answer is option (D) P-1, Q-4, R-2, S-3.
