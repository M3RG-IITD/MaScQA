Polypropylene has a semi-crystalline structure, which means that it consists of both crystalline and amorphous regions. The density of polypropylene increases with increasing crystallinity. Therefore, we can use the given information about the density of the two samples to determine their relative crystallinities.

The sample with a density of 1.3 g/$cm^3$ has a relatively high density, which suggests a high degree of crystallinity. Conversely, the sample with a density of 0.92 g/$cm^3$ has a relatively low density, which suggests a lower degree of crystallinity.

We can use the following relationship to determine the percent crystallinity of each sample:

Percent crystallinity = (Sample density - Amorphous density) / (Crystalline density - Amorphous density) x 100%

The values of amorphous and crystalline density for polypropylene are approximately 0.85 and 0.945 g/$cm^3$, respectively.

For the sample with a density of 1.3 g/$cm^3$:

Percent crystallinity = (1.3 - 0.85) / (0.945 - 0.85) x 100% = 63.3%

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 64.
