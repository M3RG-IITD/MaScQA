Fatigue life is the time of repeated application of a load below the ultimate tensile strength of the metal where failure occurs due to fluctuating failures. The following are the methods to improve fatigue life:

(A) Nitriding: Nitriding is a heat treatment process applied to steel to improve the surface hardness and fatigue life. It is a process of diffusion of nitrogen atoms into the metal surface, and it improves fatigue resistance.

(B) Decarburization: Decarburization is the loss of carbon in the surface of the metal due to heating. It reduces the fatigue life of the steel component.

(C) Improving surface finish: The smoother the surface of the metal, the higher the fatigue life. The rough surface leads to stress concentrations, reduces fatigue life, and increases the risk of fatigue fractures.

(D) Shot-peening: Shot peening is the process of bombarding the metal surface with steel shots or glass beads. It induces compression stress at the surface of the metal, which improves fatigue life.

Therefore, the answer is (B) Decarburization, which reduces the fatigue life of the steel component.
