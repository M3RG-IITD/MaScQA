An Ellingham diagram is a graphical representation that helps predict the stability of various metal oxides in the presence of carbon, which is a common reducing agent. The diagram plots the standard Gibbs free energy change of formation of various metal oxides (\(\Delta G^{°}\)) as functions of temperature.

When a reducing agent reacts with a metal oxide, the reduction can occur if the Gibbs free energy change is negative, implying that the reaction is spontaneous:

\(C + MO \rightarrow M + CO\)

The same for the second metal oxide:

\(C + M′O \rightarrow M′ + CO\)

When lines for C-CO and M-MO intersect at temperature \(T_1\), it means that at this temperature, the Gibbs free energy changes for these reactions are equal:

\(\Delta G_{CO} = \Delta G_{MO}\)

Given that the temperature is greater than \(T_1\) and smaller than \(T_2\), let's call this temperature \(T\). According to the Ellingham diagram, the lines have a negative slope, meaning that the Gibbs free energy change decreases with increasing temperature:

\(\Delta G_{CO}(T_1) = \Delta G_{MO}(T_1)\)

\(\Delta G_{CO}(T_2) = \Delta G_{M' O}(T_2)\)

Since the C-CO line has a negative slope in Ellingham diagram:

\(\Delta G_{CO}(T) > \Delta G_{CO}(T_1) = \Delta G_{MO}(T_1)\)

Since \(T\) is between \(T_1\) and \(T_2\), and \(T_2\) is higher temperature than \(T\), we have:

\(\Delta G_{CO}(T) > \Delta G_{M' O}(T) > \Delta G_{CO}(T_2) = \Delta G_{M' O}(T_2)\)

Now, let's analyze the possible reductions.

(A) MO:

If we subtract \(\Delta G_{MO}(T_1)\) from the inequality above:

\(\Delta G_{CO}(T) - \Delta G_{MO}(T_1) > \Delta G_{M' O}(T) - \Delta G_{MO}(T_1)\)

Since \(\Delta G_{CO}(T_1) = \Delta G_{MO}(T_1)\), we have:

\(\Delta G_{CO}(T) - \Delta G_{CO}(T_1) > \Delta G_{M' O}(T) - \Delta G_{MO}(T_1)\)

The left-hand side represents the change in Gibbs free energy for the reaction \(C + MO \rightarrow M + CO\) at temperature \(T\), which is positive, meaning the reaction is not spontaneous. Therefore, carbon cannot reduce MO at this temperature.

(B) both MO and M′O:

We have already ruled out MO, so this option is not possible.

(C) M′O:

If we subtract \(\Delta G_{M' O}(T_2)\) from the established inequality:

\(\Delta G_{CO}(T) - \Delta G_{M' O}(T_2) > \Delta G_{M' O}(T) - \Delta G_{M' O}(T_2)\)

Since \(\Delta G_{CO}(T_2) = \Delta G_{M' O}(T_2)\), we have:

\(\Delta G_{CO}(T) - \Delta G_{CO}(T_2) > \Delta G_{M' O}(T) - \Delta G_{M' O}(T_2)\)

The left-hand side represents the change in Gibbs free energy for the reaction \(C + M′O \rightarrow M′ + CO\) at temperature \(T\), which is positive, meaning the reaction is spontaneous. Therefore, carbon can reduce M′O at this temperature.

(D) neither MO nor M′O:

We have already ruled this option out by establishing that carbon can reduce M′O.

So the answer is:
