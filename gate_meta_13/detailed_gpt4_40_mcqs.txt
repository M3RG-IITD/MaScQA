To determine which of the following is true, we need to first write down the half-cell reactions, find the cell potential, and then determine the reaction feasibility.

1. Write down the half-cell reactions
For Sn:
$Sn^{2+}$ + $2e^{-}$ → Sn (reduction)

For $H^+$:
$2H^+$ + $2e^-$ → $H_2$ (reduction)

2. Find the equilibrium constants
For the Sn half-cell, we have the given standard reduction potential:
$E^0_{Sn}$ = -0.136 V 

For the $H^+$ half-cell, the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) is used as the reference:
$E^0_{H^+}$ = 0 V

3. Find cell potential using the Nernst Equation
$E_{cell} = E^0_{cell} - \frac{RT}{nF} ln(Q)$

For SN reduction + H+ oxidation:
$Q = \frac{[Sn^{2+}]}{[H^+]^2} = \frac{10^{-2}}{10^{-5}} = 10^3$

For $H^+$ reduction:
$pH = 5, [H^+] = 10^{-5}$ M

Now, we calculate the cell potential for each half-cell reaction:

For Sn reduction + H+ oxidation:
$n_Sn = 2$ (2 electrons involved in Sn half-cell)
$E_{cell, Sn} = -0.136 - \frac{(8.314)(298)}{(2)(96485)}ln(10^3)$
$E_{cell, Sn} = -0.136 - \frac{(8.314)(298)}{(2)(96485)}(3ln10)$
$E_{cell, Sn} \approx -0.321 V$

For H+ reduction:
$n_{H^+} = 2$ (2 electrons involved in H+ half-cell)
Since $E^0_{H^+}$ = 0 V,
$E_{cell, H^+} = 0 - \frac{(8.314)(298)}{(2)(96485)}ln(10^5)$
$E_{cell, H^+} = -\frac{(8.314)(298)}{(2)(96485)}(5ln10)$
$E_{cell, H^+} \approx -0.059 V$

4. Determine reaction feasibility
Since $E_{cell, Sn}$ < $E_{cell, H^+}$, the Sn reduction reaction is more likely to proceed in the given conditions.

Thus, the correct options are:
(A) Sn undergoes oxidation
(B) $H^+$ undergoes reduction

Answer: [Sn undergoes oxidation, $H^+$ undergoes reduction]
