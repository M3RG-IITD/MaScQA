Heat can be transferred between objects or systems by three different modes:

1. Conduction: It is the transfer of heat through a material by molecular collisions. In this process, the heat energy moves from higher temperature to lower temperature until both objects reach thermal equilibrium.

2. Convection: It is the transfer of heat by the movement of a fluid or gas. It involves the transfer of heat from one region to another by the circulation of fluids.

3. Radiation: It is the transfer of heat through electromagnetic waves. This mode of heat transfer does not require any physical medium to transfer heat.

Therefore, the total number of possible heat transfer modes is three:

1. Conduction
2. Convection
3. Radiation

The correct answer is:

- Three
