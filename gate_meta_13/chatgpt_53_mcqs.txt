There exists a relationship between density and crystallinity for polypropylene. The higher the density, the higher is the percent crystallinity. This relationship can be used to estimate the percent crystallinity for a given density. 

As per this relationship, the percent crystallinity of polypropylene sample having a density of 1.3 g/$cm^3$ can be estimated to be around 64%. 

Therefore, the correct answer is: 

- (B) 64
