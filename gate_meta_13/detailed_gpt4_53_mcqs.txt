To determine the percent crystallinity of the polypropylene sample with a density of 1.3 g/cm³, we can use the following formula:

% Crystallinity = (Density of the sample - Density of amorphous) / (Density of crystalline - Density of amorphous) * 100

First, we need to find the density of amorphous and crystalline polypropylene. Here are the standard values for amorphous and crystalline densities of polypropylene:

- Density of amorphous polypropylene: 0.855 g/cm³
- Density of crystalline polypropylene: 0.946 g/cm³

Now we can use the formula to find the percent crystallinity of the sample:

% Crystallinity = (1.3 - 0.855) / (0.946 - 0.855) * 100
% Crystallinity = (0.445) / (0.091) * 100

% Crystallinity ≈ 4.8901 * 100

% Crystallinity ≈ 489.01%

However, the given percent crystallinity values in the options are all less than 100%, so it seems there might be an error in the given density value or the provided densities for amorphous and crystalline polypropylene. Please verify the density values and try again.

If the intended question was to determine the percent crystallinity of a polypropylene sample with a density of 0.913 g/cm³ instead of 1.3 g/cm³, then the working becomes:

% Crystallinity = (0.913 - 0.855) / (0.946 - 0.855) * 100
% Crystallinity = (0.058) / (0.091) * 100

% Crystallinity ≈ 0.6374 * 100

% Crystallinity ≈ 63.74%

In this case, based on the provided answer choices, the correct answer would be (B) 64.
