P: Magnetic particle inspection is suitable for detecting surface cracks in not only austenitic but also in martensitic steels. P-2 is hence incorrect.
Q: X-ray radiography can detect the inclusions in steels, but is not suitable for detecting surface cracks. Q-4 is hence incorrect.
R: Dye penetrant testing is used for detecting surface cracks in materials. R-3 is correct as it can identify a hairline crack in aluminium.
S: Ultrasonic testing can be used to detect surface and subsurface flaws in metals. S-1 is not correct, as it is not the suitable option for identifying surface cracks in austenitic stainless steels, which are naturally prone to intergranular corrosion due to carbide precipitation. 

Therefore, option (B) P-4, Q-2, R-1, S-3 is the correct answer.
