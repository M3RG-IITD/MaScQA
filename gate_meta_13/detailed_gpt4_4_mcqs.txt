To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of Gibbs energy and how it relates to nucleation.

Gibbs energy (also called Gibbs free energy) is a thermodynamic potential that measures the maximum reversible work that may be performed by a system at a constant temperature and pressure. It is represented by G and defined as:

G = H - TS

where H is the enthalpy, T is the temperature, and S is the entropy of the system. In a phase transformation or nucleation process, the Gibbs energy change (ΔG) determines the thermodynamic driving force for the process to occur.

Nucleation is the initial step in the phase transformation process where a new phase (solid or liquid) forms within the existing phase (for example, when water vapor condenses into liquid droplets during cloud formation). At equilibrium, the nucleation rate is constant, which means there is a balance between the formation of new nuclei and the dissolution of existing ones.

Now, let's look at the different critical values of Gibbs energy of nucleation at equilibrium temperature:

(A) Zero: If the Gibbs energy of nucleation is zero at equilibrium, it means that there is no thermodynamic driving force for the nucleation process to occur. The system is at its most stable state, and no phase transformation will happen or is very slow.

(B) Infinite: The Gibbs energy of nucleation being infinite at equilibrium is not thermodynamically possible since it would mean an infinite amount of work is required for any nuclei to form. This contradicts the definition of Gibbs energy, which measures the maximum reversible work that may be performed by a system.

(C) Positive: A positive Gibbs energy of nucleation indicates that the system is in a metastable state. While the nucleation process can still occur at this state, the rate of nucleation is significantly lower than if ΔG were negative. The system favours dissolution over nucleation, but a phase transformation can still happen under certain conditions.

(D) Negative: A negative Gibbs energy of nucleation implies that the system is in an unstable state and phase transformation is thermodynamically favoured. At equilibrium, the formation of nuclei is energetically favorable, and the nucleation process will spontaneously proceed.

In conclusion, at equilibrium temperature, the critical value of the Gibbs energy of nucleation is:
