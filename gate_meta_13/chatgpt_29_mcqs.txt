The direction [110] is the diagonal of a face-centered cubic (FCC) unit cell. The linear density along this direction is equal to the number of atoms divided by the length of the direction. For an FCC unit cell, there are 4 atoms located at the corners of a square and one atom located at the center of the square. The length of the diagonal of the square is given by:

$d = \sqrt{2}a$

where a is the edge length of the square. Therefore, the linear density along the [110] direction is:

$\rho_{[110]} = \frac{4 + 1}{\sqrt{2}a} = \frac{5\sqrt{2}}{a}$

The (100) plane of an FCC unit cell contains one atom per unit cell and has an area of:

$A_{(100)} = a^2$

Therefore, the packing density of the (100) plane is:

$\frac{\text{Number of atoms in } (100)\text{ plane}}{\text{Area of }(100)\text{ plane}} = \frac{1}{a^2}$

Substituting $a = \frac{5\sqrt{2}}{\rho_{[110]}}$ gives:

$\frac{1}{a^2} = \frac{\rho_{[110]}^2}{50} = \frac{25}{2\rho_{[110]}^2}$

Substituting $\rho_{[110]} = \frac{5\sqrt{2}}{a}$ gives:

$\frac{1}{a^2} = \frac{25}{2}\left(\frac{a^2}{50}\right) = \frac{a^2}{4}$

Solving for $a^2$ gives:

$a^2 = \frac{10}{3}$

Substituting this value of $a^2$ into the expression for the packing density gives:

$\frac{1}{a^2} = \boxed{(C) \ 0.79}$
