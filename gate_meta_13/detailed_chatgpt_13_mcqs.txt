In an Ellingham diagram, the Gibbs free energy of formation of metal oxides are plotted against temperature. The slope of the line at any given point on the diagram gives the enthalpy of the reaction, while the line crossing the x-axis represents the temperature at which the reduction reaction becomes spontaneous.

In this case, we are given that the C-CO line intersects the M-MO line at a temperature $T_1$, and the M′-M′O line at a higher temperature $T_2$. This means that at temperatures below $T_1$, carbon cannot reduce either MO or M′O, because the Gibbs free energy of the oxides is too low for the reaction to be spontaneous.

At temperatures between $T_1$ and $T_2$, carbon can reduce MO, but not M′O. This is because the Gibbs free energy of the M-MO reaction becomes more negative than that of the C-CO reaction in this temperature range, making the reduction of MO spontaneous. However, the Gibbs free energy of the M′-M′O reaction is still too low for the reaction to occur.

Above $T_2$, both MO and M′O can be reduced by carbon, because the Gibbs free energy of the M′-M′O reaction becomes more negative than that of the C-CO reaction. Therefore, the answer is (B) both MO and M′O can be reduced by carbon at temperatures between $T_1$ and $T_2$.
