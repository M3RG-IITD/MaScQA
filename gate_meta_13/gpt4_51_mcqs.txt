For a regular solution, the enthalpy of mixing can be expressed as:

$ΔH^(mix)$ = Ω * $χ_(Cu)$ * $χ_(Zn)$

where Ω is the solution parameter. Now, we can compare this expression with the given expression:

-19250 * $χ_(Cu)$ * $χ_(Zn)$ = Ω * $χ_(Cu)$ * $χ_(Zn)$

Since the expressions are equal, the solution parameter Ω must be equal to -19250 J/mol. So the correct answer is:

[-19250]
