Brazing is a process of joining two or more pieces of metal by heating the base metal and melting the filler metal at a higher temperature but below the melting point of the base metal. The filler metal flows in between the two metal pieces and bonds them when it solidifies. For a good quality brazing, the molten filler alloy should have the following properties:

A) Low contact angle with the base metal: Contact angle is the angle between the molten filler metal and the base metal. A low contact angle means that the filler metal wets the base metal and spreads over the surface, forming a strong bond. Therefore, A is incorrect.

B) Low density: The density of the molten filler metal should be lower than that of the base metal to facilitate the flow and penetration of the filler metal into the joint. Therefore, B is incorrect.

C) High surface tension: Surface tension is the tendency of the liquid to minimize its surface area. A high surface tension guarantees that the molten filler metal will form a coherent droplet and will not spread over the surface uncontrollably. Therefore, C is correct.

D) High viscosity: Viscosity is the measure of the resistance of the liquid to flow. A high viscosity will hinder the flow and penetration of the filler metal into the joint, making it difficult to achieve a strong bond. Therefore, D is incorrect.

In conclusion, the correct answer is (C) high surface tension.
