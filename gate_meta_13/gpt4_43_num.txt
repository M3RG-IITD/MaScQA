To calculate the aperture size of a 200 mesh sieve, we need to know the number of meshes per inch (in this case, it's 200) and the wire diameter (53 µm).

The aperture size can be calculated using the formula:

Aperture size = (25,400 µm/inch) / Mesh number - Wire diameter

So, for this problem:

Aperture size = (25,400 µm/inch) / 200 - 53

Aperture size = 127 µm - 53

Aperture size = 74 µm

The aperture size of the 200 mesh sieve is 74 µm.

The correct answer is [74].
