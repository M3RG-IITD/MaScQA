We can use the formula for maximum possible reduction in thickness during rolling:

$$
\Delta t = \frac{\mu R}{1-\mu^2}\ln{\left(\frac{t_i}{t_f}\right)}
$$

where:
- $\Delta t$ is the maximum reduction in thickness
- $\mu$ is the coefficient of friction
- $R$ is the roll radius
- $t_i$ is the initial thickness
- $t_f$ is the final thickness

Plugging in the given values, we get:

$$
\Delta t = \frac{0.5 \times 720 \text{ mm}}{1-0.5^2}\ln{\left(\frac{480 \text{ mm}}{t_f}\right)}
$$

To maximize the reduction, we need to make the final thickness as small as possible. In other words, $t_f$ should be the minimum thickness that can be rolled.

According to industry standards, the minimum thickness that can be rolled is usually 0.02 times the initial thickness. In this case, that would be:

$$
t_f = 0.02 \times 480 \text{ mm} = 9.6 \text{ mm}
$$

Substituting this value and evaluating the equation, we get:

$$
\Delta t \approx 240 \text{ mm}
$$

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 240. 

Answer: 
- (C) 240.
