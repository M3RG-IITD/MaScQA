To solve this question, let's first understand the permeability of burden in an ironmaking blast furnace and the effects of the given factors on it.

Permeability of burden in an ironmaking blast furnace measures the ease with which gases flow through the packed bed of solid material. Improved permeability allows better gas and solid interaction and smoother operation, resulting in increased productivity and reduced fuel consumption.

Now let's analyze the given options one by one:

A) Fine charge: Using fine charge in the furnace can have negative effects on permeability as fine particles can cause congestion or channeling in the packed bed, reducing the overall gas flow. Therefore, fine charge is not a good option to improve permeability.

B) Agglomerated charge: Agglomerated charges, such as sinter or pellets, are the result of combining small iron ore particles and other materials into larger, more porous units. These agglomerates have better permeability and facilitate easy gas flow due to their larger size and fewer fine particles that can clog up the furnace. Therefore, using agglomerated charge improves the permeability of burden in an ironmaking blast furnace.

C) Oxygen enriched air blast: Enriched air blast provides more oxygen in the furnace, increasing the combustion efficiency and faster reaction. While this can improve the overall productivity, it doesn't directly influence the permeability of the solid bed.

D) Pulverized coal injection (PCI) through the tuyeres: PCI involves injecting fine coal particles into the furnace, which can replace some coke in the blast furnace. While this method can help in reducing coke consumption, it doesn't inherently increase the permeability of the burden.

Hence, the correct answer is:
