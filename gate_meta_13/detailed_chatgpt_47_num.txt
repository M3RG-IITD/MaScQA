First, we need to calculate the terminal velocity of the alumina particle using Stokes law:

$v_t = \frac{2r^2(\rho_p - \rho_f)g}{9\eta}$

where $r$ is the radius of the particle, $\rho_p$ is the density of the particle, $\rho_f$ is the density of the fluid, $\eta$ is the viscosity of the fluid, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.

Converting the diameter of the particle to radius:

$r = 25\times10^{-6}$ m

Plugging in the values:

$v_t = \frac{2(25\times10^{-6})^2((3650-7000) kg/m^3)(9.81 m/s^2)}{9(6\times10^{-3} kg/m/s)} = -0.00406 m/s$

Note that the negative sign here just indicates that the particle is moving in the opposite direction of gravity, i.e. upwards.

Next, we can use the following kinematic equation to calculate the time ($t$) for the particle to travel a distance ($d$) at a constant velocity:

$d = \frac{1}{2}at^2 + v_{t}t$

where $a$ is the acceleration of the particle, which is equal to $g$ in this case since the particle is falling in the opposite direction of gravity.

We can rearrange this equation to solve for $t$:

$t = \frac{-v_t \pm \sqrt{v_t^2 - 4(0.5)(-g)(-d)}}{2(-g)}$

Taking the positive root since time cannot be negative:

$t = \frac{-(-0.00406) + \sqrt{(-0.00406)^2 - 4(0.5)(-9.81)(-2)}}{2(-9.81)} = 53.8$ seconds.

So the time required for the alumina particle to float to the surface from a depth of 2m would be 53.8 seconds (rounded to three significant figures).

Answer: 

- 53.8 s
