Austenite stabilizers are elements that, when added to steel, promote the formation and stability of the face-centered cubic (FCC) phase known as austenite. These elements generally have a large solubility in austenite and can expand the temperature range where austenite exists, making it more stable.

Let's analyze each option:

A) Nitrogen: Nitrogen is an interstitial element that dissolves in both ferrite and austenite. When soluble nitrogen is added to steel, it can expand the range of temperatures where austenite is stable. Therefore, nitrogen is an austenite stabilizer.

B) Molybdenum: Molybdenum in steel acts as a carbide-forming element and increases the hardenability of steel. It improves the steel's resistance to creep, and is used in high-temperature applications. However, it is not an austenite stabilizer.

C) Vanadium: Like molybdenum, vanadium is also a carbide-forming element, and it is used to increase the steel's strength through precipitation hardening. It refines the grain size and improves the steel's resistance to wear and fatigue. Vanadium is not an austenite stabilizer.

D) Tungsten: Tungsten is a carbide-forming addition as well, and it is used to improve high-temperature strength and hardness in steels. Similar to molybdenum and vanadium, tungsten is not an austenite stabilizer.

Based on this analysis, only nitrogen (A) can be considered an austenite stabilizer. Therefore, the correct answer is:
