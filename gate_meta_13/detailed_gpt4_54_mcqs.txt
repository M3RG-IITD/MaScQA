We are given an edge dislocation in α-Fe. To find the modulus of the Burger's vector, we need to first recall the definition of an edge dislocation and Burgers vector.

An edge dislocation is a slight defect in the crystal lattice arrangement of a material. In an edge dislocation, the atoms are displaced from the ideal lattice positions, causing a change in the mechanical properties of the material. 

A Burgers vector (b) is a vector that describes the magnitude and direction of the lattice distortion resulting from a dislocation, and it is usually expressed as a multiple of the lattice constant, which is the length of the unit vectors in the crystal lattice. 

Now, we are given the atomic diameter of the iron atom, which is 0.25 nm. In a crystal lattice with edge dislocation, the Burgers vector is equal to the distance between the dislocated planes, which is equal to the atomic diameter in face-centered cubic (FCC) structure, such as in α-Fe.

Hence, the modulus of the Burgers vector (|b|) is equal to the atomic diameter of the iron atom.

|b| = 0.25 nm

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 0.25.

Solution:

[0.25]
