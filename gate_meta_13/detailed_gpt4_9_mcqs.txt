To answer this question, we need to understand the differences between engineering stress-strain curve and true stress-strain curve.

Engineering stress is defined as the applied force divided by the original cross-sectional area of the material:
Engineering stress = Force / Original cross-sectional area

Engineering strain, on the other hand, is defined as the change in length divided by the original length:
Engineering strain = (Final length - Original length) / Original length

True stress is defined as the force divided by the instantaneous or updated cross-sectional area of the material, which changes during deformation:
True stress = Force / Instantaneous cross-sectional area

True strain is defined as the natural logarithm of the ratio of instantaneous length to the original length:
True strain = ln(Instantaneous length / Original length)

During a tensile test of a ductile material, the following behaviors can be observed:

1. As the material undergoes plastic deformation, its cross-sectional area decreases. This means that the true stress will always be greater than the engineering stress, as the area used in the calculation for true stress becomes smaller.

2. As the material is subjected to further plastic deformation, the difference between engineering strain and true strain increases. This is because engineering strain is calculated using the original length, while true strain uses the instantaneous length. At the same time, true strain accounts for the accumulated plastic deformation history.

Taking these key differences into account, we can now determine the correct answer.

(A) lies above and to the left: Since true stress will always be greater than the engineering stress and true strain will always be greater than engineering strain, the true stress-true strain curve will always lie above the engineering stress-engineering strain curve. Additionally, since the true strain accounts for more accumulated plastic deformation, it will be greater than engineering strain, making the true stress-true strain curve to the left of the engineering stress-engineering strain curve.

(B) lies below and to the right: Incorrect because the true stress-strain curve will be above and to the left, as described in (A).

(C) crosses the engineering stress-engineering strain curve: Incorrect because the true stress-strain curve will always lie above the engineering stress-engineering strain curve, as explained in (A).

(D) is identical: Incorrect because the true stress-strain curve will not be the same as the engineering stress-engineering strain curve. The true stress-strain curve will always be above and to the left due to the differences in stress and strain calculations.

So, the correct answer is:

[A]
