We are given four conditions in a roasting process and our task is to identify the conditions that favor the formation of sulphate from metal sulphide concentrates. Let's analyze each condition.

P. High temperature:
High temperature in a roasting process can promote the oxidation of sulphide minerals, including the formation of sulphate. So, high temperature can be a condition that favors the formation of sulphate.

Q. High partial pressure of oxygen:
In roasting, metal sulphide concentrates react with oxygen to form metal oxides and sulphur dioxide ($SO_2$). A higher partial pressure of oxygen can drive the oxidation reaction further, which can ultimately lead to the formation of sulphate ($SO_4^{2-}$) ions. Therefore, a high partial pressure of oxygen can be a condition that favors the formation of sulphate.

R. Use of excess air:
Excess air in a roasting process can provide additional oxygen for the reactions, promoting the oxidation of metal sulphides and the formation of sulphates. So, the use of excess air can be a condition that favors the formation of sulphate.

S. High partial pressure of $SO_3$:
$SO_3$ can react with water to form sulphuric acid (H2SO4). The presence of H2SO4 in the roasting process can promote the formation of sulphate ions ($SO_4^{2-}$) by reacting with metal oxides formed in the roasting process. Therefore, a high partial pressure of $SO_3$ can be a condition that favors the formation of sulphate.

Now, after analyzing each condition, let's check which of the given options is the right one:

(A) P, R and S: These conditions (high temperature, use of excess air, and high partial pressure of $SO_3$) all favor sulphate formation, so this could be the correct choice.

(B) P, Q and R: These conditions (high temperature, high partial pressure of oxygen, and use of excess air) all favor sulphate formation, so this could also be the correct choice.

(C) Q and S: These conditions (high partial pressure of oxygen, and high partial pressure of $SO_3$) favor sulphate formation, but this choice is missing the high temperature (P) and the use of excess air (R), which also favor sulphate formation.

(D) R and S: These conditions (use of excess air and high partial pressure of $SO_3$) favor sulphate formation, but this choice is missing the high temperature (P) and high partial pressure of oxygen (Q), which also favor sulphate formation.

After evaluating each option, the conditions that favor the sulphate formation from metal sulphide concentrates are:

- High temperature (P)
- High partial pressure of oxygen (Q)
- Use of excess air (R)
- High partial pressure of $SO_3$ (S)

So the correct answer is a combination of options (A) and (B). The reason is that these choices include all the conditions that favor the formation of sulphate from the metal sulphide concentrates:

[P, R, and S] âˆª [P, Q, and R] = [P, Q, R, and S]

So the correct answer is: [P, Q, R, and S]
