The roasting process involves heating of metal sulphide ores to convert them to their respective oxides. In the case of sulphide ores, the roasting process may lead to the formation of metal sulphates. The conditions that favour sulfate formation are as follows:

P. High temperature: The rate of reaction increases with an increase in temperature. Sulfur dioxide ($SO_2$) formed during roasting gets oxidized to $SO_3$ at high temperatures.

Q. High partial pressure of oxygen: The presence of oxygen is essential for the oxidation of $SO_2$ to $SO_3$. Therefore, a high partial pressure of oxygen is required to favour the sulfate formation.

R. Use of excess air: The supply of excess air ensures that the concentration of oxygen remains high and the concentration of $SO_2$ remains low. This ensures that $SO_2$ gets oxidized to $SO_3$ and there is a higher chance of sulfate formation.

S. High partial pressure of $SO_3$: A high partial pressure of $SO_3$ favours the formation of sulfates. This is because a high concentration of $SO_3$ promotes the reaction between metal oxides and $SO_3$ to form sulfates.

Therefore, the set of conditions that favour sulphate formation from metal sulphide concentrates are: (A) P, R and S.
