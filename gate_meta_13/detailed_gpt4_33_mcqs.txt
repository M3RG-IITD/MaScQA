To solve this problem, we can use the Hall-Petch Equation, which describes the relationship between the yield strength of a material, its grain size, and material properties. The equation is:

σ_y = σ_0 + k * d^(-1/2)

Where σ_y is the yield strength, σ_0 is the material-dependent constant representing the lattice resistance to dislocation movement, k is the Hall-Petch coefficient, and d is the grain size.

First, let's rewrite the given information in the problem using the Hall-Petch Equation:

1) σ_y1 = 100 MPa, d1 = 64 µm
2) σ_y2 = 145 MPa, d2 = 25 µm
3) d3 = 36 µm (The unknown grain size whose strength we need to find)

Now, let's plug in the values from 1) and 2) into the Hall-Petch equation:

1) 100 = σ_0 + k * (64)^(-1/2)
2) 145 = σ_0 + k * (25)^(-1/2)

Now, we have a system of two linear equations with two unknowns, σ_0 and k. First, let's solve for k in terms of σ_0:

(25)^(-1/2) * k = 45 - σ_0
k = (45 - σ_0) * (25)^(1/2)

Now, we can substitute this expression for k back into Equation 1):

100 = σ_0 + ((45 - σ_0) * (25)^(1/2)) * (64)^(-1/2)

Solving for σ_0:

100 = σ_0 + (45 - σ_0) * (5/8)
100 = σ_0 + (225 - 5σ_0) / 8
800 = 8σ_0 + 225 - 5σ_0
575 = 3σ_0
σ_0 ≈ 191.67

Now that we have σ_0, let's plug it into the expression for k we derived earlier:

k = (45 - 191.67) * (25)^(1/2)
k ≈ -733.33

Finally, we can plug in the values of σ_0 and k and d3 into the Hall-Petch Equation to find the yield strength:

σ_y3 = σ_0 + k * d3^(-1/2)
σ_y3 = 191.67 - 733.33 * (36)^(-1/2)
σ_y3 ≈ 125 MPa

So, the yield strength of the metal with a grain size of 36 µm is approximately 125 MPa, which corresponds to answer (B).

Correct answer: [125]
