Group I comprises four metals: Ni, Th, Pb, and Sn. Group II has four ores: Monazite, Cassiterite, Penlandite, and Galena. 

Now we need to match the metal with the corresponding ore. For this, we need to know which metal is found in which ore. 

Ni stands for Nickel, which is mined from Penlandite (Ni, Fe)9S8. 

Th stands for Thorium, which is not a metal ore. 

Pb stands for Lead, which is obtained from Galena (PbS). 

Sn stands for Tin, which is obtained from Cassiterite (SnO2). 

Now, matching the metals from Group I with the ores from Group II, we get:

P-4 (Lead is obtained from Galena)
Q-3 (There is no Thorium in the given list so no option can be selected for Q) 
R-1 (Nickel is obtained from Penlandite) 
S-2 (Tin is obtained from Cassiterite) 

Therefore, the correct answer is option (B) P-4, Q-2, R-1, S-2.
