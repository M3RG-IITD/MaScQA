P: Orange-peel effect - This is due to uneven paint application and drying. The surface appears to have the texture of an orange peel.

Q: Chevron cracking - This is caused by excessive shear stresses in the material during deep drawing process.

R: Flash - This is a thin fin or projection formed at the parting line of a casting. It is formed due to the leakage of molten metal during the casting process.

S: Undercut - This is caused by faulty tool design or improper machining process. An undercut is a recessed area on the surface of the material.

Based on the above explanations, we can match the defects with their corresponding manufacturing processes as follows:

P-2 (Orange-peel effect is commonly seen in deep drawing process)

Q-1 (Chevron cracking is caused by excessive shear stresses during extrusion)

R-4 (Flash is formed during the casting process)

S-3 (Undercut is caused by faulty tool design or improper machining process during arc welding)

Therefore, the correct option is (A) P-1, Q-2, R-4, S-3.
