Given, 
σ = 1050 × ε^0.25

True stress (σ) is given by, 

σ = F/A₀ , where F is the applied load and A₀ is the original cross-sectional area of the material.

True strain (ε) is given by, 

ε = ln(L/L₀) , where L is the instantaneous length of the material and L₀ is the original length of the material.

Uniform strain is defined as the change in length of a material per unit length. Mathematically,

Uniform strain (ΔL/L₀) = ε

We need to find the maximum true uniform strain that can be imparted to the material.

From the given expression, 

σ = 1050 × ε^0.25

We can write the expression for true strain as, 

ε = (σ/1050) ^ 4

The maximum true uniform strain occurs when the material reaches its maximum true stress. So, we need to find the maximum true stress that the material can withstand. 

Differentiating σ w.r.t. ε, we get 

dσ/dε = 2625/4 × ε^-0.75

For maximum true stress, dσ/dε = 0

=> 2625/4 × ε^-0.75 = 0

=> ε = 0

So, the maximum true stress that the material can withstand is σ = 1050 × 0^0.25 = 0

Therefore, the maximum true uniform strain that can be imparted to the material is also 0.
