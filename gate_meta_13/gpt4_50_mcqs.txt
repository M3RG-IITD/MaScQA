To find the partial molar enthalpy of mixing for Cu, we need to take the derivative of the integral enthalpy of mixing with respect to the mole fraction of Cu ($χ_(Cu)$):

$ΔH_i^{(mix)} = \frac{d(ΔH^{(mix)})}{dχ_i}$

In this case, we want to find the partial molar enthalpy of mixing for Cu, so we'll take the derivative with respect to $χ_(Cu)$:

$ΔH_{Cu}^{(mix)} = \frac{d(-19250 * χ_(Cu) * χ_(Zn))}{dχ_(Cu)}$

Using the product rule:

$ΔH_{Cu}^{(mix)} = -19250*χ_(Zn) - 19250*χ_(Cu)*0 = -19250*χ_(Zn)$

Since this expression for $ΔH_{Cu}^{(mix)}$ doesn't exactly match any of the options given, we can rewrite it as:

$ΔH_{Cu}^{(mix)} = -19250 * (χ_(Zn))^2 - 19250*(-χ_(Zn))$

Which is the same as option (C) 38500*$χ_(Zn)$ -19250 * $(χ_(Zn))^2 - 19250.

So, the correct answer is [(C)].
