To determine the maximum possible reduction in a hot-rolled slab, we can use the following formula:

Maximum reduction = µ * roll diameter

where µ is the coefficient of friction and the roll diameter is given in millimeters.

Plugging in the given values:

Maximum reduction = 0.5 * 720 mm = 360 mm

So the correct answer is (D) 360.

Therefore, the answer is [360].
