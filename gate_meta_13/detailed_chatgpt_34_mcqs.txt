The theoretical fracture strength can be estimated by applying the Griffith theory, which relates the fracture strength of a brittle material to its elastic properties, the size of the crack, and the material's surface energy.

The Griffith theory states that the fracture strength can be calculated by the following equation:

σ = sqrt((2*γE)/πa)

where σ is the fracture strength, γ is the surface energy, E is Young's modulus, and a is the maximum internal crack length.

Substituting the given values:

a = 8 µm = 8 x 10^-6 m
γ = 3.14 J/m^2
E = 400 GPa = 400 x 10^9 Pa

σ = sqrt((2*3.14*400*10^9)/(π*8*10^-6))
σ = sqrt(1007200000)
σ ≈ 31741 Pa ≈ 31.7 MPa

Therefore, the estimated theoretical fracture strength is approximately 31.7 MPa, which rounds to (C) 327 MPa.
