To calculate the time required for alumina particles to float to the surface, we can use Stokes' Law:

t = (2 * a^2 * ρ_p * h) / (9 * η * (ρ_p - ρ_f))

Where t is the time (in seconds), a is the radius of the alumina particle, ρ_p is the density of alumina, h is the depth, η is the viscosity of steel, and ρ_f is the density of steel.

First, we convert the diameter of the alumina particles to meters and then calculate the radius (a).
Diameter = 50 µm = 50 * 10^(-6) m
Radius (a) = Diameter / 2 = 25 * 10^(-6) m

Now, we can plug the values into Stokes' Law formula:
t = (2 * (25 * 10^(-6))^2 * 3650 * 2) / (9 * 6 * 10^(-3) * (3650 - 7000))

t = (2 * (6.25 * 10^(-10)) * 3650 * 2) / (9 * 6 * 10^(-3) * (-3350))

t = (4.525 * 10^(-7)) / (-180.9 * 10^(-3))

t = -0.0025

The result is negative, which means the particles would not float to the surface due to the lower density of alumina than steel. This implies that alumina might get trapped instead of floating to the surface.

The answer is that the particles will not float to the surface. Therefore, the list with the correct answer is:
