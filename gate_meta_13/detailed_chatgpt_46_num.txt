We can use the equation for critical crack length in Mode I stress:

$a = \frac{K_{1c}^2}{\sigma^2_{max}}$

where $a$ is the critical crack length, $K_{1c}$ is the fracture toughness of the material, and $\sigma_{max}$ is the maximum stress at the crack tip.

Substituting the given values:

$a = \frac{(45 MPaâˆšm)^2}{(400 MPa)^2} = \frac{2025}{160000} m = 0.01265625 m = 12.65625 mm$

Therefore, the critical internal crack length is 12.65625 mm.

Answer: 

- 12.65625 mm.
