To find the thickness of the boundary layer, we need to find the value of y at which the velocity $V_x$ equals 0.99 times the free stream velocity $V_\infty$. The equation is as follows:

$V_x = 0.99V_\infty$

We know $V_x = 0.5y - 0.5y^3$. Substituting, we have:

$0.5y - 0.5y^3 = 0.99V_\infty$

Now, let's assume that $y = \delta$ and solve for it. It may be difficult to solve the equation analytically, so we can use numerical techniques to get the answer.

Let's try using the Newton-Raphson method to find the value of $\delta$, given we know the value of $V_\infty$:

Step 1: Let $f(\delta) = 0.5\delta - 0.5\delta^3 - 0.99V_\infty$.

Step 2: Calculate the first derivative of f with respect to $\delta$. $f'(\delta) = 0.5 - 1.5\delta^2$.

Step 3: Guess a value for $\delta$, let's say $\delta_0 = 1$ (it can be any reasonable value).

Step 4: Calculate the next value of $\delta$ using the formula: $\delta_1 = \delta_0 - \frac{f(\delta_0)}{f'(\delta_0)}$.

Step 5: Repeat Step 4 until the value of $\delta$ converges within the desired accuracy (in this case, two decimal places).

Since we're missing the value of $V_\infty$, we cannot complete the Newton-Raphson method to obtain a numerical value for the thickness of the boundary layer at $x = x_1$. However, if the value of $V_\infty$ is given, we could follow the above steps to obtain the result rounded to two decimal places.

Therefore, the thickness of the boundary layer at $x = x_1$ cannot be determined without the given value of $V_\infty$. When the $V_\infty$ value is given, you can follow the above steps to calculate $\delta$.
