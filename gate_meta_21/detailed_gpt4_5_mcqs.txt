To answer this question, let's understand each of the manufacturing processes mentioned in the options and determine which one is suitable for making single crystal turbine blades of nickel-based superalloys for aero-engines.

A) Investment casting:
Investment casting, also known as lost-wax casting or precision casting, is a process where a wax pattern is coated with a refractory ceramic material. This ceramic mold is then heated, hardening the ceramic and melting out the wax, leaving a cavity with the desired shape. Molten metal is then poured into the cavity, solidifying and forming the component. Investment casting can produce parts with complex geometries and excellent surface finishes.

B) Die casting:
Die casting is a high-pressure metal casting process where molten metal is forced into a mold cavity under high pressure. The molds, or dies, are usually made from hardened steel. This process allows the production of components with uniform dimensions and limited porosity. However, die casting usually requires post-processing to achieve the desired surface finish and dimensional accuracy.

C) Squeeze casting:
Squeeze casting, also known as liquid metal forging or pressure infiltration, is a process where molten metal is forced into a preheated die with a certain pressure applied during solidification. Squeeze casting can produce parts with good dimensional accuracy, low porosity, and improved mechanical properties compared to conventional casting processes. 

D) Directional solidification:
Directional solidification is a controlled solidification process that produces metal components with a preferred crystallographic orientation or grain structure. This is achieved by controlling the heat transfer during solidification, creating a temperature gradient that promotes the growth of single crystals or aligned grains. Directional solidification can improve the mechanical properties, fatigue resistance, and resistance to high temperatures of the produced components.

Now, let's analyze which process is suitable for manufacturing single crystal turbine blades of nickel-based superalloys for aero-engines:

Single crystal turbine blades are advantageous for aero-engines due to their superior resistance to fatigue and high-temperature operations. A manufacturing process that can produce single crystals or highly aligned grains is required to achieve these properties.

Investment casting, die casting, and squeeze casting can produce components with intricate geometries and good surface finishes, but they don't inherently provide the desired crystallographic orientation or grain structure necessary for single crystal turbine blades.

Directional solidification, on the other hand, is specifically designed to produce metal components with controlled crystallographic orientations and structures. Using this process, single crystal turbine blades can be made with the desired microstructural characteristics and improved mechanical properties ideal for aero-engines.

So, the correct answer is:
