First, we need to determine ΔG° for the overall reaction using the given equations:
ΔG° = ΔG°f($Cu_2S$) + ΔG°f($O_2$) - (ΔG°f(2Cu) + ΔG°f($SO_2$))
Note that we only need to use half of the ΔG° equation for $S_2$ since we have only used half a mole in the first equation:
ΔG° = (-79.3 kJ/mol + 0 kJ/mol) - (0 kJ/mol + 292 kJ/mol)
ΔG° = -371.3 kJ/mol

Next, we can use the relationship between ΔG° and the equilibrium constant (K) at a given temperature to solve for ln(K):
ΔG° = -RTlnK
ln(K) = -ΔG°/RT
ln(K) = -(-371.3 kJ/mol)/(8.314 J/mol-K * 973 K)
ln(K) = 0.0474

We can use the value of ln(K) to determine ln($P_{O_2}$/$P_{SO_2}$) using the stoichiometry of the balanced equation:
2Cu(s) + $SO_2$(g) = $Cu_2$S(s) + $O_2$(g)
ln($P_{O_2}$/$P_{SO_2}$) = (2)(ln(K))
ln($P_{O_2}$/$P_{SO_2}$) = 2(0.0474)
ln($P_{O_2}$/$P_{SO_2}$) = 0.095

Therefore, the value of ln($P_{O_2}$/$P_{SO_2}$) at 973K is 0.095.
