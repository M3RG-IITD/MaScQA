The true strain (ε) can be calculated using the formula:

ε = ln(h_initial/h_final)

where h_initial is the initial height and h_final is the final height after reduction.

Given a 60% height reduction, we can find the final height:

h_final = h_initial * (1 - 0.60)

Let's assume the initial height (h_initial) is 1 unit (to make the calculation simple). Then,

h_final = 1 * (1 - 0.60) = 1 * 0.40 = 0.40 units

Now, we can find the true strain:

ε = ln(1/0.40) = ln(2.5) ≈ 0.92 (rounded to 2 decimal places)

So, the true strain for 60% height reduction of a sample subjected to hot forging is approximately 0.92.

Answer: [0.92]
