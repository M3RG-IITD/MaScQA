We are given the standard reduction potential (E°) for the half-cell reaction Ni⁺²/Ni and the Faraday's constant (F). We need to find the standard molar Gibbs free energy (µ°) for Ni⁺² at 298 K.

The relationship between standard reduction potential and standard molar Gibbs free energy is given by the following equation:

µ° = -nFE°

where µ° is the standard molar Gibbs free energy, n is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction, F is the Faraday's constant (96485 C mol⁻¹), and E° is the standard reduction potential.

For the half-cell reaction, Ni⁺² + 2e⁻ → Ni, the number of electrons transferred, n, is 2.

First, let's plug in the given values into the equation:

µ° = -2 × 96500 C mol⁻¹ × (-0.25 V),

It's important to note that 1 V = 1 J C⁻¹, so we can convert the volts to joules per coulomb:

µ° = -2 × 96500 C mol⁻¹ × (-0.25 J C⁻¹).

Now, let's perform the calculation:

µ° = -2 × 96500 × -0.25
µ° = 2 × 96500 × 0.25
µ° = 48250 × 0.5
µ° = 24125 J mol⁻¹

Rounding off to the nearest integer, the standard molar Gibbs free energy (µ°) for Ni⁺² at 298 K is 24125 J mol⁻¹.

So, the correct answer is [24125].
