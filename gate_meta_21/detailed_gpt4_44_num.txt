1. First, we need to calculate the initial volume of the gas. We have the initial pressure (P1 = 10 atm = 10 x 101325 Pa), the temperature (T1 = 300 K), and the ideal gas constant (R = 8.314 J/mol K). We can use the ideal gas equation:

PV = nRT
=> V1 = nRT / P1

2. Since we are given one mole of the gas, n = 1.

V1 = (1 * 8.314 * 300) / (10 * 101325)
=> V1 ≈ 0.00247 m^3

3. Next, we find the adiabatic exponent (γ) using the given molar heat capacity at constant pressure ($C_p$ = 2.5R) and the molar heat capacity at constant volume ($C_v$ = $C_p$ - R).

γ = $C_p$ / $C_v$
=> γ = (2.5R) / (2.5R - R)

4. Substitute the value of R.

γ = (2.5 * 8.314) / (2.5 * 8.314 - 8.314)
=> γ ≈ 1.4

5. Now, we can find the final temperature (T2) using the equation for reversible adiabatic expansion:

(T1 × P1^(γ-1)) = (T2 × P2^(γ-1))

6. Substitute the values:

(300 × (10 * 101325)^(1.4 - 1)) = (T2 × (1 * 101325)^(1.4 - 1))

=> T2 ≈ 194.26 K

7. We can now use the ideal gas equation again to find the final volume (V2):

V2 = nRT2 / P2

=> V2 ≈ 0.0158 m^3

8. To find the work done by the gas during the reversible adiabatic expansion, we can use the following formula:

W = (nR × (T1 - T2)) / (γ - 1)

9. Input the values:

W = (1 * 8.314 × (300 - 194.26)) / (1.4 - 1)

=> W ≈ -1046 J

10. Thus, the work done by the gas during the reversible adiabatic expansion is approximately -1046 J when rounded to the nearest integer.

So, the correct answer is [-1046].
