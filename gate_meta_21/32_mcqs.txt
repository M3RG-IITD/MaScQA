A single crystal aluminium sample is subjected to uniaxial tension along [1 1 2] direction. If the applied tensile stress is 100 MPa and the critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) is 25 MPa, which one of the following slip systems will be activated?
(A) [-1 0 1](1 1 1) (B) [-1 1 0](1 1 1) (C) [1 0 1](1 1 -1) (D) [0 1 1](1 1 -1)
