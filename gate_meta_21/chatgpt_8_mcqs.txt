The FALSE statement for creep deformation is:

(B) Creep resistance decreases with decrease in grain size.

The correct answer list is: 

- (B) Creep resistance decreases with decrease in grain size. 
- (A) The minimum creep rate is obtained in the primary stage (stage I) 
- (C) Coble creep occurs via grain boundary diffusion. 
- (D) Nabarro-Herring creep occurs via lattice diffusion.
