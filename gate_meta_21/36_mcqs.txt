Given: Atomic weight: O = 16, C = 12, N = 14, Fe = 56. All the compositions are in wt.%. 1 ton = 1000 kg. A blast furnace uses hematite ore with 80% $Fe_(2)O_3$ and 20% gangue materials. It uses 600 kg coke per ton of hot metal. The coke contains 85% C and 15%ash. The composition of hot metal is 95.5% Fe and 4.5%C. The weight of iron ore used and slag produced per ton of hot metal respectively, are: (Assume that the gangue materials of the ore and ash content of coke form slag while $Fe_(2)O_3$ in the ore is consumed in making hot metal)
(A) 1705 kg, 431 kg (B) 2131kg, 546 kg (C) 1705kg, 331kg (D) 1500kg, 431kg
