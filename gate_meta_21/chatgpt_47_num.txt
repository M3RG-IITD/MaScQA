We can use the equation:

τ = Gb/λ

where τ is the required shear stress, G is the shear modulus of the material, b is the magnitude of the Burgers vector of the dislocation, and λ is the spacing between the precipitates.

Assuming G and b remain constant, we can write:

τ1/τ2 = λ2/λ1

where τ1 and λ1 are the original values, and τ2 and λ2 are the new values.

Substituting the given values, we get:

τ2 = τ1 x λ2/λ1
     = 100 x 0.5/0.2
     = 250 (rounded off to nearest integer)

Therefore, the shear stress required to bow the dislocation line between precipitates with a spacing of 0.5 µm is 250 MPa.

Answer: [250]
