To find the free energy change for the liquid to solid transformation at 1058K, we will use the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation:

ΔG = ΔH - TΔS

Where ΔG is the change in free energy, ΔH is the change in enthalpy, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and ΔS is the change in entropy.

First, we need to find the change in entropy (ΔS). We can use the enthalpy of melting (ΔH) and the melting point temperature (Tm) to find ΔS. 

ΔS = ΔH / Tm = 13400 J mol^(-1) / 1358 K 

ΔS ≈ 9.87 J mol^(-1) K^(-1)

Now we can find the change in free energy (ΔG) at 1058K. 

ΔG = ΔH - TΔS

ΔG = 13400 J mol^(-1) - (1058 K)(9.87 J mol^(-1) K^(-1))

ΔG ≈ -3107 J mol^(-1)

Since the problem asks for the free energy change for the liquid to solid transformation, and we calculated it for the solid to liquid transformation, we need to change the sign of ΔG:

ΔG(liquid to solid) = -ΔG(solid to liquid)

ΔG(liquid to solid) = -(-3107 J mol^(-1))

ΔG(liquid to solid) ≈ 3107 J mol^(-1)

Rounded off to the nearest integer, the change in free energy for the liquid to solid transformation at 1058K is 3107 J mol^(-1).
