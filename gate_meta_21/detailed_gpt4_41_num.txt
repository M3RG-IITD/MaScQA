We'll start by finding the surface area and volume of both the sphere and the cube.

Sphere:

Radius of the sphere (r_s) = 6 cm
Volume of the sphere (V_s) = (4/3)πr_s^3
V_s = (4/3) × π × 6^3 = 288π cm³

Surface area of the sphere (A_s) = 4πr_s^2
A_s = 4 × π × 6^2 = 144π cm²

Cube:

Edge length of the cube (a_c) = 12 cm
Volume of the cube (V_c) = a_c^3
V_c = 12^3 = 1728 cm³

Surface area of the cube (A_c) = 6a_c^2
A_c = 6 × 12^2 = 864 cm²

Now we will use Chvorinov's Rule for solidification time:
t = k × (V/A)^2

where t is the solidification time, k is a constant, V is the volume, and A is the surface area.

We are given the solidification time for the sphere as 60 minutes, and we know the volume and surface area of the sphere. We can use this information to find the constant k.

For the sphere:
t_s = k × (V_s/A_s)^2
60 = k × (288π/144π)^2
60 = k × (2)^2

Solving for k:
k = 60 / 4
k = 15

Now we can calculate the solidification time for the cube using the same constant k.

For the cube:
t_c = k × (V_c/A_c)^2
t_c = 15 × (1728/864)^2
t_c = 15 × (2)^2

t_c = 15 × 4
t_c = 60 minutes

Therefore, the time required to solidify for the cubical casting is 60 minutes.
