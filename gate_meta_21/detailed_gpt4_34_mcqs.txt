To find the shear stress exerted by the fluid on the tube wall, we will first need to calculate the shear rate, which is the derivative of the axial velocity with respect to the radial distance 'r'. 

Given: 
$v_z$ = [ΔP/L]*({$R^2$ - $r^2$}/4µ)

Now, we will find the derivative of $v_z$ with respect to 'r'. 

$\frac{dv_z}{dr} = -\frac{\Delta P}{2L\mu}r$

Using Newton's law of viscosity, we can relate shear stress ($\tau$) and shear rate ($\frac{dv_z}{dr}$) as follows:

$\tau = \mu \frac{dv_z}{dr}$

Now substituting the value of $\frac{dv_z}{dr}$:

$\tau = -\mu \frac{\Delta P}{2L\mu}r$

We can see that the 'µ' terms will cancel out:

$\tau = -\frac{\Delta P}{2L}r$

Now, to find the shear stress at the wall, we will consider the radial distance 'r' to be equal to the radius 'R' of the pipe:

$\tau_{wall} = -\frac{\Delta P}{2L}R$

The negative sign indicates that the shear stress acts opposite to the direction of flow. However, we are interested in the magnitude of the shear stress, which is:

$\tau_{wall} = \frac{\Delta P}{2L}R$

Thus, the correct answer is (A) ΔPR/(2L).
