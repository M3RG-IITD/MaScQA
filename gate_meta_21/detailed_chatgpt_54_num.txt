Given, weight gain is proportional to the square root of time. So we can write,

$W_1 = k\sqrt{t_1}$ ------ (1)

where $W_1$ is the weight gain, $t_1$ is the time duration, and $k$ is the proportionality constant.

Now, we can find the value of $k$ from the given information. When nickel undergoes isothermal oxidation at 800K for a duration of 400s, it results in a weight gain of 2mg $cm^{2}$.

$2 = k\sqrt{400}$

$k = \frac{2}{20}$

$k = 0.1$

So, the equation (1) becomes,

$W_1 = 0.1\sqrt{t_1}$

We need to find the weight gain after a duration of 1600s. Let's call it $W_2$.

$W_2 = 0.1\sqrt{1600}$

$W_2 = 0.1*40$

$W_2 = 4$ mg $cm^{2}$ (rounded off to the nearest integer)

Therefore, the weight gain after a duration of 1600s is 4 mg $cm^{2}$.
