Since the applied tensile stress is greater than the CRSS for aluminium, slip will occur. We need to determine which slip system will be activated using the Schmid Law. 

The Schmid factor (or resolved shear stress) for a slip system is given by:
$$
\tau_s = \sigma \cos \theta \cos \lambda
$$
where $\sigma$ is the applied stress, $\theta$ is the angle between the slip direction and the applied stress direction, and $\lambda$ is the angle between the slip plane and a fixed reference direction. 

We begin by identifying the slip systems that have the [1 1 2] direction as a slip direction. The slip direction is a <110> direction, so we look for slip systems with a <110> direction. Options A and B have a <110> direction in the [-1 0 1] and [-1 1 0] slip directions, respectively. Options C and D have a <110> direction in the [1 0 1] and [0 1 1] slip directions, respectively.

Next, we calculate the Schmid factors for each slip system. We choose the [1 1 2] direction as our reference direction, so we need to determine the angles between each slip plane/direction and the [1 1 2] direction. 

For option A:
- Slip direction: [-1 0 1]
- Angle between slip direction and [1 1 2]: $\theta = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{[-1~0~1]\cdot[1~1~2]}{\left\Vert[-1~0~1]\right\Vert \left\Vert[1~1~2]\right\Vert}\right) \approx 23.2^\circ$
- Slip plane: (1 1 1)
- Angle between slip plane and [1 1 2]: $\lambda = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{[1~1~1]\cdot[1~1~2]}{\left\Vert[1~1~1]\right\Vert \left\Vert[1~1~2]\right\Vert}\right) \approx 32.8^\circ$
- Schmid factor: $\tau_s = (100~\text{MPa})\cos(23.2^\circ)\cos(32.8^\circ) \approx 42.2~\text{MPa}$

For option B:
- Slip direction: [-1 1 0]
- Angle between slip direction and [1 1 2]: $\theta = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{[-1~1~0]\cdot[1~1~2]}{\left\Vert[-1~1~0]\right\Vert \left\Vert[1~1~2]\right\Vert}\right) \approx 45^\circ$
- Slip plane: (1 1 1)
- Angle between slip plane and [1 1 2]: $\lambda = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{[1~1~1]\cdot[1~1~2]}{\left\Vert[1~1~1]\right\Vert \left\Vert[1~1~2]\right\Vert}\right) \approx 32.8^\circ$
- Schmid factor: $\tau_s = (100~\text{MPa})\cos(45^\circ)\cos(32.8^\circ) \approx 35.4~\text{MPa}$

For option C:
- Slip direction: [1 0 1]
- Angle between slip direction and [1 1 2]: $\theta = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{[1~0~1]\cdot[1~1~2]}{\left\Vert[1~0~1]\right\Vert \left\Vert[1~1~2]\right\Vert}\right) \approx 35.3^\circ$
- Slip plane: (1 1 -1)
- Angle between slip plane and [1 1 2]: $\lambda = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{[1~1~-1]\cdot[1~1~2]}{\left\Vert[1~1~-1]\right\Vert \left\Vert[1~1~2]\right\Vert}\right) \approx 45^\circ$
- Schmid factor: $\tau_s = (100~\text{MPa})\cos(35.3^\circ)\cos(45^\circ) \approx 38.3~\text{MPa}$

For option D:
- Slip direction: [0 1 1]
- Angle between slip direction and [1 1 2]: $\theta = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{[0~1~1]\cdot[1~1~2]}{\left\Vert[0~1~1]\right\Vert \left\Vert[1~1~2]\right\Vert}\right) \approx 65.2^\circ$
- Slip plane: (1 1 -1)
- Angle between slip plane and [1 1 2]: $\lambda = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{[1~1~-1]\cdot[1~1~2]}{\left\Vert[1~1~-1]\right\Vert \left\Vert[1~1~2]\right\Vert}\right) \approx 45^\circ$
- Schmid factor: $\tau_s = (100~\text{MPa})\cos(65.2^\circ)\cos(45^\circ) \approx 20.7~\text{MPa}$

Therefore, the slip system with the highest Schmid factor is option A, so the answer is (A) [-1 0 1](1 1 1).
