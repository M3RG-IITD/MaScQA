The critical temperature gradient required to maintain planar solidification front is given by:
$$G_c = \frac{\Delta T}{L}$$
where $\Delta T$ is the temperature difference between the liquidus and solidus lines at the composition of the alloy, and $L$ is the latent heat of fusion. 

From the phase diagram, we can see that the liquidus and solidus lines at 5 wt.% B intersect at a temperature of about 605 K. The latent heat of fusion can be estimated to be about 170 J/g from the diagram. Converting Âµm $s^(-1)$ to m $s^(-1)$, we have the velocity of solidification front as 4 x $10^(-3)m^s(-1)$.

Now, we can calculate the critical temperature gradient:

$$G_c = \frac{\Delta T}{L} = \frac{(606-605)\text{ K}}{170\text{ J/g} \times 0.05\text{ g/cm}^3 \times 10\text{ mm/cm}} \approx 1 \text{ K/mm}$$

Therefore, the answer is 1.
