Unfortunately, there is no image attached to the question. However, based on the information provided, the critical temperature gradient can be calculated using the following equation from solidification theory:

$$ G_c = \dfrac{mDv_f}{L_0C_0} $$

Where:

- $G_c$: critical temperature gradient (in K $mm^(-1)$),
- $m$: slope of the liquidus line (in K $wt.^(-1)$% B),
- $D$: diffusivity of B in liquid (in $m^2s^(-1)$),
- $v_f$: velocity of the solidification front (in $µm$s^(-1)$),
- $L_0$: partition coefficient,
- $C_0$: initial concentration of component B (in wt.%).

To answer this question, we need the values ​​for the slope of the liquidus line (m) and the partition coefficient (L_0) from the phase diagram image. Please provide the image to complete the calculation.
