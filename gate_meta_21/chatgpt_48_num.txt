The given state of plane strain is represented by the stress tensor as follows:

$$\begin{bmatrix}σ_{xx} & 0 & 0\\0 & σ_{yy} & 0\\0 & 0 & 0\end{bmatrix}$$

We know that for a material in a state of plane strain, the Poisson's ratio $(ν)$ is given by:

$$ν=\frac{- ε_{zz}}{ε_{xx}}$$

Since $ε_{zz}=0$, we can rewrite the above equation as:

$$ν=\frac{0}{ε_{xx}}$$

As the ratio of $ε_(zz)/ε_(xx)$ is not given in the question, we cannot determine the value of $ε_{xx}$. However, we can use the relationship between stress and strain for a material in a state of plane strain to relate $σ_(zz)$ to $σ_(xx)$.

The relationship between stress and strain for a material in a state of plane strain is given by:

$$ε_{xx}=\frac{1}{E}\left[σ_{xx}-ν\left(σ_{yy}+σ_{zz}\right)\right]$$

where $E$ is the Young's modulus of the material.

Substituting $ε_(zz)$ = 0, $σ_(xx)$ = $σ_(yy)$ and $ν$ = 0.3 in the above equation, we get:

$$ε_{xx}=\frac{1}{E}\left[σ_{xx}-0.3\left(σ_{xx}\right)\right]=\frac{0.7}{E}σ_{xx}$$

Multiplying both sides by $E/0.7σ_{xx}$, we get:

$$\frac{ε_{xx}}{σ_{xx}}=\frac{E}{0.7σ_{xx}}$$

Since the left-hand side of the above equation represents the strain in the $x$-direction due to the stress in the $x$-direction (i.e., the axial strain), it is equal to the axial tensile strain $(ε_a)$ in the $x$-direction. Therefore, we can rewrite the above equation as:

$$ε_a=\frac{E}{0.7σ_{xx}}σ_{xx}$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$ε_a=\frac{10}{7} \frac{σ_{xx}}{E}$$

Now, we can use the relationship between stress and strain in the $zz$-direction, which is given by:

$$ε_{zz}=\frac{1}{E}\left[σ_{zz}-ν\left(σ_{xx}+σ_{yy}\right)\right]$$

Substituting $ε_(zz)$ = 0, $σ_(xx)$ = $σ_(yy)$ and $ν$ = 0.3 in the above equation, we get:

$$0=σ_{zz}-0.3(2σ_{xx})$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$σ_{zz}=0.6σ_{xx}$$

Therefore, the ratio of $σ_(zz)/σ_(xx)$ is:

$$\frac{σ_{zz}}{σ_{xx}}=\frac{0.6σ_{xx}}{σ_{xx}}=0.6$$

Hence, the required ratio is 0.6.
