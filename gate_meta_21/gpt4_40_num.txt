We need to find the cross-sectional area of the weld. First, we need to calculate the energy provided by the welding machine and then use the heat transfer factor and melting factor to find out how much energy is utilized for melting the metal.

Energy provided by the welding machine (W) = Power (P) × Travel speed (v)

W = 3000 W × 6 mm/s
W = 18000 J/s

Now, let's consider the heat transfer factor and melting factor.

Energy utilized for melting (E_melt) = W × Heat transfer factor × Melting factor

E_melt = 18000 J/s × 0.6 × 0.5
E_melt = 5400 J/s

We know that the unit energy required to melt the metal is 6 J $mm^(-3)$. Therefore, we can find the volume of the metal melted (V_melt) per second using the energy utilized for melting.

V_melt (mm^3) = E_melt (J/s) / Unit energy (J $mm^(-3)$)

V_melt = 5400 J/s / 6 J $mm^(-3)$
V_melt = 900 $mm^3$/s

Since the travel speed is 6 mm/s, we can find the cross-sectional area (A) of the weld using the volume of the metal melted per second.

A (mm^2) = V_melt (mm^3/s) / Travel speed (mm/s)

A = 900 $mm^3$/s / 6 mm/s
A = 150 $mm^2$

Therefore, the cross-sectional area of the weld is approximately 150 $mm^2$.

Answer: [150].
