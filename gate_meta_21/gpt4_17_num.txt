We can calculate the change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) using the equation:

ΔG = ΔH - TΔS

where:
ΔH is the enthalpy change (13400 J mol⁻¹),
T is the temperature (1058K),
ΔS is the entropy change.

We can find the entropy change (ΔS) using the relationship between enthalpy change and melting point temperature (the temperature at which the Gibbs free energy change is zero):

ΔG = 0 = ΔH - T_mΔS

where T_m is the melting point temperature (1358K). Rearranging for ΔS, we get:

ΔS = ΔH / T_m = 13400 J mol⁻¹ / 1358 K ≈ 9.865 J mol⁻¹ K⁻¹

Now, we can find the Gibbs free energy change at 1058K:

ΔG = ΔH - TΔS ≈ 13400 J mol⁻¹ - 1058 K * 9.865 J mol⁻¹ K⁻¹
ΔG ≈ 13400 J mol⁻¹ - 10429.69 J mol⁻¹
ΔG ≈ 2970.31 J mol⁻¹

Rounding off to the nearest integer, the change in Gibbs free energy for the liquid to solid transformation at 1058K is approximately 2970 J mol⁻¹.
