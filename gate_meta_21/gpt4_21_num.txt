To find the Bragg angle for the second reflection, we must first understand the relationship between the Bragg equation, lattice parameters, and crystal structure.

For a FCC crystal, the Bragg equation is given by 

nλ = 2d * sin(θ) 

where n is the order of reflection, λ is the wavelength of the incident X-ray, d is the interplanar spacing, and θ is the Bragg angle.

For a FCC crystal, the interplanar spacing (d) is related to the lattice parameter (a) by:

d = a /√(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)

where h, k, and l are Miller indices of the crystal planes.

For the first reflection in a FCC crystal, the lowest allowed value of (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) is 3 (e.g., the family of {110} planes). Let's denote d1 as the interplanar spacing for the first reflection:

d1 = a / √3

Now we want to find the Bragg angle for the second reflection, where the lowest allowed value of (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) is 4 (e.g., the family of {200} planes). Denote d2 as the interplanar spacing for the second reflection:

d2 = a /√4 = a / 2

Since the incident X-ray wavelength (λ) is the same for all reflections, we can write λ in terms of d1 and d2 for the first and second reflections, respectively:

λ = 2 * d1 * sin(30°) = 2 * d2 * sin(θ2)

Now we can solve for the Bragg angle, θ2, of the second reflection:

sin(θ2) = 2 * d1 * sin(30°) / (2 * d2) = d1 / d2 = (a / √3) / (a / 2) = 2 / √3

θ2 = arcsin(2 / √3)

In degrees, this is:

θ2 ≈ 60.0° (rounded off to one decimal place)

So, the Bragg angle for the second reflection is 60.0°.

The correct answer is [60.0].
