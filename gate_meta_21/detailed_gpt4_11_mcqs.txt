A zeroth order chemical reaction is a reaction in which the rate of the reaction is independent of the concentration of any reactant. The rate law for a zeroth order reaction is given by the equation:

Rate = k

where k is the zero-order rate constant.

Let's analyze each option:

(A) Concentration versus time plot is a straight line.

In a zeroth order reaction, the rate of reaction is constant and does not depend on the concentration of reactants. So, the amount of reactant consumed (or product formed) over time is linear, resulting in a straight line when plotting concentration versus time.

(B) Increase in concentration of reacting species increases the rate of reaction

As mentioned earlier, the rate of a zeroth order reaction is independent of the concentration of reactants. This statement is false, as the rate of the reaction does not change with increasing concentrations of the reactants in a zeroth order reaction.

(C) Half-life depends on the initial concentration and zero-order rate constant.

The half-life of a zeroth order reaction is defined as the time it takes for the concentration of a reactant to decrease to half its initial concentration. The equation for the half-life of a zeroth order reaction is:

t_half = [A_initial] / (2 * k)

Where [A_initial] is the initial concentration of the reactant and k is the zero-order rate constant. As we can see, the half-life depends on both the initial concentration and the zero-order rate constant.

(D) Rate of reaction depends on temperature

The rate constant, k, depends on temperature according to the Arrhenius equation:

k = Ae^(-Ea/RT)

where A is the pre-exponential factor, Ea is the activation energy, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature. This means that the rate constant, and therefore the rate of the reaction, does indeed depend on temperature.

In summary:
A, C, and D are true statements for a zeroth order reaction, while B is false.

The correct answer is [B].
