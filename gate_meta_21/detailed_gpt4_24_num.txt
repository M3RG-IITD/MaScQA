We are given the flow velocity and the free stream velocity. To find the thickness of the boundary layer, we need to find the distance y at which the flow velocity is 99% of the free stream velocity. In other words, we need to find the distance y at which $V_x$ = 0.99$V_\infty$.

The velocity potential function we are given is:

$V_x = 0.5y - 0.5y^3$

We know that at the edge of the boundary layer, $V_x = 0.99V_\infty$. Let's call this $V_{x,edge}$. 

$V_{x,edge} = 0.5y_{edge} - 0.5y_{edge}^3$

Now we need to solve for $y_{edge}$:

$0.99V_\infty = 0.5y_{edge} - 0.5y_{edge}^3$

We can divide the whole equation by 0.5 to simplify:

$1.98V_\infty = y_{edge} - y_{edge}^3$

We are not given a value for $V_\infty$, so we cannot find an exact numerical answer for $y_{edge}$ or the thickness of the boundary layer. However, we can solve for $y_{edge}$ in terms of $V_\infty$:

$y_{edge}^3 - y_{edge} = 1.98V_\infty$

Although this equation is not solvable analytically, you could use numerical methods to solve for $y_{edge}$ as a specific value, and the thickness of the boundary layer (δ) will just be equal to $y_{edge}$.

For example, using a numerical method like Newton's method or a computer software to solve for the roots, you can find a value for $y_{edge}$. Then, to get the thickness of the boundary layer (δ) in meters, you would round off the value of $y_{edge}$ to 2 decimal places.

[It is not possible to provide an exact answer without the value of $V_\infty$.]
