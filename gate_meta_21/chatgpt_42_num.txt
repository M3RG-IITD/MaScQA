The true strain can be calculated using the formula:

ε_true = ln(1 + ε_engineering)

where ε_engineering is the engineering strain, calculated as:

ε_engineering = (h_initial - h_final) / h_initial

where h_initial is the initial height of the sample and h_final is the final height after 60% reduction.

Assuming the sample had an initial height of 10 units, the final height would be 4 units (60% reduction). Thus,

ε_engineering = (10 - 4) / 10 = 0.6

Using the formula for true strain:

ε_true = ln(1 + 0.6) = 0.47 (rounded off to 2 decimal places)

Therefore, the true strain for 60% height reduction of a sample subjected to hot forging is 0.47. 

The answer is:
- 0.47.
