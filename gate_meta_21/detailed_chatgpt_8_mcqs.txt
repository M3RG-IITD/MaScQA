Creep is a time-dependent plastic deformation that occurs under constant load or stress (usually high temperature) due to the movement of dislocations in the material. Let's analyze each option to see which one is false:

(A) The minimum creep rate is obtained in the primary stage (stage I): This is true. In the primary stage (stage I), the rate of creep is high but it gradually decreases until it reaches a minimum value. This is due to the gradual rearrangement and alignment of dislocations to form new sub-grain boundaries.

(B) Creep resistance decreases with decrease in grain size: This is false. In fact, creep resistance increases with decrease in grain size. This is because smaller grains have a larger surface area per unit volume, which inhibits the movement of dislocations and improves the strength of the material.

(C) Coble creep occurs via grain boundary diffusion: This is true. Coble creep occurs in polycrystalline materials and is caused by the diffusion of atoms along grain boundaries, which results in the elongation of grains in the direction of applied stress.

(D) Nabarro-Herring creep occurs via lattice diffusion: This is true as well. Nabarro-Herring creep occurs via lattice diffusion and is caused by the diffusion of atoms through the lattice of the crystal structure.

Therefore, the false statement is (B) Creep resistance decreases with decrease in grain size.

Correct answer: (B)
