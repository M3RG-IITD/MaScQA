(P) Submerged Entry Nozzle is related to continuous casting. The molten steel is fed from the ladle to the tundish and then flows through a submerged entry nozzle (SEN) into the mold.

(Q) Electric Heating is used in the Ladle Furnace. An electric arc is used to heat the ladle and refine the steel chemistry.

(R) Raceway Zone is used in the Blast Furnace. It is the area in the upper part of the furnace where coke and ore are fed, and combustion takes place.

(S) Oxygen Lancing is used in the LD Convertor, where oxygen is blown through a lance onto the molten pig iron to reduce the carbon content and produce steel.

Therefore, the correct matching is:
(A) P-2, Q-1, R-4, S-3.
