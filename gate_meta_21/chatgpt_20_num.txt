We know that the magnetic moment per atom can be given as:

$\mu = \frac{M}{n}$

where $\mu$ is the magnetic moment per atom, $M$ is the saturation magnetization and $n$ is the number of atoms per unit volume.

We need to first calculate the number of iron atoms per unit volume. For a simple cubic lattice (which is a good approximation for iron), the number of atoms per unit volume can be calculated as:

$n = \frac{1}{V}$

where $V$ is the volume of the unit cell. For a simple cubic lattice, the volume of the unit cell can be calculated as:

$V = a^3$

where $a$ is the lattice parameter.

Substituting the given values, we get:

$n = \frac{1}{(0.287 \times 10^{-9})^3}$

$n = 1.073 \times 10^{29}$ atoms/m$^3$

Now, we can calculate the magnetic moment per atom:

$\mu = \frac{M}{n}$

$\mu = \frac{1700 \times 10^3}{1.073 \times 10^{29}}$

$\mu = 1.584 \times 10^{-23}$ Am$^2$

Rounding off to 1 decimal place, the answer is:
