To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the critical radius (r*) of a nucleus during homogeneous nucleation:

r* = 2 * σ / (ΔGv * (Tm - T))

In this equation:
- σ is the surface energy of the nucleus,
- ΔGv is the volume free energy change during solidification,
- Tm is the melting temperature of the solid,
- T is the temperature of the undercooled liquid.

We are given that the surface energy of a nucleus increases by 20%, so the new surface energy σ' will be:

σ' = 1.20σ

Now, we need to find the new critical radius r*' using this new surface energy:

r*' = 2 * σ' / (ΔGv * (Tm - T)) = 2 * (1.20 * σ) / (ΔGv * (Tm - T))

Now, let's find the ratio r*' / r* to see the percentage increase in critical radius:

r*' / r* = (2 * (1.20 * σ) / (ΔGv * (Tm - T))) / (2 * σ / (ΔGv * (Tm - T)))

Notice that the terms 2, ΔGv, (Tm - T) cancel out:

r*' / r* = 1.20 * σ / σ = 1.20

So the critical radius has increased by 20%. Therefore, the answer is:
