To answer this question, let's look at each statement and determine if it is true or false.

(A) The minimum creep rate is obtained in the primary stage (stage I)
- FALSE: Creep deformation occurs in three stages: primary, secondary, and tertiary. The primary stage (stage I) is characterized by a decreasing creep rate. However, the minimum creep rate is obtained in the secondary stage (stage II), where the creep rate becomes constant.

(B) Creep resistance decreases with a decrease in grain size
- TRUE: Fine-grained materials generally offer better creep resistance compared to coarse-grained materials. As the grain size decreases, there is an increase in the number of grain boundaries, which hinders dislocation movement and slows down the creep deformation rate.

(C) Coble creep occurs via grain boundary diffusion
- TRUE: Coble creep is a type of diffusional creep that occurs in polycrystalline materials at low stress levels and high temperatures. The deformation mechanism in Coble creep involves diffusion of atoms along the grain boundaries.

(D) Nabarro-Herring creep occurs via lattice diffusion
- TRUE: Nabarro-Herring creep, another type of diffusional creep, occurs when atoms diffuse through the crystal lattice of a material at high temperatures and low stress levels. This deformation mechanism is due to the vacancy diffusion in the lattice, accounting for a slow creep rate in materials.

Hence, the correct answer is:
