The binary phase diagram of A-B shows how the phase changes with the change in temperatures and compositions. The conditions required for the given diagram are as follows:

1. At point P, the two phases (solid and liquid) are in equilibrium. Therefore, the Gibbs free energy (ΔG) of the solid and liquid phases at this point is equal. Mathematically:

   ΔG_(solid) = ΔG_(liquid)
   
   Since ΔG = ΔH - TΔS, where ΔH is the enthalpy, T is the temperature, and ΔS is the entropy, we can write:

   ΔH_(solid) - TΔS_(solid) = ΔH_(liquid) - TΔS_(liquid)
   
   Rearranging, we get:

   ΔH_(mix)^(solid) - ΔH_(mix)^(liquid) = T(ΔS_(mix)^(liquid) - ΔS_(mix)^(solid))
   
   Therefore, if ΔH_(mix)^(solid) - ΔH_(mix)^(liquid) = 0, then T(ΔS_(mix)^(liquid) - ΔS_(mix)^(solid)) must also be 0. This means that the entropy of mixing in the liquid and solid phases is equal, which is the condition for getting the binary phase diagram of A-B shown in the figure. 

2. If ΔH_(mix)^(solid) - ΔH_(mix)^(liquid) is not equal to 0, then the entropy of mixing in the solid and liquid phases must be different. This would result in a non-vertical tie line and a non-ideal solution behavior. Therefore, options B, C and D are not correct.

Hence, the answer is (A) ΔH_(mix)^(solid) = 0 and ΔH_(mix)^(liquid) = 0.
