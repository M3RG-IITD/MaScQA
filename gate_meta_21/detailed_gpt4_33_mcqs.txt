We are given a one-dimensional steady-state temperature distribution in two adjacent refractory blocks with thermal conductivities $k_1$ and $k_2$. Unfortunately, there's no image provided, but we can still solve the problem without it by analyzing the given information and using the concepts of thermal conductivity and contact resistance. 

The heat transfer in a one-dimensional steady-state system can be described by Fourier's law: 
$$q = -k \frac{dT}{dx}$$ 

where $q$ is the heat transfer rate (in Watts), $k$ is the thermal conductivity of the material (in W/mK), $dT$ is the temperature difference across the material (in K), and $dx$ is the distance the heat transfer occurs over (in meters). We are given that the cross-sectional area of the materials is 1 mÂ².

To analyze the thermal contact resistance, we can apply the concept of a thermal resistance in series. The total thermal resistance, $R_{total}$, is the sum of the individual resistances, so we have:

$$R_{total} = R_1 + R_2 + R_{interface}=\frac{dx_1}{k_1 A}+\frac{dx_2}{k_2 A}+R_{interface} $$

We can rearrange the equation to account for the fact that $A=1\:m^2$:

$$R_{total} = \frac{dx_1}{k_1} + \frac{dx_2}{k_2} + R_{interface} $$

Now let's analyze the given temperature information in the problem. We are given that one side of the refractory blocks is at temperature $T_1$, and the other side (not given) is $T_2$. We can relate the heat transfer to the temperature difference across the system by:

$$q = \frac{T_2 - T_1}{R_{total}}$$

We need to solve the problem using the given options, so we'll analyze each choice provided and see which one gives us a solution that meets the conditions. Let's start with option (A).

(A) $T_1 = 200\:K$, $R_{interface} = 0.5\:K\:W^{-1}$

We don't have enough information to determine the heat transfer rate $q$ directly, so we can't determine if this option is correct yet. Options (B), (C), and (D) are similar in that they also provide values for $T_1$ and $R_{interface}$ but not enough information to determine the heat transfer rate $q$.

To solve this problem, we would need to have additional information that relates the temperature $T_2$, the heat transfer rate $q$, or the thermal conductivities $k_1$ and $k_2$.

As no further information has been provided, it is not possible to identify the correct answer from the given options. Please provide the required additional information to solve this problem.
