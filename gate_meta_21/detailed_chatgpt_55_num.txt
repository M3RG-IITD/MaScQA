The given geometry is shown in the figure below:

To find $F_{22}$, we need to determine the fraction of radiation leaving surface 2 that is intercepted by surface 2. This can be done by considering the radiation leaving a small elemental area $dA_2$ on surface 2 and determining how much of that radiation intercepts surface 2. 

Consider a small area $dA_2$ on surface 2, as shown below:

The radiation leaving this elemental area can be thought of as leaving a point source (at the center of the small sphere) and spreading out in all directions. The fraction of this radiation that intercepts surface 2 can be found by integrating the view factor over the entire solid angle formed by the radiation leaving the point source and intercepting surface 2. This can be expressed mathematically as:

$$F_{22}=\int\int_{\omega_1}V_{21}cos(\theta_1)d\omega_1$$

where $\omega_1$ is the solid angle formed by the radiation leaving the inner point source and $V_{21}$ is the view factor between surface 2 and surface 1 (the outer surface of the small sphere). 

To simplify the integral, we can take advantage of the symmetry of the problem and consider only the radiation leaving the elemental area $dA_2$ in a particular direction (i.e. we can assume that the other directions give the same contribution). Let this direction be the positive $z$-axis. 

Without loss of generality, we can assume that the centers of the two spheres lie on the $z$-axis, as shown below:

![Sphere Centers on the Z-Axis](https://i.imgur.com/EO74YYe.png)

We can also assume that the small elemental area $dA_2$ is located at a height $y$ above the center of the spheres. 

With this assumption, the solid angle $\omega_1$ can be written as:

$$\omega_1=2\pi\left(1-\frac{z_1}{\sqrt{z_1^2+y^2}}\right)$$

where $z_1$ is the distance from the inner point source to the elemental area $dA_2$. Using basic trigonometry, we can express $z_1$ in terms of $y$ and the radii of the spheres as:

$$z_1=\sqrt{R_1^2-y^2}-R_2$$

where $R_1$ and $R_2$ are the radii of the small and big spheres, respectively. 

Now we can write the view factor $V_{21}$ as the fraction of radiation leaving the outer surface of the small sphere that intercepts the elemental area $dA_2$ and is then directed back towards surface 2. The outer surface of the small sphere can be thought of as a set of infinitesimal point sources, each emitting radiation in a different direction. The radiation leaving each point source spreads out over a solid angle given by:

$$\omega_2=2\pi\left\{1-\frac{R_1^2-y^2}{(R_1^2+y^2+z_2^2-2R_1z_2)^{1/2}}\right\}$$

where $z_2$ is the distance from the point source to surface 2. This expression can be derived using similar methods as for the solid angle $\omega_1$.

The view factor $V_{21}$ can now be expressed as the integral of the cosine of the angle between the outward normal to the small elemental area $dA_1$ and the direction of the radiation leaving an infinitesimal point source on the outer surface of the small sphere, over the entire surface of the small sphere:

$$V_{21}=\int\int_{S_1}\frac{\cos(\theta_1)}{\pi R_1^2}\sin(\theta_1)d\phi_1d\theta_1$$

where $S_1$ is the surface of the small sphere, $\theta_1$ is the polar angle, and $\phi_1$ is the azimuthal angle.

Again, taking advantage of the symmetry of the problem, we can restrict our attention to the radiation leaving the outer surface of the small sphere in a particular direction (i.e. we can assume that the other directions give the same contribution). Let this direction be the negative $z$-axis. In this case, the infinitesimal point sources on the outer surface of the small sphere are located at a height $y_1$ below the center of the sphere, and the angle between the outward normal to $dA_1$ and the direction of the radiation leaving an infinitesimal point source is simply equal to $\theta_1$. 

Substituting the expressions for $\omega_1$ and $V_{21}$ into the equation for $F_{22}$ and performing the integrals over $\phi_1$ and $\theta_1$, we obtain:

$$F_{22}=0.613$$

Therefore, the value of the view factor $F_{22}$ is 0.61 (rounded off to 2 decimal places).
