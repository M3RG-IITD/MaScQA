To find the enthalpy of vacancy formation, we can use the Arrhenius equation relationship between the vacancy concentration, temperature, and enthalpy. The equation is given by:

$$\frac{N_v}{N} = e^\frac{-ΔH_v}{RT}$$

Where $N_v$ is the number of vacancies, $N$ is the total number of atom sites, $ΔH_v$ is the enthalpy of vacancy formation, $R$ is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol K), and $T$ is the temperature.

Since the vacancy concentration doubles, we have:

$$\frac{N_{v2}}{N_{v1}} = 2$$

Given that the vacancy concentration $= e^\frac{-ΔH_v}{RT}$, this gives:

$$\frac{e^\frac{-ΔH_v}{R T_2}}{e^\frac{-ΔH_v}{R T_1}} = 2$$

Now we can simplify the equation by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

$$\frac{-ΔH_v}{R T_2} - \frac{-ΔH_v}{R T_1} = \ln 2$$

Then, solve for the enthalpy of vacancy formation, $ΔH_v$:

$$ΔH_v = \frac{R (\ln 2)}{\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}}$$

Given $T_1 = 27 °C = 300K$ and $T_2 = 127°C = 400K$, and $R = 8.314 J/mol K$, we can plug in the values:

$$ΔH_v = \frac{8.314(\ln 2)}{\frac{1}{300} - \frac{1}{400}}$$

Calculating the result:

$$ΔH_v = 41588.097 J/mol$$

Converting to KJ/mol:

$$ΔH_v = 41.59 KJ/mol$$

Rounded to 2 decimal places, the enthalpy of vacancy formation is 41.59 KJ/mol.

The answer is [41.59].
