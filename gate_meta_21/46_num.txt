Given: Shear modulus, G = 28 GPa, Poisson's ratio v= 0.3, Burgers vector b = 0.29nm, Distance between the two dislocations = 0.5nm. For the edge, the shear stress component is given by: $τ_(xy)$ = [Gb/(2π(1-v))]*[x($x^2$ - $y^2$)/$($x^2$ + $y^2$)^2$]. Two dislocation lines paralled to z-axis lying in the x-z plane are shown in the figure. The glide force (in Newton) exerted by the edge dislocation on the screw dislocation is?(round off to nearest integer)
