We can use the Nernst equation to relate the standard cell potential and the cell potential at non-standard conditions:

$E = E° - \frac{RT}{nF}ln(Q)$

where:

- E is the cell potential at non-standard conditions
- E° is the standard cell potential
- R is the gas constant
- T is the temperature in Kelvin
- n is the number of electrons transferred in the redox reaction
- F is Faraday's constant
- Q is the reaction quotient

At standard conditions, the reaction quotient is equal to 1:

$E° = E° - \frac{RT}{nF}ln(1)$

Simplifying:

$E° = E°$

So we can use the standard cell potential to calculate the standard reduction potential of Ni2+/Ni:

$E°_(Ni^(+2)/Ni) = -0.25 V$

To calculate the standard molar entropy of Ni2+, we can use the relation:

$\Delta G° = -RTln(K)$

where $\Delta G°$ is the standard Gibbs free energy change, and K is the equilibrium constant. At standard conditions, $\Delta G°$ is equal to -nF*E°, and K is equal to the equilibrium constant of the redox reaction:

$Ni^{+2} + 2e^{-} -> Ni$

$K = \frac{[Ni]}{[Ni^{+2}][e^{-}]^2}$

At equilibrium, the cell potential is zero, so the standard cell potential can be related to K:

$E° = \frac{RT}{nF}ln(K)$

Combining the equations, we get:

$-nF*E° = -RTln(K)$

Simplifying:

$ln(K) = \frac{nF}{RT}E°$

Substituting the values:

$ln(K) = \frac{2*96500}{8.314*298}*(-0.25)$

Simplifying:

$ln(K) = -10.45$

Taking the exponential on both sides:

$K = 3.3*10^{-5}$

At non-standard conditions, the reaction quotient Q is equal to the concentrations of the products raised to their stoichiometric coefficients, divided by the concentrations of the reactants raised to their stoichiometric coefficients. In this case, the concentrations of the electrons do not change, so we can ignore them:

$Q = \frac{[Ni]}{[Ni^{+2}]}$

The Nernst equation can be rearranged to solve for $ln(Q)$:

$ln(Q) = \frac{nF}{RT}E - E°$

Substituting the values:

$ln(Q) = \frac{2*96500}{8.314*298}*\mu - (-0.25)$

Simplifying:

$ln(Q) = 0.0081*\mu + 0.61$

At equilibrium, the cell potential is zero, so we can set E to zero and solve for Q:

$ln(Q) = 0.61$

Taking the exponential on both sides:

$Q = 1.83$

Since $Q = \frac{[Ni]}{[Ni^{+2}]}$, we can assume that the concentration of Ni2+ is much greater than the concentration of Ni, so we can approximate:

$Q \approx \frac{[Ni]}{[Ni^{+2}]}$

Solving for [Ni]:

$[Ni] \approx Q*[Ni^{+2}]$

Substituting the values:

$[Ni] \approx 1.83*[Ni^{+2}]$

To calculate the molar entropy of Ni2+, we can use the relation:

$\mu° = \mu°_{ref} + RTln(\frac{P}{P_{ref}})$

where $\mu°_{ref}$ is the standard molar entropy, P is the pressure, and P° is the standard pressure. Since the entropy of a solid is zero, we can assume that the nickel is present as a solid. Therefore, the partial pressure of Ni is zero, and we can simplify the equation:

$\mu°_{Ni^{+2}} = \mu°_{Ni^{+2}} + RTln(\frac{[Ni]}{P_{ref}})$

Rearranging:

$\mu°_{Ni^{+2}} = RTln(\frac{[Ni]}{P_{ref}})$

Substituting the values:

$\mu°_{Ni^{+2}} = 8.314*298*ln(\frac{1.83*[Ni^{+2}]}{1})$

Simplifying:

$\mu°_{Ni^{+2}} = 56951.73 Jmol^{-1}$

Rounding off to the nearest integer, we get:

$\mu°_{Ni^{+2}} = 56952 Jmol^{-1}$

Therefore, the correct answer is:

- 56952 J/mol
