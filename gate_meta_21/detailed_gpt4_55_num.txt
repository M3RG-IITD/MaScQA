We are given a solid sphere (0.5m radius) enclosed within a large hollow sphere (1m radius), and we are to find the view factor $F_{22}$, which is the fraction of radiation leaving the inner surface of the bigger sphere (surface 2) that is intercepted by the same surface (surface 2).

We can solve this problem using the Enclosure Formula. The Enclosure Formula states that for any two enclosure surfaces i and j, their view factors satisfy:

$A_i F_{ij} + A_j F_{ji} = A_i A_j$

where $A_i$ and $A_j$ represent the areas of surfaces i and j.

In this particular case, the areas of the outer surface of the small sphere (surface 1) and inner surface of the larger sphere (surface 2) are:

$A_1 = 4\pi R_1^2 = 4\pi(0.5)^2 = 4\pi(0.25) = \pi$

$A_2 = 4\pi R_2^2 = 4\pi(1)^2 = 4\pi$

Now let's rewrite the enclosure relation for our surfaces:

$\pi F_{12} + 4\pi F_{21} = \pi \cdot 4\pi$

As the small sphere and large sphere enclose a space between them, the view factors for surface-1 and surface-2 should cover 100% of the radiation exchange, therefore:

$F_{12} + F_{21} = 1$

Substituting $F_{21} = 1 - F_{12}$ into the enclosure formula, we have:

$\pi F_{12} + 4\pi (1 - F_{12}) = \pi \cdot 4\pi$

Now let's solve for $F_{12}$:

$\pi F_{12} + 4\pi - 4\pi F_{12} = \pi \cdot 4\pi$

Combine terms:

$3\pi F_{12} = 4\pi - \pi \cdot 4\pi$

Simplify:

$F_{12} = \frac{4 - 4\pi}{3} \approx 0.294$

Now that we have $F_{12}$, we can find $F_{21}$ using $F_{12} + F_{21} = 1$:

$F_{21} = 1 - F_{12} \approx 1 - 0.294 \approx 0.706$

Finally, we can find $F_{22}$ using the Reciprocity Formula, which states that for any two surfaces i and j, their view factors satisfy:

$A_i F_{ij} = A_j F_{ji}$

In this case, we are looking for $F_{22}$, so we can use the fact that $A_1 F_{12} = A_2 F_{21}$, and rearrange to obtain:

$F_{22} = 1 - \frac{A_1}{A_2} F_{12}$

$F_{22} = 1 - \frac{\pi}{4\pi} \cdot 0.294$

$F_{22} = 1 - \frac{0.294}{4} \approx 1 - 0.0735$

$F_{22} \approx 0.9265$

Therefore, the view factor $F_{22}$, rounded to two decimal places, is approximately 0.93.

Hence, the correct answer inside a list is [0.93].
