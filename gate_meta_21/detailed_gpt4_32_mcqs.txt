To determine which slip system will be activated, we need to calculate the resolved shear stress for each slip system and compare it to the critical resolved shear stress (CRSS). The slip system with the highest resolved shear stress greater than or equal to the CRSS will be activated.

The resolved shear stress (τ) is given by the formula:

τ = σ.applied * cos (λ) * cos (ϕ)

where σ.applied is the applied tensile stress (100 MPa), λ is the angle between the load direction [1 1 2] and the slip direction, and ϕ is the angle between the load direction [1 1 2] and the slip plane normal.

Let's calculate the angles λ and ϕ, and the resolved shear stress τ for each slip system:

(A) Slip direction: [-1 0 1]; Slip plane normal: [1 1 1]

λ = angle between [1 1 2] and [-1 0 1] = 90°
ϕ = angle between [1 1 2] and [1 1 1] = 19.47°
τ = 100 * cos(90) * cos(19.47) = 0

(B) Slip direction: [-1 1 0]; Slip plane normal: [1 1 1]

λ = angle between [1 1 2] and [-1 1 0] = 54.74°
ϕ = angle between [1 1 2] and [1 1 1] = 19.47°
τ = 100 * cos(54.74) * cos(19.47) = 43.70 MPa

(C) Slip direction: [1 0 1]; Slip plane normal: [1 1 -1]

λ = angle between [1 1 2] and [1 0 1] = 35.26°
ϕ = angle between [1 1 2] and [1 1 -1] = 56.31°
τ = 100 * cos(35.26) * cos(56.31) = 27.46 MPa

(D) Slip direction: [0 1 1]; Slip plane normal: [1 1 -1]

λ = angle between [1 1 2] and [0 1 1] = 90°
ϕ = angle between [1 1 2] and [1 1 -1] = 56.31°
τ = 100 * cos(90) * cos(56.31) = 0

Now, compare the calculated resolved shear stresses with the CRSS (25 MPa):

(A) τ = 0 < 25 MPa
(B) τ = 43.70 > 25 MPa
(C) τ = 27.46 > 25 MPa
(D) τ = 0 < 25 MPa

Slip systems (B) and (C) have resolved shear stresses greater than the CRSS. Therefore, these slip systems will be activated. However, slip system (B) has a higher resolved shear stress (43.70 MPa) than slip system (C) (27.46 MPa), so slip system (B) is more likely to be activated first.

The correct answer is (B) [-1 1 0](1 1 1).

Answer: [(B)].
