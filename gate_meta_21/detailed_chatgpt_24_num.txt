To find the boundary layer thickness, we first need to find the momentum thickness $\theta(x)$. 

The momentum thickness $\theta(x)$ is given by:

$$
\theta(x)=\int_0^\infty \left(1-\frac{u(x,y)}{V_\infty}\right) dy
$$

where $u(x,y)$ is the velocity profile at a distance x along the plate. 

From the given velocity profile:

$$
u(x,y)=V_x=0.5y-0.5y^3
$$

We know that at the boundary layer edge, $u(x,\delta(x))=0.99V_\infty$, so we can solve for $\delta(x)$:

$$
0.99V_\infty=0.5\delta(x)-0.5\delta(x)^3
$$

Solving for $\delta(x)$, we get:

$$
\delta(x)=\sqrt{\frac{2\times(1-0.99)}{0.5}} \approx \boxed{0.07 \ m}
$$
