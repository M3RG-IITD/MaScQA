For uniaxial tensile stress-strain behaviour of polycrystalline aluminium, which one of the following statements is FALSE?
(A) True stress is always higher than the engineerig stress. (B) At the ultimate stress point on the true stress-strain curve, dσ/dε = 0 (C) Resilience is the area under the elastic region of the engineering stress-strain curve. (D) Maximum true stress does not correspond to the maximum load.
