First of all, we need to find the liquidus and solidus temperatures for the given composition of 5 wt.% B. From the given phase diagram, we can observe that the eutectic composition occurs at 20 wt.% B and a eutectic temperature of about 600 K. Therefore, for an alloy with 5 wt.% B, the liquidus temperature can be estimated to be 800 K and the solidus temperature can be estimated to be 700 K.

Next, we can use the relation between the critical temperature gradient (G) and the velocity of solidification front (v) as follows:

G = v * D / L

Where D is the diffusivity of B in the liquid and L is the latent heat of fusion of the alloy. The value of L can be estimated from the phase diagram as the difference between the liquidus and solidus temperatures, i.e., L = 800 K - 700 K = 100 K.

Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:

G = (4 * 10^(-3) m/s) * (10^(-9) m^2/s) / (100000 J/m^3)

G = 4 * 10^(-13) K/mm

Rounding off to the nearest integer, we get the critical temperature gradient required to maintain the planar solidification front as 0 K/mm.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

- 0 K/mm
