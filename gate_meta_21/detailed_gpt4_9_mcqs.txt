To determine which element is a ferrite stabilizer when alloyed with iron, we will first define what ferrite stabilizers are and then discuss each given element's tendency to stabilize the ferrite phase in iron. 

Ferrite (α-Fe) is a solid solution of carbon or other alloying elements in α-iron at low temperatures. Ferrite has a body-centered cubic (BCC) crystal structure. Ferrite stabilizers are elements that promote the formation and stability of the ferrite phase in iron or steel, primarily by enlarging the ferrite phase field in the phase diagram.

Now, let's analyze each given element:

A) Nickel (Ni)
Nickel is a face-centered cubic (FCC) element and when added to iron, it tends to stabilize the austenite phase, which is also FCC, rather than the ferrite phase. Therefore, Nickel is not a ferrite stabilizer.

B) Manganese (Mn)
Manganese tends to expand the ferrite phase field by lowering the temperature at which austenite starts to transform into ferrite in the iron-carbon phase diagram. This results in enhanced stability of the ferrite phase. Therefore, Manganese is a ferrite stabilizer.

C) Carbon (C)
Carbon is an austenite stabilizer since it prefers the FCC structure of austenite over the BCC structure of ferrite. Additionally, it significantly expands the field of austenite in the iron-carbon phase diagram. Therefore, Carbon is not a ferrite stabilizer.

D) Silicon (Si)
Silicon stabilizes ferrite by strengthening the BCC crystal structure and expands the ferrite phase field in the phase diagram. This leads to efficient ferrite stabilization when it is alloyed with iron. Therefore, Silicon is a ferrite stabilizer.

As we have analyzed each element's tendency to stabilize ferrite when alloyed with iron, we can conclude the correct answer:

[B, D].
