We can determine the Gibbs free energy (ΔG°) for the equilibrium reaction by combining the given ΔG° values for the two individual reactions:

ΔG°(equilibrium) = ΔG°(1st reaction) + ΔG°(2nd reaction)
ΔG°(equilibrium) = -100 kJ + 292 kJ
ΔG°(equilibrium) = 192 kJ

Now, we can use the relationship between ΔG° and the equilibrium constant Kp for the reaction:

ΔG° = -RTlnKp
192 kJ = -8.314 J/mol·K * 973 K * lnKp
192000 J = -8086.282 * lnKp
lnKp = -23.738

Now, let's write the equilibrium constant Kp in terms of partial pressures of the gases:

Kp = (P_O2 / P_SO2)

We can use the relationship between lnKp and the partial pressures:

ln(P_O2 / P_SO2) = -23.738

Therefore, the value of ln(P_O2 / P_SO2) at 973K is approximately [-23.74].
