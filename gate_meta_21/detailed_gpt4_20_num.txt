To find the magnetic moment per iron atom in the crystal, we first need to find the total number of iron atoms in a unit cell, which can be found by knowing the lattice parameter and crystal structure.

Iron crystallizes in a body-centered cubic (BCC) crystal structure. In a body-centered cubic lattice, there are atoms at the eight corners and one at the center of the unit cell. Each corner atom is shared by 8 unit cells, whereas the central atom is exclusive to the unit cell. So, the total number of atoms in a unit cell is given by:

Number of atoms in unit cell = (8 atoms at corners × 1/8) + 1 central atom = 1 + 1 = 2 atoms

Now, we need to find the volume of the unit cell to calculate the density of iron atoms in the crystal.

The lattice parameter (edge length of the cube unit cell) is given as 0.287 nm, which is equivalent to 0.287 × 10^(-9) m. The volume of the unit cell (V) is given by:

V = a^3 = (0.287 * 10^-9)³ = 2.365 × 10^(-29) m³

In one unit cell, there are two iron atoms. Therefore, the number of iron atoms in 1 m^(-3) volume of the crystal can be calculated by dividing the total number of atoms in a unit cell by the volume of the unit cell:

Number of atoms per m³ = 2 atoms / (2.365 × 10^(-29) m³) = 8.46 × 10^(28) atoms/m³

Since the saturation magnetization is given as 1700 kAm^(-1), we can find the total magnetic moment (M) for the total number of iron atoms within a 1 m³ volume. The relation between magnetization and magnetic moment is:

M = Saturation Magnetization × Volume
M = 1700 × 10^(3) Am^(-1) × 1 m³ = 1.7 × 10^(6) Am²

Now, we have the total magnetic moment for 8.46 × 10^(28) iron atoms; we can now find the magnetic moment per iron atom (m):

m = M / Number of atoms
m = (1.7 × 10^(6) Am²) / (8.46 × 10^(28) atoms/m³)

m = 2.009 × 10^(-23) Am² per iron atom

After rounding off to one decimal place, the magnetic moment per iron atom is 2.0 × 10^(-23) Am².

So the final answer is [2.0].
