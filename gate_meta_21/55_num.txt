Given: View factor ($F_(ij)$) is the fraction of the radiation leaving surface i that is intercepted by surface j. A solid sphere (0.5m radius) is enclosed within a large hollow sphere(1 m radius), as shown in figure. The radiation exchange takes places between the outer surface (surface 1) of the small sphere and the inner surface (surface 2) of the bigger sphere. The value of the view factor, $F_(22)$ is?(round off to 2 decimal places)
