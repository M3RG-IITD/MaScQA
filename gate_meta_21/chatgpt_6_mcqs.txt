The correct answer is (B) If ΔH_mix = 0, then a_B > X_B.

Explanation: When A and B have the same crystal structure, the enthalpy of mixing (ΔH_mix) is usually close to zero for dilute solutions. In this case, the activity coefficient (γ) of both A and B are close to 1. Therefore, the mole fraction of B in the solution (X_B) will be almost equal to the activity of B (a_B). So, if ΔH_mix = 0, then a_B is equal or very close to X_B, but it cannot be less than X_B as stated in option (A) or (C). On the other hand, it is expected that a_B will be slightly higher than X_B because of the short-range order in the solution. This means that B atoms tend to cluster together due to their interactions, resulting in a slight excess in the activity of B and a slightly higher mole fraction of B than expected from random mixing. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer. Finally, option (D) is incorrect because it is expected that a_B > X_B whenever ΔH_mix < 0 for any type of solution.
