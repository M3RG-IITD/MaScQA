First, we need to determine the molecular formula for polyethylene. The molecular formula for polyethylene is (C₂H₄)n, where n is the degree of polymerization. 

In this case, n = 30000. So, the molecular formula for this polyethylene is (C₂H₄)₃₀₀₀₀. 

Next, calculate the molar mass of the monomer (ethylene) C₂H₄: 
Molar mass of C₂H₄ = (2 x Molar mass of C) + (4 x Molar mass of H)
Molar mass of C₂H₄ = (2 x 12) + (4 x 1)
Molar mass of C₂H₄ = 24 + 4
Molar mass of C₂H₄ = 28 g/mol

Now, calculate the average molecular weight of the polyethylene:
Average molecular weight = (Degree of polymerization) x (Molar mass of the monomer)
Average molecular weight = 30000 x 28
Average molecular weight = 840000 g/mol

Rounding to the nearest integer, the average molecular weight of the polyethylene is [840000].
