Firstly, we need to find the heat absorbed and the heat rejected by the engine in one complete cycle. This can be done using the area enclosed by the T-S plot.
Using the formula for the efficiency of a Carnot cycle, we get:
efficiency = $\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1}$
efficiency = $\frac{200-600}{200}$ = -2 (Note that this value is negative because the temperature scale is in absolute units and we are only interested in the magnitude of the efficiency.)
However, the question asks for the answer in percent, so we need to multiply the value by 100 and take the absolute value:
efficiency = |-2 * 100| = 200%

Therefore, the efficiency of the engine is 200%. 

Answer: [200%]
