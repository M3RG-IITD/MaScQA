To find the number of degrees of freedom for the reacting system, we can use the formula:

Degrees of freedom (F) = Number of components (C) - Number of independent chemical reactions (R) + Number of phases (P)

In this reaction, we have 4 components (M(s), $CO_2$(g), MO(s), and CO(g)).

There is 1 independent chemical reaction: M(s) + $CO_2$(g) = MO(s) + CO(g).

There are 2 phases in the reacting system:
1. Solid phase (for M(s) and MO(s))
2. Gas phase (for $CO_2$(g) and CO(g))

Now, we can calculate the degrees of freedom using the formula:

F = C - R + P
F = 4 - 1 + 2
F = 3 + 2
F = 5

However, we need to consider that equilibrium constant (K) places an additional constraint on the system. So, we must subtract one while calculating the degrees of freedom:

F = 5 - 1
F = 4
