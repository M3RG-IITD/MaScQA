We can use the formula:

$Cross-sectional\ area = \frac{Power\ output}{Heat\ input\ per\ unit\ length}$

First, let's find the heat input per unit length:

$Heat\ input\ per\ unit\ length = \frac{Energy\ required\ per\ unit\ volume}{Melting\ factor \times Heat\ transfer\ factor}$

We are not given the dimensions of the weld, but we know that the weld is continuous, so the cross-sectional area will depend on the travel speed of the weld. The faster the travel speed, the narrower the cross-sectional area.

Let's assume that the cross-sectional shape of the weld is rectangular, with a width of 2 mm (half of the total cross-sectional width) and a height of h mm. Then the cross-sectional area is:

$Cross-sectional\ area = 2h$

The heat input per unit length is:

$Heat\ input\ per\ unit\ length = \frac{6\ J\ mm^{-3}}{0.5 \times 0.6} = 20\ J\ mm^{-1}$

Now we can use the formula to find the cross-sectional area:

$Cross-sectional\ area = \frac{3000\ W}{20\ J\ mm^{-1} \times 6\ mm\ s^{-1}} = 25\ mm^2$

Rounding off to the nearest integer, the answer is:

- 25

Therefore, the cross-sectional area of the weld is 25 $mm^2$.
