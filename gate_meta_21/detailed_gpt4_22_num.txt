To find the fraction of proeutectoid ferrite in the 0.6 wt.% C steel sample, we'll use the Lever Rule. The Lever Rule is based on the conservation of mass and is a graphical method for estimating the fractions of different phases in a material.

Here's how we'll apply the Lever Rule in this case:

1. Identify the phases involved: In this case, we have austenite (γ, which transforms into the eutectoid mixture of ferrite (α) and cementite (Fe3C)).

2. Identify the critical composition limits: For 0.6 wt.% C steel in the eutectoid region, the critical limits are maximum solubility of carbon in α-Fe (0.025 wt.% C) and eutectoid composition (0.8 wt.% C).

3. Set up the lever rule: The fraction of proeutectoid ferrite (α) in the microstructure is given by:

   fraction (α) = (eutectoid composition - alloy composition) / (eutectoid composition - maximum solubility of carbon in α-Fe)
   
   fraction (α) = (0.8 - 0.6) / (0.8 - 0.025)

4. Calculate the fraction of proeutectoid ferrite:

   fraction (α) = (0.2) / (0.775)
   
5. Round off to two decimal places:

   fraction (α) ≈ 0.26

Therefore, the fraction of proeutectoid ferrite in the 0.6 wt.% C steel sample when cooled from 900°C to room temperature is approximately 0.26, or 26%.

Answer: [0.26]
