First, we need to find the shear stress exerted by the fluid on the tube wall. The shear stress (τ) is related to the velocity gradient, which is the derivative of the velocity with respect to the radial distance r.

So, we have to find dv_z/dr:

v_z = [ΔP/L]*({$R^2$ - $r^2$}/4µ)

Now, we differentiate v_z with respect to r:

dv_z/dr = -[ΔP/L]*($r/2µ)

The shear stress at the wall can be found by evaluating the velocity gradient at r = R:

τ_wall = µ(dv_z/dr)_wall = -µ[ΔP/L]*($R/2µ)

Simplifying, we have:

τ_wall = -ΔPR/(2L)

Since the negative sign indicates the direction of the shear stress, the magnitude of shear stress exerted by the fluid on the tube wall is:

τ_wall = ΔPR/(2L)

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) ΔPR/(2L).

Answer: [(A) ΔPR/(2L)]
