The solidification time in a casting is directly proportional to the square of its characteristic length. In this case, the characteristic length of the spherical casting is its radius (r = 6 cm) and that of the cubical casting is its edge length (l = 12 cm).

Let's call the solidification time for the cubical casting "t" (in minutes).

Using the proportionality, we can write:

(t/60) = (l^2/r^2)

Substituting the values, we get:

(t/60) = (12^2/6^2)

(t/60) = 4

t = 4 x 60 = 240 minutes

Rounding off to the nearest integer, the time required to solidify in the cubical casting is 240 minutes.

Therefore, the answer is:
- 240 minutes
