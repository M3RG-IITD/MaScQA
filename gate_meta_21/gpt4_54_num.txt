We are given that weight gain is proportional to the square root of time. So, we can write the proportionality as:

Weight gain = k * (square root of time)

For the first case, weight gain = 2mg (after 400s). So, we can write:

2 = k * (square root of 400)

Now we solve for k:

k = 2 / (square root of 400)
k = 2 / 20
k = 0.1

Now we need to find the weight gain after 1600s. So, we plug in the time and k value:

Weight gain = 0.1 * (square root of 1600)

Weight gain = 0.1 * 40

Weight gain = 4 mg/cm^2

Since we need to round it to the nearest integer, the weight gain after a duration of 1600s is 4 mg/cm^2.

The correct answer is [4].
