In basic oxygen steel making process, oxygen is blown through the molten pig iron at high speed which oxidizes the impurities and removes them as slag. During this process, the following reactions take place:

1. Si + 2O2 → SiO2
2. C + O2 → CO2
3. Mn + 2O2 → MnO2
4. P + 5O2 → P4O10

From the above equations, it can be seen that carbon oxidizes first as it only requires one oxygen atom to form carbon dioxide, while the other elements require two or more oxygen atoms to be completely oxidized. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Carbon. 

Answer: 
- (B) Carbon
