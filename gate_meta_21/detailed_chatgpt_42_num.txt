To determine the true strain for 60% height reduction of a sample subjected to hot forging, we can use the true strain equation:

ε_true = ln (l_i/l_f)

where ε_true is the true strain, l_i is the initial length of the sample, and l_f is the final length of the sample.

Assuming that the material is incompressible, we can use the relationship between height reduction and strain:

height reduction = (l_i - l_f)/l_i = 1 - l_f/l_i

Rearranging,

l_f/l_i = 1 - height reduction

l_f/l_i = 1 - 60/100

l_f/l_i = 0.4

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln (l_f/l_i) = ln 0.4

Using a calculator,

ln (l_f/l_i) = -0.916

Therefore, the true strain for 60% height reduction of the sample is -0.916 (rounded to 2 decimal places).

Answer:
-0.92
