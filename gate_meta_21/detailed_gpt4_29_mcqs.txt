To solve this problem, we need to understand what degrees of freedom (DoF) mean in the context of a reacting system. In chemistry, degrees of freedom refer to the number of independent variables or parameters that can be manipulated without affecting the others in the system.

The given reaction can be represented as follows:

M(s) + CO2(g) â†” MO(s) + CO(g)

We have 4 chemical species present in the reaction: M(s), CO2(g), MO(s), and CO(g).

According to the Gibbs phase rule, the degrees of freedom for a reacting system can be calculated using the formula:

DoF = C - P + 2

Where, 
C = number of components in the system
P = number of phases in the system

In this case, we have:

1. Components: The given reaction has 4 distinct chemical species, so C = 4.

2. Phases: There are two phases present in the system: solid (s) and gas (g). Therefore, P = 2.

Now, we can apply the formula to calculate the degrees of freedom:

DoF = C - P + 2
DoF = 4 - 2 + 2
DoF = 2 + 2
DoF = 4

However, we must account for the constraint provided by the balanced chemical equation. Since the equation is balanced, only one independent reaction can occur. Therefore, we need to subtract 1 from our calculated value of DoF:

Adjusted DoF = 4 - 1
Adjusted DoF = 3

The correct answer is (D) 3.
