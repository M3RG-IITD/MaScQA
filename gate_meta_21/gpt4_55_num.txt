First, we need to find the view factor $F_{12}$ between the outer surface of the small sphere (surface 1) and the inner surface of the larger sphere (surface 2). We can apply the reciprocity theorem, which states:

$$A_1F_{12} = A_2F_{21}$$

Where $A_1$ and $A_2$ represent the areas of surfaces 1 and 2, respectively. Since the question is looking for the view factor $F_{22}$, we know that:

$$F_{12} + F_{22} = 1$$

Now we can calculate the area of both surfaces. The area of a sphere is given by the formula:

$$A = 4\pi r^2$$

For surface 1, the radius $r_1 = 0.5$ m, so:

$$A_1 = 4\pi (0.5)^2 = \pi$$

For surface 2, the radius $r_2 = 1$ m, so:

$$A_2 = 4\pi (1)^2 = 4\pi$$

Now we can substitute the areas into the reciprocity theorem equation:

$$\pi F_{12} = 4\pi F_{21}$$

Canceling the $\pi$ from both sides and rearranging to solve for $F_{21}$:

$$F_{21} = \frac{F_{12}}{4}$$

Finally, substitute this result into the equation relating $F_{12}$ and $F_{22}$:

$$F_{12} + F_{22} = 1 \Rightarrow F_{22} = 1 - F_{12}$$

Substituting for $F_{12}$:

$$F_{22} = 1 - 4F_{21}$$

And substituting for $F_{21}$ in terms of $F_{12}$:

$$F_{22} = 1 - 4 \left( \frac{F_{12}}{4} \right)$$

$$F_{22} = 1 - F_{12}$$

For concentric spheres, the view factor $F_{12} = 1$. Therefore, $F_{22} = 1 - F_{12} = 1 - 1 = 0$.

So the view factor $F_{22}$ is:

$$F_{22} = 0$$
