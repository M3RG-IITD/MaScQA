The Nernst equation for an electrode reaction is given as follows.

$E=E^0-\frac{RT}{nF}lnQ_c$

$E^0$ represents the standard electrode potential, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, F is the Faraday constant, $Q_c$ is the concentration quotient, and n is the number of electrons exchanged in the reaction. 

The corrosion of iron in acidic environment involves the following reaction:

$Fe → Fe^{2+} + 2e^{-}$

The exchange current density can be used to determine the corrosion current density using the Tafel equation:

$i=i_{corr}[exp(\frac{αnF}{RT}(E-E_{corr}))]$

$i_{corr}$ is the exchange current density, α is the Tafel slope, E is the potential, and $E_{corr}$ is the corrosion potential. 

At the corrosion potential, $i = i_{corr}$. Substituting this into the Tafel equation, we get:

$E_{corr} = E + \frac{RT}{αnF}ln\frac{i_{corr}}{i}$

Given βc = 0.1 V per decade of current density, we can find α using the following relation:

$α = \frac{2.303RT}{β_cnF}$

Substituting the given values, we get:

$α = \frac{2.303\times8.314\times298}{0.1\times1\times96500}$ 

$α = 0.0609$

Substituting the values into the Tafel equation, we get:

$E_{corr} = E + \frac{RT}{αnF}ln\frac{i_{corr}}{i_{corr}\exp(\frac{αnFE}{RT})}$

$E_{corr} = E + \frac{RT}{αnF}ln\frac{1}{\exp(\frac{αnFE}{RT})}$

$E_{corr} = E - \frac{αnFE}{\beta_c}$

Substituting the given values, we get:

$E_{corr} = E - \frac{0.0609\times1\times96500\times4\times10^{-6}}{0.1}$

$E_{corr} = E - 23.394$

The pH of the solution is given as 3. Using the Nernst equation, we can find the potential of the hydrogen electrode:

$E_{H^+} = E^0_{H^+} - \frac{RT}{nF}ln[H^+]$

The standard hydrogen electrode potential, $E^0_{H^+}$, is 0 V. Substituting the given values, we get:

$E_{H^+} = -\frac{RT}{F}ln[H^+]$

$E_{H^+} = -\frac{8.314\times298}{96500}ln(10^{-3})$

$E_{H^+} = 0.244$

Adding this potential to the corrosion potential, we get:

$E_{acid} = E_{corr} + E_{H^+}$

$E_{acid} = E - 23.394 + 0.244$

$E_{acid} = E - 23.15$

Therefore, the corrosion potential of iron in a dearated acid of pH 3 is 23.15 V, rounded off to two decimal places.

Answer: 

- 23.15 V
