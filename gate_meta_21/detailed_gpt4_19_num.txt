To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of homogeneous nucleation and the critical radius of a nucleus. Homogeneous nucleation refers to the formation of a solid nucleus (a new phase) within a liquid under isothermal conditions without the involvement of any foreign surfaces.

The energy balance for the nucleation process involves the Gibbs free energy change, which has two contributions: the volume free energy change and the surface energy. The Gibbs free energy change for the formation of a nucleus can be given by:

ΔG = (4/3)πr^3*ΔG_V + 4πr^2*γ

Here, r is the radius of the nucleus, ΔG_V is the volume free energy change per unit volume, and γ is the surface energy per unit area.

For a stable nucleus to form, the Gibbs free energy must reach a maximum (dΔG/dr = 0). We can differentiate equation (1) with respect to the radius r:

dΔG/dr = 4πr^2*ΔG_V + 8πr*γ = 0

Solving for r, we get the critical radius r*:

r* = -2γ/ΔG_V

Now, let's consider the given problem:

The surface energy of a nucleus increases by 20%. Therefore, we can write the new surface energy as:

γ_new = γ + 0.2γ = 1.2γ

We also have a critical radius corresponding to the new surface energy:

r*_new = -2γ_new/ΔG_V = -2(1.2γ)/ΔG_V

Now, we need to find the percentage increase in the critical radius:

Percentage increase = [(r*_new - r*) / r*] * 100%

Substituting the expressions for r* and r*_new:

Percentage increase = [(-2(1.2γ)/ΔG_V - (-2γ/ΔG_V)) / (-2γ/ΔG_V)] * 100%

Simplifying the expression:

Percentage increase = [(0.2γ)/γ] * 100% = 20%

Therefore, the corresponding increase in the critical radius of the nucleus is approximately 20%. The answer should be written inside a list as requested:
