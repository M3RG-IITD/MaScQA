Ferrite is a solid solution of carbon in iron and has a body-centered cubic (BCC) crystal structure. Ferrite is the most ductile and softest form of iron and is therefore used in some stainless steel grades. Ferrite stabilizers are elements or compounds that promote the formation of ferrite over austenite or promote the retention of ferrite at high temperatures. 

Out of the given options, (A) Nickel, (B) Manganese, (D) Silicon are ferrite stabilizers, while (C) Carbon is an austenite stabilizer. 

Nickel is a strong ferrite stabilizer and is often used in austenitic stainless steel grades to prevent the formation of harmful phases such as sigma phase, which can reduce the corrosion resistance of stainless steels. Nickel also increases the toughness and ductility of stainless steels.

Manganese is a weaker ferrite stabilizer than Nickel, but it is still effective in promoting the formation of ferrite in steel. Manganese also improves the hardenability and strength of steel and is often added in small amounts to low-carbon steels.

Silicon is a moderate ferrite stabilizer and is often added to austenitic stainless steels to improve their high-temperature resistance. Silicon also increases the electrical resistivity and magnetic permeability of steel.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Nickel. 

Answer: 
- Nickel
