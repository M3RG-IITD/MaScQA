We can use the equation for temperature dependence of vacancy concentration to solve this problem:

$ln(\frac{N_v}{N}) = \frac{-Q_v}{RT}$

where $N_v$ is the concentration of vacancies, $N$ is the total number of lattice sites, $Q_v$ is the enthalpy of vacancy formation, $R$ is the gas constant, and $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.

We are given that the vacancy concentration doubles upon increasing the temperature from 27°C to 127°C. Since concentration is proportional to $N_v/N$, we can write:

$\frac{N_{v2}}{N} = 2 \cdot \frac{N_{v1}}{N}$

Taking the natural log of both sides, we get:

$ln(\frac{N_{v2}}{N}) = ln(2) + ln(\frac{N_{v1}}{N})$

Substituting this expression into our equation, we get:

$ln(2) = \frac{-Q_v}{R} (\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1})$

Plugging in the given temperatures and gas constant, we get:

$ln(2) = \frac{-Q_v}{8.314} (\frac{1}{400} - \frac{1}{300})$

Solving for $Q_v$, we get:

$Q_v = \frac{-8.314 \cdot ln(2)}{\frac{1}{400} - \frac{1}{300}} = 113.13 KJ/mol$

Rounding off to two decimal places, the enthalpy of vacancy formation is 113.13 KJ/mol.
