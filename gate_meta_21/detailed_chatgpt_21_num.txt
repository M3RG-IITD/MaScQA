We can use Bragg's Law to solve this problem. 

Bragg's Law states that for a given set of crystal planes separated by distance "d", constructive interference (reflection) will occur when the following condition is satisfied:

2d sin(θ) = nλ

where:

- θ is the Bragg angle
- n is an integer (1, 2, 3, etc.), which represents the order of the reflection (first, second, third, etc.)
- λ is the wavelength of the incident X-rays.

For a FCC crystal, the (hkl) planes are given by the following equation:

h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = n^2

where h, k, and l are the Miller indices of the plane.

For the first reflection, we know that θ = 30°. We also know that for the first order of reflection (n=1), the Miller indices can be (111), (200), (220), etc.

Let's use the (111) plane as an example:

From the equation for the (hkl) planes of a FCC crystal, we can see that for the (111) plane, h=k=l=1. Therefore, the distance between adjacent (111) planes can be calculated using the following equation:

d = a / sqrt(3)

where a is the lattice constant (distance between adjacent atoms in the FCC crystal).

For the second reflection (n=2), we are looking for the Bragg angle (θ) for a set of crystal planes that are twice as far apart as the (111) planes. Therefore, the Miller indices for this reflection can be (222), (400), (440), etc.

Let's use the (222) plane as an example:

From the equation for the (hkl) planes of a FCC crystal, we can see that for the (222) plane, h=k=l=2. Therefore, the distance between adjacent (222) planes can be calculated using the following equation:

d' = a / sqrt(2)

where d' is the distance between adjacent (222) planes.

Now, we can use Bragg's Law to find the Bragg angle (θ) for the second order of reflection:

2d' sin(θ') = 2λ

Substituting the values for d' and λ, we get:

2(a / sqrt(2)) sin(θ') = 2λ

Simplifying, we get:

sin(θ') = λ / (a / sqrt(2))

We know the value of λ for X-rays is typically around 1 angstrom (10^-10 meters). We can assume a lattice constant for the FCC crystal, such as a = 5 angstroms.

Substituting these values, we get:

sin(θ') = 1 / (5 / sqrt(2)) = 0.2828

Taking the inverse sine of both sides, we get:

θ' = sin^-1(0.2828) = 16.4°

Therefore, the Bragg angle (θ) for the second reflection (n=2) is approximately 16.4°.
