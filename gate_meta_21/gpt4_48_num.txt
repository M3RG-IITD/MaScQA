In the case of plane strain, we have ε(zz) = 0. We also know that:

ε(xx) = (1/E) * [σ(xx) - ν * (σ(yy) + σ(zz))] (1)
ε(yy) = (1/E) * [σ(yy) - ν * (σ(xx) + σ(zz))] (2)
ε(zz) = (1/E) * [σ(zz) - ν * (σ(xx) + σ(yy))] (3)

Given that ε(zz) = 0, and σ(xx) = σ(yy), we have:

0 = (1/E) * [σ(zz) - ν * (σ(xx) + σ(xx))] (4)

We are interested in finding the ratio σ(zz) / σ(xx). We can rearrange equation 4:

σ(zz) = ν * (σ(xx) + σ(xx))
σ(zz) = 2 * ν * σ(xx)
σ(zz) / σ(xx) = 2 * ν

Given that Poisson's ratio, ν = 0.3, we have:

σ(zz) / σ(xx) = 2 * 0.3 = 0.6

The ratio of σ(zz) / σ(xx) is 0.6. Therefore, the answer is [0.6].
