The shear stress exerted by the fluid on the tube wall can be calculated using the formula: τ = μ(dv_z/dr)

Where:
τ = Shear stress
μ = viscosity
dv_z/dr = gradient of axial velocity

Differentiating the given velocity formula with respect to r, we get:

dv_z/dr = -[ΔP/(2Lμ)] * r

Substituting dv_z/dr in the formula for shear stress, we get:

τ = -ΔP/(2L) * r

The negative sign indicates that the direction of the shear stress is opposite to the direction of flow.

Integrating this equation over the radius from 0 to R, we get:

τ = -ΔP/(2L) * R^2 /2

τ = -ΔP*R^2/(4L)

Taking the magnitude, we get:

τ = ΔP*R^2/(4L)

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 2ΔPR/L.
