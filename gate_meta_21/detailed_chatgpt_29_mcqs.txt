The degree of freedom is a thermodynamic concept that indicates the number of independent variables that can be changed without disturbing the system's equilibrium.

For a reacting system involving pure solids and pure liquids,

$f = C - P + 1$

where f is the degrees of freedom, C is the number of components, and P is the number of phases.

In this case, we have one pure solid (M(s)), one pure gas ($CO_2$(g)), one pure liquid (MO(s)), and one gas phase (CO(g)). Thus, we have:

C = 2 components (M and $CO_2$)
P = 2 phases (solid and gas)

Therefore, the degrees of freedom can be calculated as follows:

$f = C - P + 1$
  = 2 - 2 + 1
  = 1

Hence, the correct answer is (B) 1.
