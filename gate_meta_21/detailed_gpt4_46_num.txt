Given the information, we can calculate the glide force on the screw dislocation caused by the edge dislocation. We are given the formula for the shear stress component $τ_(xy)$: 

$τ_(xy)$ = [Gb/(2π(1-v))]*[x($x^2$ - $y^2$)/$($x^2$ + $y^2$)^2$]

Where G is the shear modulus, b is the Burger's vector, x and y are the coordinates of the point at which the stress is being calculated, and v is the Poisson's ratio. We also know the distance between the dislocations, and we can use this to calculate the glide force.

First, we substitute the given values:

$τ_(xy)$ = [(28 * 10^9 N/m^2) * (0.29 * 10^{-9}m)/(2π(1-0.3))]*[x($x^2$ - $y^2$)/$($x^2$ + $y^2$)^2$]

Now, we need to consider the coordinate system. The edge dislocation is on the x-axis, and the screw dislocation is on the y-axis. Given the distance between the dislocations as 0.5nm = 0.5 * 10^{-9}m, we can set x = 0 and y = 0.5 * 10^{-9}m.

$τ_(xy)$ = [(28 * 10^9 N/m^2) * (0.29 * 10^{-9}m)/(2π(1-0.3))]*[$-$($0.5^2$ * $10^{-18}m^2$)/$($0.5^2$ * $10^{-18}m^2$)^2$]

Now we need to simplify this expression:

$τ_(xy)$ = (28 * 0.29 * 10^9 * 10^{-9} N/m^2)/(2π(1-0.3)) * ($-$0.25 * 10^{-18}m^2)/(0.25^2 * 10^{-18} * 10^{-18} m^4)

$τ_(xy)$ = (8.12 * 10^0)/(2π(0.7)) * ($-$1)/1

$τ_(xy)$ = -$-$114.64 N/m^2

Now that we have the shear stress component, we can calculate the force exerted on the screw dislocation. Since the dislocations are on the x-z plane and parallel to the z-axis, the force will be in the x-direction. 

The glide force can be calculated by multiplying the shear stress with the area of dislocations. It's not clear what the dimensions of the dislocation lines are from the problem statement, but we can write the general formula for the force:

Force = $τ_(xy)$ * Area of the dislocation lines

We can see that the glide force exerted by the edge dislocation on the screw dislocation will be around 114.64 times the area of the dislocation lines, in Newtons (N). Since we don't have the dimensions of the dislocation lines, we can't give a specific numeric answer.

However, based on the information provided in the question, we can conclude that the glide force on the screw dislocation will be positive due to the edge dislocation (- multiplied by - gives +), and it will be in the x-direction. The magnitude of the force will be around 114.64 times the area of the dislocation lines.
