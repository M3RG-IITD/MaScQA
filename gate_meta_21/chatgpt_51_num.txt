The equation for Fick's second law is given as:
D * (C2 - C1) / (2 * t) = x

where,
D = Diffusivity of carbon in γ-Fe at 950°C = 1.6 * $10^(-11)m^(2)s^(-1)
C1 = Initial carbon concentration = 0.1 wt.%
C2 = Final carbon concentration = 0.6 wt.%
t = Time for diffusion = 9 hours = 32400 seconds
x = Distance at which carbon concentration is 0.6 wt.% C

Substituting the values, we get:

1.6 * $10^(-11) * ((0.6 - 0.1) / (2 * 32400)) = x

x = 0.08 mm (approx)

Therefore, the depth at which the carbon concentration is 0.6 wt.% C will be approximately 0.08 mm below the surface. 

Answer: [0.08 mm]
