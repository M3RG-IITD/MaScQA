We are given three reactions:

1) 2Cu(s) + 0.5S₂(g) = Cu₂S(s); ΔG°₁ = -100 kJ
2) SO₂(g) = 0.5S₂(g) + O₂(g); ΔG°₂ = 292 kJ
3) 2Cu(s) + SO₂(g) = Cu₂S(s) + O₂(g); we need to find ln(P_O₂/P_SO₂) for this reaction at 973 K

First, we need to find reaction 3 from reactions 1 and 2. This can be done by adding the two reactions to eliminate the S₂ species. To do this, we need to multiply reaction 2 by 2:

1) 2Cu(s) + 0.5S₂(g) = Cu₂S(s); ΔG°₁ = -100 kJ
2') 2SO₂(g) = S₂(g) + 2O₂(g); ΔG°₂' = 2 * 292 kJ = 584 kJ

Now we can add reactions 1 and 2':

1+2') 2Cu(s) + 2SO₂(g) = Cu₂S(s) + 2O₂(g); ΔG° = -100 kJ + 584 kJ = 484 kJ

Since we have a stoichiometry of 2 for SO₂ and O₂, we can divide this reaction by 2 to get the desired reaction 3:

3) 2Cu(s) + SO₂(g) = Cu₂S(s) + O₂(g); ΔG°₃ = 484 kJ / 2 = 242 kJ

Now we can use the relationship between ΔG° and the equilibrium constant Kp:

ΔG° = -R * T * ln(Kp)

We know ΔG°₃ (242 kJ), R (8.314 J/mol*K), and T (973K), so we can solve this equation for Kp:

242000 J/mol = -8.314 J/mol*K * 973K * ln(Kp)
ln(Kp) = -242000 / (8.314 * 973) = -3.016

Now we have the equilibrium constant Kp in terms of partial pressures:

Kp = P_O₂ / P_SO₂

But we found ln(Kp) = -3.016, so

P_O₂ / P_SO₂ = e^(-3.016)

Now we need to find ln(P_O₂ / P_SO₂):

ln(P_O₂ / P_SO₂) = -3.016

Thus, the value of ln(P_O₂ / P_SO₂) at 973K for reaction 3 is -3.02 (rounded off to 2 decimal places).

The final answer is [-3.02].
