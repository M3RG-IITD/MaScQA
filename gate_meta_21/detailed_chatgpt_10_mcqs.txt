Quenching Power is the ability of a quenchant to extract heat from the steel during heat treatment. The correct decreasing sequence of Quenching Power for quenchants used in heat treatment of steels is:

(B) Brine> Oil> Water> Air

Here's why:

- Brine is a solution of salt in water, and has the highest quenching power among the options given. This is because the dissolved salt ions can promote rapid cooling by disrupting the formation of insulating bubbles around the steel.
- Oil has a lower quenching power than brine, but is still more effective than water or air. This is because oil can absorb heat from the steel more readily than water or air, due to its higher viscosity.
- Water has a lower quenching power than oil, but is still used for certain types of heat treatment. This is because water can cool the steel more rapidly than air.
- Air has the lowest quenching power among the options given. This is because air is a poor conductor of heat, and can only extract heat from the steel through convection.

Therefore, the correct decreasing sequence of Quenching Power for quenchants used in heat treatment of steels is (B) Brine> Oil> Water> Air.
