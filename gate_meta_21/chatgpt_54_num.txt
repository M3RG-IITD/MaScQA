We can use the square root relationship between weight gain and time to solve the problem. 

Let x be the weight gain (in mg $cm^2$) after a duration of 1600s. 

According to the problem, we know that: 

- Weight gain is proportional to the square root of time. We can write this as:

  weight gain = k * sqrt(time)

  where k is the proportionality constant, which we need to determine. 

- When the temperature is constant (isothermal), the rate of weight gain is constant. In other words, the proportionality constant k does not change. 

Using this information, we can set up a proportion:

weight gain at 400s / sqrt(400) = weight gain at 1600s / sqrt(1600)

2 / 20 = x / 40

Solving for x, we get:

x = 4

Therefore, the weight gain after a duration of 1600s is 4 mg $cm^2$.
