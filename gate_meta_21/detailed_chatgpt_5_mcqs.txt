Single crystal turbine blades of nickel-based superalloys for aero-engines are manufactured using Directional solidification.

Explanation:

Directional solidification is a manufacturing process used for producing single crystal materials. In this process, molten metal or alloy is slowly solidified from one end to the other, with the solidification front moving in a controlled manner through the material. By controlling the temperature gradient and solidification rate, a single crystal can be grown with the desired orientation.

In the case of nickel-based superalloys, single crystal turbine blades are used for their superior high-temperature strength, creep resistance, and fatigue resistance. Directional solidification is the preferred method for manufacturing these blades, as it allows for precise control of the crystal orientation and the formation of a defect-free structure.

Investment casting, die casting, and squeeze casting are also used in the manufacturing of turbine blades, but they are not generally suitable for the production of single crystal materials. Investment casting is a common method for producing complex shapes with high dimensional accuracy, but it does not provide the control needed for single crystal growth. Die casting and squeeze casting are both pressure-based methods that are used for producing parts with good surface finish and dimensional accuracy, but they also do not allow for the formation of single crystal materials.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

- (D) Directional solidification
