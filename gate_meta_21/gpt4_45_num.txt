Unfortunately, I cannot see the image you're referring to, so I cannot directly solve this problem. However, I can explain the general concept and formula for the efficiency of an engine.

The efficiency of an engine is determined by how much work it can do, relative to the heat energy it takes in. In a reversible cycle (Carnot Cycle), the efficiency can be calculated using the following formula:

Efficiency = 1 - (T1 / T2)

In this problem, T1 = 200K and T2 = 600K. Plugging these values into the formula gives:

Efficiency = 1 - (200 / 600)
Efficiency = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3

To express this as a percentage, multiply by 100:

Efficiency = (2/3) * 100 = 66.67%

So, the efficiency of the engine would be approximately 66.67%. Keep in mind that this calculation assumes a reversible (Carnot) cycle, and your actual engine may behave differently if the image shows a different type of cycle.

The answer, rounded to two decimal places, is [66.67].
