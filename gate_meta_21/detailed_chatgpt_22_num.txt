To solve this question, we need to follow the steps below:

Step 1: Determine the phases present at room temperature for a 0.8 wt.% C steel sample using the iron-carbon equilibrium diagram.
 
The iron-carbon equilibrium diagram is shown below:

At 0.8 wt.% C, the eutectoid composition, the phases present at room temperature are 100% pearlite.

Step 2: Determine the phases present at room temperature for a 0.6 wt.% C steel sample using the iron-carbon equilibrium diagram.

At 0.6 wt.% C, the phases present at room temperature are α-ferrite and pearlite.

Step 3: Determine the maximum amount of pearlite that can form in the sample.

The maximum amount of pearlite that can form in the sample can be calculated using lever rule. 

First, we need to calculate the weight percentages of α-ferrite and pearlite in the sample. 

Weight percentage of α-ferrite = (0.6 - 0.025) / (0.8 - 0.025) = 0.719

Weight percentage of pearlite = 1 - 0.719 = 0.281

Now, we can calculate the maximum amount of pearlite that can form in the sample using the lever rule:

Maximum pearlite = (0.281 / 0.87) x 100% = 32.18%

Step 4: Calculate the fraction of proeutectoid ferrite in the microstructure.

Since the maximum amount of pearlite that can form in the sample is 32.18%, the fraction of proeutectoid ferrite in the microstructure is:

Fraction of proeutectoid ferrite = 1 - 32.18% = 67.82%

Therefore, the answer is:

- Fraction of proeutectoid ferrite in the microstructure = 67.82%.
