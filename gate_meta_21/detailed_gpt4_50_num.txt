To find the critical temperature gradient required to maintain a planar solidification front, we can use the following equation from the theory of cellular and dendritic growth:

$G = \cfrac{V}{D}\cfrac{m}{\Delta T}$

Where G is the critical temperature gradient, V is the velocity of the solidification front, D is the diffusivity of B in liquid, m is the slope of the liquidus line at the freezing point of the alloy, and ΔT is the difference between the freezing point of the alloy and the eutectic temperature.

We are given the following values:
- The diffusivity of B in liquid, $D = 10^{-9} m^2 s^{-1}$
- The velocity of the solidification front, $V = 4 \mu m s^{-1} = 4 \times 10^{-6} m s^{-1}$

Now we need to determine the slope of the liquidus line and the difference in temperatures ΔT.

Unfortunately, without the image of the given phase diagram, I cannot determine the exact values for m and ΔT. Nevertheless, I can show you how to proceed once you have those values from the provided image.

1. Measure the slope of the liquidus line at the freezing point of the alloy with 5 wt.% B. This is the value for m.
2. Determine the difference in temperatures between the freezing point of the alloy and the eutectic temperature, as shown in the phase diagram. This is the value for ΔT.

Once you have those values, plug them along with the given values for D and V into the equation to calculate the critical temperature gradient, G:

$G = \cfrac{V}{D}\cfrac{m}{\Delta T}$

After calculating G, round the answer to the nearest integer to obtain the critical temperature gradient in K $mm^{-1}$.

Finally, the correct answer can be written inside the list as: [G].
