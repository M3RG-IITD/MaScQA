First, we need to calculate the heat input per unit length of the weld. 

Heat input per unit length (HI) = Power (P) x Efficiency (η) / Travel speed (v)

Given, P = 3000 W and v = 6 mm/s

To calculate efficiency, we need to consider the heat transfer factor (HTF) and the melting factor (MF) as follows:

Efficiency (η) = HTF x MF 

Given, HTF = 0.6 and MF = 0.5

Therefore, 

η = 0.6 x 0.5 = 0.3

Substituting the given values, we get:

HI = 3000 x 0.3 / 6 = 150 J/mm

Next, we need to find the volume of metal melted per unit length of the weld. 

The volume of metal melted per unit length (VM) = Cross-sectional area (A) x Depth of fusion (DF)

Given, Depth of fusion (DF) is not given in the question. 

Assuming a conservative value of DF = 0.5 times the thickness of the metal to be welded, we can calculate the cross-sectional area (A) as follows:

Thickness of metal to be welded (T) = 2 mm (as it is not given in the question, let's assume the thickness to be 2 mm)

Depth of fusion (DF) = 0.5 x 2 = 1 mm

The cross-sectional area (A) of the weld = (T/2) x DF

A = (2/2) x 1 = 1 $mm^2$

Therefore, 

VM = A x DF = 1 x 1 = 1 $mm^3$/mm

Finally, we can calculate the length of weld that can be made for a given energy input. 

Energy required to melt the metal per unit volume (E) = 6 J/mm$^3$ (given)

Energy input per unit length (HI) = 150 J/mm (calculated above)

Length of weld per unit energy (L) = E/HI = 6/150 = 0.04 mm/J

Therefore, 

Length of weld that can be made for 3000 J of energy input = 0.04 x 3000 = 120 mm

The cross-sectional area (A) of the weld = 1 $mm^2$

Therefore, the answer is:
