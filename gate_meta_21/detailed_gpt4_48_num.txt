To find the ratio of σ_zz / σ_xx, we need to use the following equations of stress-strain relation in the context of linear elasticity:

1) σ_xx = E * (ε_xx + ν * (ε_yy + ε_zz))
2) σ_yy = E * (ε_yy + ν * (ε_xx + ε_zz))

Here,
σ_xx: stress in x direction
σ_yy: stress in y direction
σ_zz: stress in z direction
ε_xx: strain in x direction
ε_yy: strain in y direction
ε_zz: strain in z direction (note that ε_zz = 0 because of plane strain conditions)
ν: Poisson's ratio (given 0.3)
E: elastic modulus (Young's modulus)

Since σ_xx = σ_yy, we can construct a new equation:
σ_xx = σ_yy 
E * (ε_xx + ν * (ε_yy + ε_zz)) = E * (ε_yy + ν * (ε_xx + ε_zz))

We have ε_zz = 0, so the equation becomes:
E * (ε_xx + ν * ε_yy) = E * (ε_yy + ν * ε_xx)

Divide both sides by E:
ε_xx + ν * ε_yy = ε_yy + ν * ε_xx

Rearranging the terms, we get:
ε_xx - ν * ε_xx = ε_yy - ν * ε_yy

Taking the common factor out:
(1 - ν) * ε_xx = (1 - ν) * ε_yy

Now, divide both sides by (1 - ν):
ε_xx = ε_yy

Now we have to use the Poisson's Ratio formula:
ν = - (ε_zz / ε_xx)

We know the Poisson's ratio is 0.3 and ε_zz = 0 so:
0.3 = - (0 / ε_xx)

This equation implies that ε_xx is non-zero, which means the strain in the x direction exists.

Now, let's go back to the stress equations (1 and 2) and use the information we have found:

σ_xx = E * (ε_xx + ν * ε_yy) = E * ε_xx * (1 + ν)
σ_yy = E * (ε_yy + ν * ε_xx) = E * ε_yy * (1 + ν)

Since σ_xx = σ_yy:
E * ε_xx * (1 + ν) = E * ε_yy * (1 + ν)

Divide both sides by E * (1 + ν):
ε_xx = ε_yy

We already know this, and we know the plane stress condition (ε_zz = 0) and Poisson's ratio (ν = 0.3). Therefore, the ratio of σ_zz / σ_xx is:

σ_zz / σ_xx = 0 / σ_xx
Since σ_xx is non-zero, the ratio becomes 0.

So, the ratio of σ_zz / σ_xx is approximately:
