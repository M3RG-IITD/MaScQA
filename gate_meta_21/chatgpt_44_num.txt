We can use the formula for work done in reversible adiabatic process:

$W = \frac{nC_p}{\gamma - 1}(T_i - T_f)$

where $n$ is the number of moles, $C_p$ is the molar heat capacity at constant pressure, $\gamma$ is the ratio of specific heats ($C_p/C_v$) and $T_i$ and $T_f$ are the initial and final temperatures. 

We are given that $n=1$, $C_p = 2.5R$, $\gamma = 5/3$ (for an ideal monoatomic gas) and $T_i = 300K$. We need to find $T_f$ to calculate the work done. 

To find $T_f$, we can use the formula for reversible adiabatic expansion:

$TV^{\gamma - 1} = constant$

At the beginning of the process, $P_1V_1 = nRT$, where $P_1 = 10atm$ and $V_1$ can be calculated using $PV = nRT$. Similarly, at the end of the process, $P_2 = 1atm$ and $V_2$ can be calculated using $P_2V_2 = nRT_f$. 

$TV^{\gamma - 1} = constant$ can be written as $T = \frac{constant}{V^{\gamma - 1}}$. Substituting the initial and final conditions, we get:

$T_iV_1^{\gamma - 1} = T_fV_2^{\gamma - 1}$

Substituting $V_1 = \frac{nRT_1}{P_1}$ and $V_2 = \frac{nRT_f}{P_2}$ and simplifying, we get:

$T_f = T_i \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma}}$

Substituting the given values, we get:

$T_f = 300\left(\frac{1}{10}\right)^{\frac{2}{5}} \approx 188K$

Now we can calculate the work done:

$W = \frac{C_p}{\gamma - 1}(T_i - T_f) \approx 2181 \text{Joules} \approx 2180 \text{Joules}$ (rounded off to nearest integer)

Therefore, the work done by the gas is approximately 2180 Joules.
