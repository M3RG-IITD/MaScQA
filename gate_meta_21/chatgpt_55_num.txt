Since we are interested in the view factor $F_{22}$, the question is asking us for the fraction of radiation leaving surface 2 that is intercepted by surface 2 itself. This means that we need to calculate the area on surface 2 that can "see" surface 2 itself, and divide this area by the total area of surface 2. 

The easiest way to visualize this is to imagine a tiny surface element $\text{d}A_2$ on surface 2. We want to calculate the fraction of radiation leaving $\text{d}A_2$ that gets intercepted by any part of surface 2. In other words, we want to find the solid angle $\text{d}\Omega_{21}$ that covers surface 2 and has $\text{d}A_2$ at its center. The view factor $F_{22}$ is then the total radiation intercepted by surface 2, divided by the radiation leaving surface 2.

Since we are dealing with spheres, we can use the formula for solid angles subtended by a sphere, which is:

$$\text{d}\Omega = \frac{\text{d}A}{r^2}$$

where $\text{d}A$ is the area subtended by the solid angle, and $r$ is the radius of the sphere.

In this case, $\text{d}A_2$ is just a point, so its area is zero, and the solid angle subtended by it is also zero. This means that $F_{22} = 0$. 

Therefore, the answer is:

- $F_{22} = 0$
