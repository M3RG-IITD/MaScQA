The formula for the velocity of a fully developed 1-D flow of Newtonian fluid through a horizontal pipe of radius R is given by:

$v_z = \frac{\Delta P}{L} \frac{R^2 - r^2}{4\mu}$

where ΔP is the pressure difference (P1- P2), µ is the viscosity, r is the radial distance from the axis and L is the length of the tube.

The shear stress exerted by the fluid on the tube wall is given by:

$\tau = \mu \frac{\partial v_z}{\partial r}$

We can find $\frac{\partial v_z}{\partial r}$ by taking the partial derivative of $v_z$ with respect to r:

$\frac{\partial v_z}{\partial r} = \frac{\Delta P}{L} \frac{-2r}{4\mu}$

Plugging this into the formula for shear stress, we get:

$\tau = \mu \frac{\Delta P}{L} \frac{-2r}{4\mu} = -\frac{\Delta P r}{2L}$

The negative sign indicates that the direction of the shear stress is opposite to the direction of the flow.

Therefore, the answer is (A) ΔPR/(2L).
