Given that weight gain is proportional to the square root of time, we can write a proportionality equation as:

Weight gain ∝ √(time)

Let's denote weight gain as "W" and time as "t". Then, we can introduce a constant of proportionality, "k," to form an equation:

W = k * √(t)

We're given that when nickel undergoes isothermal oxidation at 800 K for a duration of 400 s, it results in a weight gain of 2 mg per square centimeter. Using this information, we can solve for the constant of proportionality, k:

2 mg cm^(-2) = k * √(400 s)

Since √(400 s) = 20 s^(1/2), we can now solve for k:

k = (2 mg cm^(-2)) / (20 s^(1/2))

k = 0.1 mg cm^(-2) s^(-1/2)

Now we're asked to find the weight gain after a duration of 1600 s. To do this, we can plug t = 1600 s into our equation for weight gain:

W = (0.1 mg cm^(-2) s^(-1/2)) * √(1600 s)

Since √(1600 s) = 40 s^(1/2), we can now calculate W:

W = (0.1 mg cm^(-2) s^(-1/2)) * (40 s^(1/2))

W = 4 mg cm^(-2)

Rounding off to the nearest integer, the weight gain after a duration of 1600s is approximately 4 mg cm^(-2).

So the correct answer is [4].
