We can use Fick's Second Law to solve this problem.

Fick’s Second Law: 

$ \frac{\partial C}{\partial t}=D \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial x^2} $

where,
C is the concentration of carbon
D is the diffusivity of carbon in γ-Fe
t is time
x is distance from the surface

To solve the problem, we can start by finding the value of the concentration gradient, ∇C.

$ \nabla C = \frac{C_s - C_0}{x} $

where,
C_s is the surface concentration of carbon = 1.1 wt.% C
C_0 is the initial concentration of carbon = 0.1 wt.% C
x is the distance from the surface

$ \nabla C = \frac{1.1 - 0.1}{0} $

$ \nabla C = 10 $

Therefore, the concentration gradient is 10 wt.% C/mm.

Next, we can find the value of the diffusion coefficient, D.

D = 1.6 * $10^(-11) m^(2)s^(-1) $

To use this value in Fick's Second Law, we need to convert it to mm^(2)/s.

1 m = 1000 mm

$ D = 1.6 * 10^(-11) * (1000)^2 $

$ D = 1.6 * $10^(-5) mm^(2)/s

Now, we can use Fick's Second Law to find the distance, x, at which the carbon concentration is 0.6 wt.% C.

$ \frac{\partial C}{\partial t} = 1.6 * 10^(-5) \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial x^2} $

$ \frac{\partial C}{\partial t} = D \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial x^2} $

$ \frac{\partial C}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(D \frac{\partial C}{\partial x}) $

Assuming that the concentration profile is one-dimensional, we can solve the above equation using the method of separation of variables.

Let,

$ C(x,t) = F(x)G(t) $

$ \frac{\partial C}{\partial t} = FG' $

$ \frac{\partial C}{\partial x} = F'G $

$ \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial x^2} = F''G $

Substituting these values in the previous equation,

$ FG' = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(D F''G) $

$ FG' = D F''G' $

$ \frac{F''}{F} = \frac{G'}{DG} $

Since the left side of the equation depends only on x and the right side depends only on t, both sides should be equal to a constant value, say -λ^2.

$ \frac{F''}{F} = -\lambda^2 $

$ F'' + \lambda^2 F = 0 $

The general solution of the above differential equation is,

$ F(x) = A cos(\lambda x) + B sin(\lambda x) $

where A and B are constants to be determined by the boundary conditions.

At x = 0, C = 1.1 wt.% C.


$ F(0) = A = 1.1 $

At x = ∞, C = 0.1 wt.% C.

$ \lim_{x\to\infty}F(x) = 0 $

Therefore, B = 0.

Hence,

$ F(x) = 1.1 cos(\lambda x) $

Next, we can find the value of λ.

At t = 9 hours,

$ C(x,9) = 0.6 $

$ F(x)G(9) = 0.6 $

$ F(x) = 0.6/G(9) $

Substituting the value of F(x) in the expression for F(x),

$ 1.1 cos(\lambda x) = \frac{0.6}{G(9)} $

At t = 0,

$ C(x,0) = 0.1 $

$ F(x)G(0) = 0.1 $

$ F(x) = 0.1/G(0) $

Substituting the value of F(x) in the expression for F(x),

$ 1.1 cos(\lambda x) = \frac{0.1}{G(0)} $

Dividing the above two equations, we get,

$ \frac{cos(\lambda x)}{cos(\lambda x)} = \frac{0.1/G(0)}{0.6/G(9)} $

$ 1 = 6 \frac{G(0)}{G(9)} $

$ G(9) = 6 G(0) $

The solution of the differential equation for G(t) is,

$ G(t) = exp(-\lambda^2 D t) $

Substituting the value of λ in the above equation,

$ G(t) = exp(-(\pi/2)^2 D t) $

Substituting the boundary condition at t = 0,

$ G(0) = 1 $

Substituting the boundary condition at t = 9 hours,

$ G(9) = 6 $

$ exp(-(\pi/2)^2 D t) = 6 $

$ (\pi/2)^2 D t = ln(6) $

$ t = \frac{ln(6)}{(\pi/2)^2 D} $

Substituting the given values of D and solving for t,

$ t = \frac{ln(6)}{(\pi/2)^2 * 1.6 * 10^(-5)} $

$ t = 41.85 h $

Therefore, the depth at which the carbon concentration is 0.6 wt.% C will be,

$ x = \frac{\pi}{2} * \sqrt{Dt} $

$ x = \frac{\pi}{2} * \sqrt{1.6 * 10^(-5) * 41.85*3600} $

$ x = 1.18 mm $

Rounding off the answer to 2 decimal places,

Answer: [1.18] mm.
