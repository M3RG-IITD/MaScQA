We are given the following equation

2Cu(s) + $SO_2$(g) = $Cu_2$S(s) + $O_2$(g)

We know that the equilibrium constant K is equal to the product of the concentrations of the products raised to their stoichiometric coefficients divided by the product of the concentrations of the reactants raised to their stoichiometric coefficients.

K = [Cu2S][O2] / [$SO_2$]$^2$ [Cu]^2

From thermodynamics, we know that ΔG°, the standard free energy change, is related to the equilibrium constant K by the equation:

ΔG° = - R T ln(K)

where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin and ln is the natural logarithm.

We are given the value of ΔG° for the first equation 2Cu(s) + 0.5$S_2$(g) = $Cu_2$S(s) as -100 kJ at 973 K.

We can use this to find the standard free energy change for the given equation 2Cu(s) + $SO_2$(g) = $Cu_2$S(s) + $O_2$(g).

ΔG° = ΔH° - T ΔS°

where ΔH° is the standard enthalpy change and ΔS° is the standard entropy change.

We can simplify the equation by assuming that the standard entropy of the solid Cu and $Cu_2S$ are both zero.

ΔG° = ΔH°

We can find ΔH° by using Hess's Law. We can write the given equation as the sum of two equations as follows:

2Cu(s) + 0.5$S_2$(g) = $Cu_2$S(s) ΔH°1

$Cu_2$S(s) + 1.5$O_2$(g) = 2Cu(s) + $SO_2$(g) ΔH°2

We can reverse equation 1 and multiply it by -1 to get the desired stoichiometry:

$Cu_2$S(s) = 2Cu(s) + 0.5$S_2$(g) ΔH°-1

We can add this equation with equation 2 to obtain the overall equation:

2Cu(s) + $SO_2$(g) = $Cu_2$S(s) + $O_2$(g)

ΔH°overall = ΔH°2 + ΔH°-1

We can use the given value of ΔG° for equation 1 to find ΔH°-1 as follows:

ΔG°1 = - R T ln(K1)

K1 = [$Cu_2$S] / [Cu]$^2$ [$SO_2$]$^0.5$

ln(K1) = ln([$Cu_2$S]) - 2 ln([Cu]) - 0.5 ln([$SO_2$])

ΔG°1 = - R T ln([$Cu_2$S]) + 2 R T ln([Cu]) + 0.5 R T ln([$SO_2$])

-100000 = - 8.314 * 973 * ln([$Cu_2$S]) + 2 * 8.314 * 973 * ln([Cu]) + 0.5 * 8.314 * 973 * ln([$SO_2$])

ln([$Cu_2$S]) = (2 ln([Cu]) + 0.5 ln([$SO_2$]) - 120.926) / -24.271

ln([$Cu_2$S]) = -1.782 ln([Cu]) - 0.207 ln([$SO_2$]) + 4.98

Using the given value of ΔG° for equation 2, we can find ΔH°2 as follows:

ΔG°2 = - R T ln(K2)

K2 = [Cu]$^2$ [$SO_2$] / [$Cu_2$S][O2]

ln(K2) = 2 ln([Cu]) + ln([$SO_2$]) - ln([$Cu_2$S]) - ln([O2])

ΔG°2 = - R T ln([Cu]$^2$ [$SO_2$] / [$Cu_2$S][O2])

292000 = - 8.314 * 973 * ln([Cu]$^2$ [$SO_2$] / [$Cu_2$S][O2])

ln([$Cu_2$S]/[O2]) = ln([Cu]$^2$ [$SO_2$]) / 3.100

ln([$Cu_2$S]/[O2]) = 2 ln([Cu]) + ln([$SO_2$]) - 45.008

ΔH°2 = -292000 J/mol

Thus, the overall enthalpy change for the given equation is:

ΔH°overall = -292000 - 9314

ΔH°overall = -301314 J/mol

Now, we can use the equation to find ln(K):

ΔG° = - R T ln(K)

-301314 = - 8.314 * 973 * ln(K)

ln(K) = 38.793

Finally, we can use the equation for ln(K) to find ln($P_(O_2)$/$P_(SO_2)$):

ln(K) = ln($P_(O_2)$/$P_(SO_2)$) + ln(RT/$P°$)$^Δn_r$

where $P°$ is the reference pressure (1 atm), Δ$n_r$ is the difference in the number of moles of gas products and gas reactants, which is equal to 1 in this case.

ln($P_(O_2)$/$P_(SO_2)$) = ln(K) - ln(RT/$P°$)

ln($P_(O_2)$/$P_(SO_2)$) = 38.793 - ln(8.314 * 973 / 101325)

ln($P_(O_2)$/$P_(SO_2)$) = 23.575

Therefore, the value of ln($P_(O_2)$/$P_(SO_2)$) at 973K is 23.58 (rounded off to 2 decimal places).
