We can first calculate the number of components, which is the minimum number of independently variable entities required to define the state of the system. Here, we have 4 species (M, $CO_2$, MO, CO) but they are related by stoichiometry, so we have only two components. 

Next, we calculate the number of phases. We have one solid (M), one gas ($CO_2$), one solid oxide (MO), and one gas (CO), so we have two phases. 

Finally, we apply the Gibbs phase rule, which states: 

F = C - P + 2 

where F is the degrees of freedom, C is the number of components, and P is the number of phases. 

Plugging in our values, we get: 

F = 2 - 2 + 2 = 2 

Therefore, the answer is (C) 2. 

Answer: 
(C) 2
