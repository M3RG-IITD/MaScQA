First, we need to find the shear stress due to the edge dislocation. Using the given formula,
$\tau_{xy} = \frac{Gb}{2\pi(1-v)}\left[\frac{x(x^2-y^2)}{(x^2+y^2)^2}\right]$

We also know that $\tau_{xy}$ represents the shear stress component in the xy plane, and is normal to the x-axis. Since both dislocations are parallel to the z-axis, this means that only the y-component of the shear stress will contribute to the force between the dislocations.

Using trigonometry, we can determine that the angle between the two dislocations is $\theta = \arctan\left(\frac{y}{0.5\text{ nm}}\right)$.

The force per unit length $f_{y}$ that the edge dislocation exerts on the screw dislocation is given by:

$f_y = \frac{\mu b}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\partial \tau_{xy}}{\partial y}dydz$

Since the dislocations are parallel to the z-axis, we can integrate over z:
$f_y = \frac{\mu b}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\partial \tau_{xy}}{\partial y}dy \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}dz$

The second integral simply evaluates to the distance between the two dislocations, $d = 0.5$ nm.

Now, we evaluate the first integral using the shear stress formula:

$\frac{\partial \tau_{xy}}{\partial y} = \frac{Gb}{2\pi(1-v)}\left[\frac{x(3y^2-x^2)}{(x^2+y^2)^3}\right]$

$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\partial \tau_{xy}}{\partial y}dy = \frac{Gb}{2\pi(1-v)}\left[\frac{1}{x}\right]$

Substituting this back into the expression for $f_y$:
$f_y = \frac{\mu b}{2\pi}\cdot\frac{Gb}{2\pi(1-v)}\cdot\frac{1}{x}\cdot d$

Substituting the given values, we get:
$f_y = \frac{(2)(3.14)(0.029\text{ nm})(28\text{ GPa})}{2(3.14)(0.7)}\cdot\frac{1}{x}\cdot(0.5\text{ nm})$

Simplifying and converting to Newtons:
$f_y = 42.33\frac{\text{N}}{\text{m}}\cdot\frac{1}{x}$

Rounding off to the nearest integer for $x = 0.3$ nm, we get:
$f_y = \boxed{141}\text{ N}$
