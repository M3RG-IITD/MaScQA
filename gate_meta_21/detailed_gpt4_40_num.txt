We are given the following:
- Unit energy required to melt the metal: 6 J $mm^{-3}$
- Heat transfer factor: 0.6
- Melting factor: 0.5
- Power of the welding machine: 3000 W
- Travel speed: 6 mm $s^{-1}$

Our goal is to find the cross-sectional area of the weld in $mm^2$.

First, we need to find the total energy input during the welding process. Since we know the power of the welding machine is 3000 W, and we are given the travel speed, we can find the energy input per second.

Total energy input per second = Power of the welding machine * Heat transfer factor * Melting factor
Total energy input per second = 3000 W * 0.6 * 0.5

Total energy input per second = 900 J $s^(-1)$

Now we need to calculate how much volume of the metal is melted per second. To do this, we can use the travel speed and the unit energy required to melt the metal.

Melting energy per second = Total energy input per second / Unit energy required to melt the metal
Melting energy per second = 900 J $s^(-1)$ / 6 J $mm^{-3}$

Melting energy per second = 150 $mm^3 s^(-1)$

Now we have the volume of the metal melted per second. To find the cross-sectional area of the weld, we can divide the melted volume per second by the travel speed.

Cross-sectional area of the weld = Melting energy per second / Travel speed
Cross-sectional area of the weld = 150 $mm^3 s^(-1)$ / 6 mm $s^(-1)$

Cross-sectional area of the weld = 25 $mm^2$

Rounding off to the nearest integer, the cross-sectional area of the weld is 25 $mm^2$.

So the correct answer is: [25].
