The correct answer is (B) Increase in concentration of reacting species increases the rate of reaction, which is FALSE.

Explanation:

For a zeroth order reaction:

Rate of reaction = -d[A]/dt = k

where [A] is the concentration of the reactant, t is time, and k is the rate constant.

Integrating the above equation, we get:

[A] = -kt + [A]₀

where [A]₀ is the initial concentration of the reactant.

This equation shows that the concentration of the reactant decreases linearly with time, which means that the concentration versus time plot is a straight line with a negative slope.

The rate of reaction is independent of the concentration of the reactant for a zeroth order reaction, which means that increasing the concentration of the reacting species does not increase the rate of reaction. This is the false statement in the given options.

The half-life of a zeroth order reaction can be calculated using the following equation:

t₁/₂ = [A]₀/2k

This equation shows that the half-life depends on the initial concentration and the zero-order rate constant.

The rate of reaction for any chemical reaction depends on temperature, which means that the statement (D) Rate of reaction depends on temperature is true.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Increase in concentration of reacting species increases the rate of reaction, which is FALSE. 

Answer: 
(B) Increase in concentration of reacting species increases the rate of reaction
