First, we need to find the weight of $Fe_2O_3$ and pure Fe in 1 ton of hot metal. Since the composition of hot metal is 95.5% Fe and 4.5% C, we have:

1 ton of hot metal = 1000 kg

Weight of Fe in hot metal = (95.5/100) * 1000 = 955 kg

From the composition of hematite ore, we have 80% $Fe_2O_3$. To calculate the weight of $Fe_2O_3$, we will use the stoichiometry of the reaction:

Fe_2O_3 + 3C -> 2Fe + 3CO
(16*3 + 56*2) g of $Fe_2O_3$ -> 56*2 g of Fe

When calculating the weight of $Fe_2O_3$:

(160/112) * 955 = 1360 kg of $Fe_2O_3$

Now, we will find the weight of iron ore necessary to produce 1 ton of hot metal:

Let x = weight of iron ore used

80% * x = 1360

x = 1700 kg

Next, we need to find the weight of slag produced per ton of hot metal. The slag is formed from the gangue materials of the ore and the ash content of coke.

Weight of gangue materials (20% of iron ore) = (20/100) * 1700 = 340 kg
Weight of ash content of coke (15% of coke) = (15/100) * 600 = 90 kg

The weight of slag produced per ton of hot metal is the sum of these two components:

Weight of slag = 340 + 90 = 430 kg

So, the weight of iron ore used and slag produced per ton of hot metal is 1700 kg and 430 kg, respectively. The closest option to the calculated values is (A). Therefore, the answer is:

(A) 1705 kg, 431 kg
