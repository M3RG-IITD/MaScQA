To find corrosion potential, we will use the Tafel equation for hydrogen reduction on cathodic surface, given by:

$E = E^0 - \frac{2.3 * R * T}{n * F} * (log_{10}\frac{i}{i^0})$

where
$E$ is the corrosion potential,
$E^0$ is the standard electrode potential (which is 0 for Standard Hydrogen Electrode),
$R$ is the gas constant = 8.314 J $mol^(-1)K^(-1)$,
$T$ is the temperature in Kelvin = 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K,
$n$ is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction (2 for hydrogen),
$F$ is the Faraday constant = 96500 C $mol^(-1)$,
$i$ is the corrosion current density = 4 µA $cm^(-2)$ = 4 × 10^(-6) A $cm^(-2)$,
and $i^0$ is the exchange current density = 10^(-9) A $cm^(-2)$.

A given value ($β_c$ = 0.1 V per decade of current density) will be used to find the relationship between Tafel slope and the rate constant $2.3 * \frac{RT}{n * F}$.
From $β_c$ = 0.1 V per decade of current density, we have:

$0.1 = 2.3 * \frac{RT}{n * F}$

Now we can compute for the Tafel slope:

$2.3 * \frac{RT}{n * F} = \frac{R * T \cdot 0.1}{n * F}$

Now we substitute the values and find the corrosion potential:

$E = E^0 - \frac{2.3 * R * T}{n * F} * (log_{10}\frac{i}{i^0})$

$E = 0 - \frac{R * T \cdot 0.1}{n * F} * (log_{10}\frac{4 × 10^(-6)}{10^(-9)})$

$E = -\frac{8.314 * 298.15 * 0.1}{2 * 96500} * (log_{10}4000)$

$E = -0.0107 * (3.602)$

$E \approx -0.0386$

The corrosion potential (E) is approximately -0.0386 V, rounded off to 2 decimal places. Therefore:

corrosion potential = [-0.0383]
