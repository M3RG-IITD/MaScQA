First, we need to calculate the amount of iron (in kg) needed to be produced per ton of hot metal. Since the composition of hot metal is 95.5% Fe and 4.5% C, we can assume that there is a total of 1000 kg of hot metal produced per ton, out of which 955 kg is Fe and 45 kg is C.

Next, we need to calculate the amount of $Fe_2O_3$ required to produce 955 kg of Fe. Since $Fe_2O_3$ is consumed in the process of making hot metal, we need to calculate the stoichiometric ratio of $Fe_2O_3$ to Fe to determine how much $Fe_2O_3$ is needed.

The balanced equation for the reaction of $Fe_2O_3$ with carbon in coke to produce Fe and CO is:

$Fe_2O_3 + 3C → 2Fe + 3CO$

From the equation, we can see that 2 moles of Fe are produced for every mole of $Fe_2O_3$ consumed. The molar mass of $Fe_2O_3$ is 160 g/mol (2x 56 + 3x 16) and the molar mass of Fe is 56 g/mol. Therefore, the ratio of the masses of Fe and $Fe_2O_3$ is:

$\frac{56 g/mol}{2 × 160 g/mol} = 0.175$

This means that for every 0.175 kg of $Fe_2O_3$ consumed, 1 kg of Fe is produced. To produce 955 kg of Fe, we therefore need to consume:

$\frac{955 kg}{0.175 kg/kg\ Fe_2O_3} = 5457.14 kg$ of $Fe_2O_3$

Since the hematite ore has a composition of 80% $Fe_2O_3$ and 20% gangue materials, we need to use:

$\frac{5457.14 kg}{0.8} = 6821.43 kg$

of hematite ore per ton of hot metal.

Next, we need to calculate the weight of coke needed. We are given that 600 kg of coke is used per ton of hot metal, and that the coke is 85% C and 15% ash. This means that the amount of carbon in 600 kg of coke is:

$0.85 × 600 kg = 510 kg$

Since C has a molar mass of 12 g/mol, 510 kg of C is equivalent to:

$\frac{510 kg}{12 kg/mol} = 42.5$ moles of C

From the balanced equation above, we know that for every mole of C consumed, 1/3 mole of $Fe_2O_3$ is consumed. Therefore, to consume 42.5 moles of C, we need to consume:

$42.5 \ × \frac{1}{3} mol \ = \ 14.17 \ mol$ of $Fe_2O_3$

The molar mass of $Fe_2O_3$ is 160 g/mol, so 14.17 moles of $Fe_2O_3$ is equivalent to:

$14.17 \ × \ 160 g/mol \ = \ 2267.2 \ kg$ of $Fe_2O_3$

However, we already calculated that we need 5457.14 kg of $Fe_2O_3$ to produce 955 kg of Fe. Therefore, we need to use:

$5457.14 kg - 2267.2 kg \ = \ 3190.94 kg$ of $Fe_2O_3$

from the hematite ore to supplement the $Fe_2O_3$ from the coke.

Finally, we need to calculate the weight of slag produced. We are given that the gangue materials in the hematite ore and the ash in the coke form slag. The hematite ore has a composition of 80% $Fe_2O_3$ and 20% gangue materials, so the weight of gangue materials in the ore is:

$\frac{0.2 × 6821.43 kg}{1} = 1364.29 kg$

The coke has a weight of 600 kg and a composition of 15% ash, so the weight of ash in the coke is:

$0.15 \ × \ 600 kg \ = \ 90 kg$

Therefore, the total weight of slag produced per ton of hot metal is:

$1364.29 kg + 90 kg \ = \ 1454.29 kg \ ≈ \ 1454 kg$

Answer: (C) 1705 kg, 331 kg.
