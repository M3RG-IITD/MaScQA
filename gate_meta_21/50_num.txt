Given: Diffusivity of B in liquid = $10^(-9)m^2s^(-1)$. Velocity of solidification front = 4 Âµm $s^(-1)$. A hypothetical binary eutectic phase diagram of A-B is shown below. An alloy with 5 wt.% B solidifies with no convection. Assumning steady state, the critical temperature gradient( in K $mm^(-1)$) required to maintain planar solidification front is?(round off to the nearest integer). Use the image.
