The magnetic moment of an individual atom is given by:

$\mu = \sqrt{n(n+2)}\mu_B$

where $n$ is the number of unpaired electrons and $\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton.

For iron, the atomic number is 26, and the electronic configuration is [Ar]3d$^6$4s$^2$. At room temperature, 5 out of the 6 3d electrons are unpaired, so $n=5$.

To find the magnetic moment per iron atom in the crystal, we need to divide the saturation magnetization by the number of iron atoms in a unit cell. The unit cell of iron is face-centered cubic, with 4 iron atoms per unit cell.

The lattice parameter is given as 0.287 nm. The unit cell volume can be calculated as follows:

$V_{cell} = a^3/4$

$V_{cell} = (0.287 \text{ nm})^3/4$

$V_{cell} = 0.0237 \text{ nm}^3$

The number density of iron atoms in the crystal can be calculated as follows:

$n = N/V_{cell}$

where $N$ is the Avogadro's number.

$n = 6.022 \times 10^{23} \text{ atoms/mol} / 0.0237 \text{ nm}^3$

$n = 2.535 \times 10^{28} \text{ atoms/m}^3$

Therefore, the magnetic moment per iron atom in the crystal is:

$\mu = \sqrt{n(n+2)}\mu_B$

$\mu = \sqrt{(2.535 \times 10^{28} \text{ atoms/m}^3) \times (2.535 \times 10^{28} \text{ atoms/m}^3 + 2)} \times 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \text{ J/T}$

$\mu = 2.221 \times 10^{-23} \text{ J/T}$

Using the definition of magnetic moment,

$\mu = IA$

where $I$ is the magnetization per unit volume and $A$ is the unit area.

Rearranging,

$I = \mu / A = \mu / (a^2/2)$

$I = (2.221 \times 10^{-23} \text{ J/T}) / [(0.287 \text{ nm})^2/2]$

$I = 1.518 \times 10^6 \text{ A/m}$

$I = 1.518 \times 10^{-2} \text{ kA/m}$

Finally, dividing by the saturation magnetization,

$x = I / M_s = 1.518 \times 10^{-2} \text{ kA/m} / 1700 \text{ kA/m}$

$x = 8.9 \times 10^{-6}$

Therefore, the magnetic moment per iron atom in the crystal is 8.9 * $10^(-23)$ $Am^(2)$ (rounded off to 1 decimal place).
