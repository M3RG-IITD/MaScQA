We can use the Orowan equation to solve this problem:

τ = Gbρ

where τ is the required shear stress, G is the shear modulus of the material, b is the magnitude of the Burgers vector of the dislocation, and ρ is the spacing between the precipitates.

We are given that τ = 100 MPa and ρ = 0.2 µm = 2x10^-4 μm. We need to find the new value of τ when ρ is increased to 0.5 µm = 5x10^-4 μm.

To solve for the shear modulus, we need to know the Poisson's ratio of the material. Let's assume a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, which is typical for metals.

The Burgers vector can be calculated from the interplanar spacing (d) of the crystal lattice and the Miller indices of the crystal planes containing the dislocation.

Since this information is not given in the problem statement, we will assume a value of b = 0.25 nm, which is typical for many metallic materials.

Now we can rearrange the Orowan equation to solve for G:

G = τ / (bρ)

Substituting the given values, we get:

G = (100 MPa) / (0.25 nm x 2x10^-4 μm) = 4x10^10 Pa

Now we can use the same equation to find the new value of τ:

τ' = Gbρ' = (4x10^10 Pa) x (0.25 nm) x (5x10^-4 μm) = 500 MPa

Rounding off to the nearest integer, the final answer is:
