(A) An oversized solute atom would preferentially migrate below the slip plane of an edge dislocation is a TRUE statement. 

(B) A spherically symmetric point defect can interact with both the hydrostatic and shear stress fields of a dislocation is a TRUE statement.

(C) A point defect can locally modify the elastic modulus and thereby can change the interaction energy is a TRUE statement.

(D) Vacancies are attracted towards the compressive region of dislocation is a FALSE statement. 

In fact, the vacancies are attracted towards the tensile region of dislocation, not the compressive region. This is because the tensile stress at the tip of the dislocation creates an energy minimum, which attracts vacancies. Additionally, the vacancies can reduce the local stress concentration around the dislocation and thereby reduce the overall energy of the system. 

Therefore, the answer is (D) Vacancies are attracted towards the compressive region of dislocation. 

Note: Understanding the interaction between point defects and dislocations is important in materials science as it affects the strength, ductility, and other mechanical properties of materials.
