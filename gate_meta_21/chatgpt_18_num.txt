The given stress tensor is:

```
| 80 -40   0 |
| -40  20   0 |
|   0   0 -20 |
```

The Tresca criterion states that yielding will occur when the difference between the maximum and minimum principal stresses in a body exceeds a certain value. For a material with yield strength `sigma_y`, this critical difference is `2*sigma_y`.

To find the principal stresses, we need to find the eigenvalues of the stress tensor. The characteristic equation is:

```
| 80-x   -40     0 |   | x²     0      0   |
| -40   20-x     0 | * |  0    x²      0   | = 0
|   0     0   -20-x|   |  0     0   (20+x) |
```

Expanding this gives:

```
x^3 - 80x^2 - 800x = 0
```

One solution is `x = 0`. Dividing the characteristic equation by `x` and applying the quadratic formula to the resulting equation gives the other two solutions:

```
x = 40 ± 4√70
```

The maximum and minimum principal stresses are therefore `40 + 4√70` and `-20`, respectively. The difference between these is:

```
40 + 4√70 - (-20) = 60 + 4√70
```

This means that the uniaxial tensile yield stress of the material should be less than or equal to:

```
(1/2) * (60 + 4√70) = 30 + 2√70 ≈ 39
```

Therefore, the answer is:

- 39
