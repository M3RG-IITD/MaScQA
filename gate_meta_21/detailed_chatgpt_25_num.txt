We can use the equation for the temperature dependence of vacancy concentration:

$$ \frac{C_v}{C_0} = e^{-Q_v/RT} $$

where $C_v$ is the vacancy concentration, $C_0$ is the concentration of lattice sites, $Q_v$ is the enthalpy of vacancy formation, $R$ is the gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.

We are told that the vacancy concentration doubles upon increasing the temperature from 27ºC to 127ºC. Let's call the initial vacancy concentration $C_{v0}$ and the final vacancy concentration $2C_{v0}$. We can set up two equations using the above formula:

$$ \frac{C_{v0}}{C_0} = e^{-Q_v/R(T_1 + 273.15)} $$

$$ \frac{2C_{v0}}{C_0} = e^{-Q_v/R(T_2 + 273.15)} $$

where $T_1$ is 27ºC and $T_2$ is 127ºC.

Dividing the second equation by the first, we get:

$$ \frac{2C_{v0}}{C_{v0}} = \frac{e^{-Q_v/R(T_2 + 273.15)}}{e^{-Q_v/R(T_1 + 273.15)}} $$

Simplifying:

$$ 2 = e^{Q_v/R(1/T_1 - 1/T_2)} $$

Plugging in the values for $R$, $T_1$, and $T_2$, we get:

$$ 2 = e^{Q_v/8.314(1/300 - 1/400)} $$

Solving for $Q_v$:

$$ Q_v = -R(1/T_1 - 1/T_2)\ln(2) = -(8.314)(1/300-1/400)\ln(2) = \boxed{0.66 \space kJ \mol^{-1}} $$

Therefore, the enthalpy of vacancy formation is 0.66 kJ $mol^{-1}$ (rounded to two decimal places).
