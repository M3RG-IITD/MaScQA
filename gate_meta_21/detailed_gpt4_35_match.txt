Let's match the terms in Column I with the unit processes in Column II.

(P) Submerged Entry Nozzle: This is a device used in continuous casting to control the flow of molten steel into the mold. So, P matches with 2 (Continuous Casting).

(Q) Electric Heating: This is a process of heating the metal through the use of electrical energy. Electric heating is commonly used in Ladle Furnace for refining and alloying purposes. So, Q matches with 1 (Ladle Furnace).

(R) Raceway Zone: This is a region inside the blast furnace where the solid burden materials (coke, ore and limestone) enter, and coke combustion occurs. So, R matches with 4 (Blast Furnace).

(S) Oxygen Lancing: This is a process in which a high-purity oxygen gas stream is directed through a lance onto the molten metal to remove impurities and reduce carbon content. Oxygen lancing is used in the LD (Linz-Donawitz) Convertor or Basic Oxygen Furnace. So, S matches with 3 (LD Convertor).

Therefore, the correct option is:

(A) P-2, Q-1, R-4, S-3
