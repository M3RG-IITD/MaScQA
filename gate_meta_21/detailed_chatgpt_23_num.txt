Polyethylene can be represented by the repeating unit -CH$_2$-, which has a molecular weight of 12 (for the carbon atom) + 2(1) = 14 g/mol. 

The degree of polymerization (DP) of a polymer is the number of repeating units in the polymer chain. Here, DP = 30000, meaning the polymer chain has 30000 repeating units of -CH$_2$-.

To calculate the average molecular weight of the polyethylene, we need to multiply the molecular weight of one repeating unit by the DP:

Average molecular weight = DP x molecular weight of repeating unit
= 30000 x 14 g/mol
= 420000 g/mol

Rounding off to the nearest integer, the average molecular weight of polyethylene is 420000 g/mol.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
- 420000 g/mol
