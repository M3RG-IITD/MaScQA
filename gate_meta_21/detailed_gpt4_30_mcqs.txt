Let's analyze each option:
(A) $\Delta H_{mix}^{(solid)}$ = 0 and $\Delta H_{mix}^{(liquid)}$ = 0
If the enthalpy of mixing in both solid and liquid phases is zero, it means that the interaction energies between different types of particles (A-A, B-B, and A-B) are the same. This implies an ideal behavior of the system, and there would be no driving force for phase separation. The phase diagram of this system would be characterized by a continuous solid and liquid phase with no distinction between A and B.

(B) $\Delta H_{mix}^{(solid)}$ << 0 and $\Delta H_{mix}^{(liquid)}$ = 0
Option B signifies that the enthalpy of mixing in the solid-state is strongly negative, which means that there is a strong attraction between A and B particles in the solid phase, leading to a tendency to form a well-mixed solid phase with no phase separation. On the other hand, the enthalpy of mixing in the liquid phase is zero, which implies that the system behaves ideally in the liquid phase, not favoring any phase separation. This option will lead to a complete mixing of A and B in both solid and liquid phases and would not produce a phase-separated binary phase diagram.

(C) $\Delta H_{mix}^{(solid)}$ > 0 and $\Delta H_{mix}^{(liquid)}$ = 0
In case C, the enthalpy of mixing in the solid phase is positive, meaning the interactions between A and B particles are weaker in the solid state as compared to A-A and B-B interactions. This leads to a tendency for phase separation in the solid phase. The enthalpy of mixing in the liquid phase is zero, which means the system behaves ideally in the liquid phase, and there is no additional driving force for phase separation. Therefore, this option will result in a binary phase diagram with phase separation in the solid phase.

(D) $\Delta H_{mix}^{(solid)}$ = 0 and $\Delta H_{mix}^{(liquid)}$ << 0
This option implies that the enthalpy of mixing in the solid phase is zero, meaning the system behaves ideally in the solid phase, and there is no additional driving force for phase separation. The enthalpy of mixing in the liquid phase is strongly negative, indicating a strong attraction between A and B particles in the liquid phase. As a result, there is a tendency to form a well-mixed liquid phase with no phase separation. This option will lead to a complete mixing of A and B in both solid and liquid phases and would not produce a phase-separated binary phase diagram.


After analyzing each option, only option C fits the condition for generating a binary phase diagram of A-B with phase separation.

So, the correct answer is:
[C]
