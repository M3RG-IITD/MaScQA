Given: $β_c$ = 0.1V per decade of current density. Exchange current density of hydrogen on iron surface = $10^(-9)$ A $cm^(-2)$, R = 8.314 J $mol^(-1)K^(-1)$, F = 96500 C $mol^(-1)$. All potentials are with reference to standard hydrogen electrode. At 25°C, iron corrodes in a dearated acid of pH 3 with a corrosion current density of 4 µA $cm^(-2)$. The corrosion potential (V) is?(round off to 2 decimal places).
