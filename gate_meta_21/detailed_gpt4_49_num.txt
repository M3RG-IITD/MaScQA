To find the maximum applied stress that the plate can sustain in mode I, we will use the following equation from the linear elastic fracture mechanics theory:

$$K_I = \sigma \sqrt{\pi a}$$

Where:
- $K_I$ is the stress intensity factor in mode I (units: MPa m^(1/2))
- $\sigma$ is the applied stress (units: MPa)
- $a$ is the crack length (in meters)

Given the fracture toughness $K_{1c}$ = 20 MPa m^(1/2), this is the maximum value of $K_I$ the material can sustain before it propagates the crack. We are given a central through-thickness crack of length 80/Ï€ mm, so we can write that as:

$$a = \frac{80}{\pi}\text{mm} = \frac{80}{\pi}\times10^{-3} \text{m}$$

Now we will use the fracture toughness equation (substituting $K_I$ with $K_{1c}$ since it is the maximum stress intensity factor) to find the maximum applied stress:

$$K_{1c} = \sigma \sqrt{\pi a}$$

Solve for $\sigma$:

$$\sigma = \frac{K_{1c}}{\sqrt{\pi a}}$$

Plugging in the values:

$$\sigma = \frac{20\,\text{MPa m}^{1/2}}{\sqrt{\pi \times \frac{80}{\pi}\times10^{-3} \text{m}}}$$

Simplifying:

$$\sigma = \frac{20\,\text{MPa m}^{1/2}}{\sqrt{80\times10^{-3}\text{m}}}$$

Now, compute the value of $\sigma$:

$$\sigma \approx 2.236\,\text{MPa}$$

Since we want the answer rounded off to the nearest integer, the maximum applied stress that the plate can sustain in mode I is:

$$\left[ 2\,\text{MPa} \right]$$
