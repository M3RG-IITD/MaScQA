To find the average molecular weight of polyethylene with a degree of polymerization of 30,000, we will follow these steps:

1. Write the molecular formula of polyethylene
2. Find the molecular weight of a single monomer unit from the atomic weights
3. Multiply the molecular weight of a single monomer unit by the degree of polymerization to find the average molecular weight

Step 1: The molecular formula of polyethylene is (C2H4)n, where n is the degree of polymerization.

Step 2: Calculate the molecular weight of a single monomer unit
- We know that the atomic weights of carbon and hydrogen are 12 and 1, respectively.
- Therefore, the molecular weight of C2H4 is: (2 * 12) + (4 * 1) = 24 + 4 = 28 g/mol

Step 3: Multiply the molecular weight of a single monomer unit by the degree of polymerization
- We are given that the degree of polymerization is 30,000
- So, the average molecular weight of polyethylene is: 28 g/mol * 30,000 = 840,000 g/mol

Rounding off the average molecular weight to the nearest integer, we get:

Average Molecular Weight = 840,000 g/mol

Answer: [840000]
