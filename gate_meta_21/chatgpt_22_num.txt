The steel is hypoeutectoid since its carbon content is less than the eutectoid composition of 0.8 wt.%C. Upon slow cooling, the steel will follow the following transformation sequence:

Austenite → Proeutectoid Ferrite + Austenite → Pearlite

Since the maximum solubility of carbon in α-Fe is 0.025 wt.% C, any excess carbon beyond this limit will precipitate out as cementite (Fe3C) to form the lamellar structure of pearlite.

Amount of proeutectoid ferrite = (0.8-0.6)/(0.8-0.025) = 0.59

Fraction of proeutectoid ferrite = 0.59/(1+0.59) = 0.37 or 37%

Answer: [0.37 or 37%]
