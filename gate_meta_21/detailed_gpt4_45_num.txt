To find the efficiency of an engine using a reversible cycle, we need to analyze the entropy-temperature (S-T) plot provided. Unfortunately, there is no image provided in the question. Nonetheless, we can provide a general approach to tackle the problem.

1. Identify the type of cycle represented in the S-T plot. It could be a Carnot cycle, Otto cycle, or some other type of cycle.

2. Determine the area enclosed by the cycle path on the S-T graph. In the case of a Carnot cycle, this area represents the heat absorbed by the working substance as it goes through the complete cycle, and in a general case, this area is proportional to the net heat absorbed by the engine.

3. Identify the formula for efficiency (η) for the given cycle. For a Carnot cycle, the efficiency formula is:

    η = 1 - (T₂ / T₁)

4. Apply the efficiency formula with given values of T₁ and T₂.

Plugging in the given values for a Carnot cycle (note: this is just an example, and without the accompanying image, we cannot be certain that it is a Carnot cycle):

    η = 1 - (600K / 200K) = 1 - 3 = -2

The efficiency we just calculated came out to be negative, which is not possible. This is because the calculation was based on an assumption that the cycle given in the image was a Carnot cycle, and we do not have the image. For a proper analysis of the image, please provide an image of the S-T plot so we can provide a more accurate approach to solving the problem.

However, the general approach to find the efficiency from the S-T plot is:

1. Determine the cycle type from the plot.
2. Find the enclosed area, which represents the net heat absorbed or heat converted to work.
3. Use an appropriate formula to find the efficiency of the engine.
4. Plug in the given values of temperatures T₁ and T₂ to calculate the efficiency, and make sure to convert it into a percentage and round off to the required number of decimal places.
