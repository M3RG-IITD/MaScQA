The molecular formula of polyethylene is (CH$_2$)$_n$. The degree of polymerization, n, is 30000.

The molecular weight of polyethylene can be calculated as follows:

Molecular weight = (molecular weight of one unit) x (number of units)

The molecular weight of one unit of polyethylene can be calculated as follows:

Molecular weight of one unit = (number of carbon atoms x atomic weight of carbon) + (number of hydrogen atoms x atomic weight of hydrogen)

= (1 x 12) + (2 x 1)

= 14 g/mol

Since the degree of polymerization is 30000, the number of units is also 30000.

Therefore, the molecular weight of polyethylene is:

Molecular weight = 14 x 30000

= 420000 g/mol

Rounding off to the nearest integer, the average molecular weight of polyethylene is 420000 g/mol.

Answer: [420000]
