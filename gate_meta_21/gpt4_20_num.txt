We know that the saturation magnetization (Ms) is related to the magnetic moment per atom (μ) by the following formula:

Ms = μ * N / V,

where N is the number of atoms per unit cell and V is the volume of the unit cell.

For a body-centered cubic (bcc) structure like iron, there are 2 atoms per unit cell. The lattice parameter (a) is given to be 0.287 nm, which is equal to 0.287 * 10^(-9) m. Therefore, the unit cell volume, V = a^3 = (0.287 * 10^(-9))^3 m^3.

Now, we can rearrange the formula for magnetic moment:

μ = Ms * V / N.

Substituting the given values,

μ = (1700 $kAm^(-1)$) * (0.287 * 10^(-9))^3 m^3 / 2.

μ = (1700 * 10^3 $Am^(-1)$) * (2.364 * 10^(-29)) $m^3$ / 2.

μ = 1.7 * 10^6 * 2.364 * 10^(-23) $Am^2$.

μ ≈ 4.02 * 10^(-23) $Am^2$.

Therefore, the magnetic moment per iron atom in the crystal is approximately 4.0 * 10^(-23) $Am^2$. So, the value of x is 4.0. The final answer is:

[4.0]
