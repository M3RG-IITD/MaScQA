True strain (ε) is a measure of the amount of deformation experienced by a material during a forming process. In the case of hot forging with a height reduction, we can calculate the true strain using the natural logarithm of the ratio between the original height (H0) and the final height (Hf).

For a 60% height reduction, we can calculate the true strain as follows:

Step 1: Determine the original height (H0) and final height (Hf).
Since we don't have specific height values, we can use a percentage reduction to relate H0 and Hf. In this problem, the height reduction is 60%, so Hf = 0.4 * H0.

Step 2: Calculate the true strain (ε).
ε = ln(H0 / Hf)

Substitute Hf = 0.4 * H0:
ε = ln(H0 / (0.4 * H0))

Step 3: Simplify the expression.
ε = ln(1 / 0.4)

Step 4: Calculate the true strain (ε).
ε ≈ 1.204

Step 5: Round off the answer to 2 decimal places.
ε ≈ 1.20

So, the true strain for a 60% height reduction subjected to hot forging is approximately 1.20. The answer is [1.20].
