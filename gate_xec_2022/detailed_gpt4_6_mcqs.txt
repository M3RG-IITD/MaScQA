To determine which solvent environment will likely result in swelling of solid polystyrene, we need to analyze the interactions between the polymer and solvent molecules. Polystyrene is a long-chain hydrocarbon polymer, thus it consists of non-polar molecules. Non-polar materials are generally soluble in non-polar solvents and insoluble in polar solvents.

Now, let's analyze the solvents one by one.

(A) 0.1 M NaOH in $H_2O$: This is an aqueous solution of a strong base (NaOH). Water is a polar solvent, and NaOH will make the solution highly polar since it dissociates into ions. Since polystyrene is non-polar, it won't be soluble in this polar environment, so it won't cause swelling.

(B) HCl (aq.) of pH = 6: This is also an aqueous solution but weakly acidic due to the presence of HCl. Again, the presence of water makes the solvent polar. A non-polar polymer like polystyrene will be insoluble in this polar solvent, so it won't cause swelling.

(C) Distilled water: Distilled water is pure water, without any impurities or ions, so it's a polar solvent. As discussed earlier, polystyrene is non-polar and won't be soluble in a polar environment like water, so it won't cause swelling.

(D) Benzene: Benzene is a non-polar solvent. It consists of a carbon ring with alternating double bonds, making it a good solvent for non-polar solutes. As polystyrene is also non-polar, it will likely be soluble in benzene, causing the polymer to swell.

In conclusion, the correct solvent environment that will likely result in swelling of solid polystyrene is:
