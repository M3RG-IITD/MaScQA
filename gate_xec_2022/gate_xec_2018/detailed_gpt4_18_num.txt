To solve this problem, we need to understand the behavior of the particles inside the infinite potential well and how their energies are related to the number of particles.

First, let's review some key concepts related to infinite potential wells and particle energy levels. In an infinite potential well, a particle can only have discrete energy levels given by the following formula:

E_n = (n^2 * h^2) / (8 * m * L^2)

where E_n is the energy of the particle in the n-th energy level, h is the Planck's constant, m is the mass of the particle, and L is the width of the potential well.

Now, let's examine the ground state energy of 3 identical non-interacting spin ½ particles. Since the particles are non-interacting, we can treat them independently. Recall that for spin ½ particles, they can have two possible spin states, so each energy level can accommodate two particles.

For 3 particles in the ground state, the energy levels they occupy are:

- 1st particle: n = 1 (the lowest energy level)
- 2nd particle: n = 1 (still the lowest energy level but with a different spin)
- 3rd particle: n = 2 (the next available energy level)

As the ground state energy for 3 particles is 18 meV, we can express this energy as the sum of the individual particle energies:

18 meV = E_1 + E_1 + E_2

Next, let's find the new ground state energy when there are 7 identical non-interacting spin ½ particles inside the well. The energy levels for these particles are:

- 1st particle: n = 1
- 2nd particle: n = 1
- 3rd particle: n = 2
- 4th particle: n = 2
- 5th particle: n = 3
- 6th particle: n = 3
- 7th particle: n = 4

We need to find the new ground state energy, which can be expressed as:

E_new = E_1 + E_1 + E_2 + E_2 + E_3 + E_3 + E_4

Notice that the first six energy terms are the same as the previous case. So we can substitute the known ground state energy for the first six terms:

E_new = 18 meV + E_4

Now we need to find the energy of the 4th level (E_4) in terms of the other energy levels. By looking at the original energy formula, we can see that the energy is proportional to the square of the energy level:

E_n = K * n^2  (where K is a constant)

From the energy levels of the 3-particle case, we can write two equations:

E_1 = K * (1^2) = K
E_2 = K * (2^2) = 4K

Now we can find the energy for the 4th level:

E_4 = K * (4^2) = 16K

Going back to the equation for the new ground state energy:

E_new = 18 meV + E_4 = 18 meV + 16K

We already know E_2 = 4K, and the 18 meV ground state energy can be written as:

18 meV = 2E_1 + E_2 = 2K + 4K = 6K

Solving for K, we get:

K = 3 meV

So, the energy of the 4th level is:

E_4 = 16K = 16 * 3 meV = 48 meV

Finally, the new ground state energy is:

E_new = 18 meV + 48 meV = 66 meV

Thus, the new ground state energy for 7 identical non-interacting spin ½ particles inside the infinite potential well is 66 meV. 

The correct answer is [66].
