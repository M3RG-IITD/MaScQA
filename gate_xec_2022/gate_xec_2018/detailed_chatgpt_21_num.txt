To find the planar atomic density in the (110) plane, we need to first determine the spacing between (110) planes in an iron crystal.

Assuming that the (110) planes are parallel to each other, the spacing d between adjacent (110) planes can be determined using the following formula:

$d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2}}$

where a is the lattice parameter and hkl are the Miller indices of the crystal plane of interest. For the (110) plane in iron, h = 1, k = 1 and l = 0, so we have:

$d = \frac{0.287}{\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 0^2}} = 0.161 nm$

Now, the planar atomic density N (i.e. the number of atoms per unit area) in the (110) plane can be determined using the following formula:

$N = \frac{1}{d^2}$

Substituting d = 0.161 nm, we get:

$N = \frac{1}{0.161^2} = 38.2 nm^{-2}$

Therefore, the planar atomic density in the (110) plane of a BCC iron crystal is 38.2 $nm^{-2}$ (rounded up to 2 decimal places).
