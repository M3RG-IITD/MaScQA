The energy of a photon can be calculated using the formula:

$E = hc/\lambda$

where h is Planck’s constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength of the photon.

Using the given wavelength of 500 nm:

$E = (6.6 \times 10^{-34} J\cdot s)(3 \times 10^8 m/s)/(500 \times 10^{-9} m)$

$E = 3.96 \times 10^{-19} J$

This is the energy released by a single atom undergoing a transition from the higher to the lower energy level.

There are 3 * $10^(20)$ atoms in the system, but the population inversion (where there are more atoms in the higher energy level than the lower energy level) is only 7/11 of the total population. This means that 2/11 of the atoms will undergo a transition from the higher to the lower energy level, releasing a photon each. The total energy released in one pulse can be calculated as:

Total energy = (energy per photon) × (number of photons)

Total energy = (3.96 × 10⁻¹⁹ J) × (2/11) × (4 × 10²⁰)

Total energy = 3.41 × 10⁻¹² J

Rounding to 2 decimal places, the final answer is:

0.00 000 000 003 4 J

Answer: [0.00 000 000 003 4 J]
