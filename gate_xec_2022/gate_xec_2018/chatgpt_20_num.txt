The Bragg's law for X-ray diffraction is given by: 

nλ = 2d sinθ

where n is an integer representing the order of reflection, λ is the wavelength of x-ray, d is the interplanar spacing and θ is the angle of incidence. 

For the FCC crystal structure, the Miller Indices for the (hkl) planes are given by (hkl) = (100), (110), (111), (200), (210), (211), (220), (221), (222), ...  

The interplanar spacing d for the (hkl) planes in FCC crystal lattice is given by:

d = a / sqrt(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)

where a is the lattice parameter and h, k and l are the Miller indices. 

For (100) plane, 

d = a / sqrt(1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2) = a/1 = a

For (110) plane, 

d = a / sqrt(1^2 + 1^2 + 0^2) = a / sqrt(2)

For (111) plane, 

d = a / sqrt(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) = a / sqrt(3)

For (200) plane, 

d = a / sqrt(2^2 + 0^2 + 0^2) = a/ 2

For (210) plane, 

d = a / sqrt(2^2 + 1^2 + 0^2) = a / (2√2)

For (211) plane, 

d = a / sqrt(2^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) = a / {2 [ (1/2)^2 + 1 ]^1/2 } = a / (3√2)

For (220) plane, 

d = a / sqrt(2^2 + 2^2 + 0^2) = a / (2√2)

For (221) plane, 

d = a / sqrt(2^2 + 2^2 + 1^2) = a / {3 [  (1/2)^2 + 1 ]^1/2 } = a / (4√2)

For (222) plane, 

d = a / sqrt(2^2 + 2^2 + 2^2) = a / 2√3

To find the angles of diffraction, we need to rearrange the Bragg's law as:

θ = sin^-1 (nλ / 2d)

For n = 1, 

θ100 = sin^-1 (λ/2a)

θ110 = sin^-1 (λ / 2√2 a)

θ111 = sin^-1 (λ / 2√3 a)

θ200 = sin^-1 (λ / 4a)

θ210 = sin^-1 (λ / 4√2 a)

θ211 = sin^-1 (λ / 6√2 a)

θ220 = sin^-1 (λ / 4√2 a)

θ221 = sin^-1 (λ / 8√2 a)

θ222 = sin^-1 (λ / 6a)

Substituting the given values, we get:

θ100 = sin^-1 (0.229 / (2 × 0.405)) = 20.46°

θ110 = sin^-1 (0.229 / (2 × 0.286)) = 30.38°

θ111 = sin^-1 (0.229 / (2 × 0.249)) = 34.52°

θ200 = sin^-1 (0.229 / (4 × 0.405)) = 44.90°

θ210 = sin^-1 (0.229 / (4 × 0.286)) = 58.02°

θ211 = sin^-1 (0.229 / (6 × 0.286)) = 70.46°

θ220 = sin^-1 (0.229 / (4 × 0.286)) = 78.48°

θ221 = sin^-1 (0.229 / (8 × 0.286)) = 89.25°

θ222 = sin^-1 (0.229 / (6 × 0.405)) = 103.13°

The maximum number of peaks that can be observed in the pattern is equal to the number of unique angles (up to a certain tolerance), since each angle corresponds to a unique set of (hkl) planes. 

Therefore, the maximum number of peaks that can be observed in the pattern is
