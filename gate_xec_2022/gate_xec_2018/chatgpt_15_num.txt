The buoyancy force on an object immersed in a fluid is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. Using this, we can calculate the volume of the sample:
 
Buoyancy Force = Weight of Sample in air - Weight of Sample in water

Buoyancy Force = 2.67 g - 1.67 g = 1.00 g

Volume of Sample = Buoyancy Force / Density of Water

Volume of Sample = 1.00 g / 1.00 g $cm^(-3)$ = 1.00 $cm^3$

Now, we can calculate the density of the sample:

Density of Sample = Mass of Sample / Volume of Sample

Density of Sample = 2.67 g / 1.00 $cm^3$ = 2.67 g $cm^(-3)$

Therefore, the density of the sample is 2.67 g $cm^(-3)$. Answer: [2.67]
