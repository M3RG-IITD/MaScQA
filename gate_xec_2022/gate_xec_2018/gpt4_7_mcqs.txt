Let's consider the possible ways the atom can make 4 jumps and return to the starting point.

1. LRLL (Left, Right, Left, Left)
2. LRLR (Left, Right, Left, Right)
3. LLRR (Left, Left, Right, Right)
4. RLLR (Right, Left, Left, Right)
5. RLRL (Right, Left, Right, Left)
6. RRLR (Right, Right, Left, Right)

So, there are 6 possible ways the atom can return to the starting point after 4 jumps.

Each move has a probability of 0.5 (since a jump to the left or right is equally probable), and there are 4 such moves.

Therefore, the probability of returning to the starting point in each of these 6 cases is (0.5)^4 = 0.0625.

Since these 6 cases are mutually exclusive, the probability of returning to the starting point after 4 jumps is 6 * 0.0625 = 0.375.

The correct answer is (C) 0.375.
