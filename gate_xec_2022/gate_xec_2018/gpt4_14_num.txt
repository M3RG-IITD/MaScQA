To find the Young's modulus of the composite (Ec), we can use the rule of mixtures for aligned fibers.

Ec = E_f * V_f + E_m * V_m

Where:
Ec = Young's modulus of the composite
E_f = Young's modulus of the fiber (200 GPa)
E_m = Young's modulus of the matrix (10 GPa)
V_f = volume fraction of the fiber (0.6)
V_m = volume fraction of the matrix (1 - V_f)

First, let's calculate the volume fraction of the matrix, V_m:

V_m = 1 - V_f = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4

Now, we can calculate the Young's modulus of the composite:

Ec = (200 GPa * 0.6) + (10 GPa * 0.4) = 120 GPa + 4 GPa = 124 GPa

Thus, the Young's modulus of the composite is 124 GPa.

Answer: [124]
