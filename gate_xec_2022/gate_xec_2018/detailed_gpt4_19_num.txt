Unfortunately, there is no figure provided with the problem. However, I'll assume the following scenario: We have a function, f(x), and the definite integral of f(x) from a to b is represented by I. And we're given I = 4.

Please note that without the actual figure or the specific function f(x), I cannot provide an accurate answer for the constant b. We also need the limits of integration, i.e., the values of a and b, to find the answer you requested. In case you meant b to be the constant in the equation, please provide the function so I can help you find the constant value b.

Just for the sake of example, let's consider the following function:

f(x) = bx

We want to find b such that the integral of f(x) from 0 to 1 is 4. 

Step 1: Write down the given information:

I = 4, a = 0, and b = 1

Step 2: Set up the integral equation:

I = ∫[f(x)dx] = ∫[bx dx] from x = 0 to x = 1

Step 3: Evaluate the integral:

I = [b*(1/2)x^2] from x = 0 to x = 1

Since a = 0, subtracting the lower limit value will result in 0 .

So,

I = [b*(1/2)(1)^2] = (b/2)

Step 4: Solve for b:

4 = (b/2)

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:

8 = b

In this example, the constant b is 8.

Please provide the specifics of your problem so I can provide an accurate answer for your particular case. However, the process demonstrated above can be applied to any function and any interval [a, b] to find the desired constant value.
