An atom is restricted to move in one dimension by making unit jumps either to the left or right, as shown in the figure. Assuming that a jump to the left or right is equally probable, the probability of the atom returning back to the starting point after four jumps is
(A) 0.250 (B) 0.333 (C) 0.375 (D) 0.500
