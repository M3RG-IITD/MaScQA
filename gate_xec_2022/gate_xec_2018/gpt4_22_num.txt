To solve this question, we will be using the temperature dependence equation of the diffusion coefficient from Fick's law, which is given by the Arrhenius equation:

$D = D_0 e^{(-Q / RT)}$

Where:
$D$ is the diffusion coefficient,
$D_0$ is the pre-exponential (constant) factor,
$Q$ is the activation energy,
$R$ is the gas constant,
$T$ is the absolute temperature.

We are given that the case depth is doubled when the temperature is increased. The case depth is directly proportional to the square root of the diffusion coefficient, so we can write:

$\sqrt{D_2} = 2\sqrt{D_1}$

Squaring both sides, we get:

$D_2 = 4D_1$

Now, using the Arrhenius equation for both cases, we can write:

$D_1 = D_0 e^{(-Q / RT_1)}$

$D_2 = D_0 e^{(-Q / RT_2)}$

Now, substituting $D_2 = 4D_1$:

$D_0 e^{(-Q / RT_2)} = 4D_0 e^{(-Q / RT_1)}$

Since $D_0$ is the same constant factor for both cases, we can divide both sides by it:

$e^{(-Q / RT_2)} = 4 e^{(-Q / RT_1)}$

Next, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides:

$(-Q / RT_2) = ln(4) + (-Q / RT_1)$

Reorganizing terms, we get:

$Q(1 / RT_1 - 1 / RT_2) = ln(4)R$

Given the values of Q, R and $T_1$, we can solve for $T_2$:

$T_2 = \dfrac{1}{(\dfrac{1}{T_1} - \dfrac{ln(4)R}{Q})}$

Substituting the values:

$T_2 = \dfrac{1}{(\dfrac{1}{1300} - \dfrac{ln(4)(8.314)}{148000})}$

Solving for $T_2$:

$T_2 â‰ˆ 1370 K$

Therefore, the case depth can be doubled by increasing the temperature to approximately 1370 K. The answer is:
