We know that for a particle with spin ½, it can take two possible orientations: up (+½) and down (-½). In an infinite potential well, the energy levels depend on the principal quantum number n (denoting the energy level), the size of the well, the mass of the particle, and the value of the Planck constant.

Let's first analyze the case with three particles. To minimize the energy, we want to place the particles in the lowest energy states possible. For three particles, we can arrange them as follows:

1. Particle 1: n=1 state with spin up (+½)
2. Particle 2: n=1 state with spin down (-½)
3. Particle 3: n=2 state with spin up (+½)

Now, we know that the energy levels in an infinite potential well are proportional to n², which means the energies for the particles will be E1 = k and E2 = 4k. The ground state energy of the system is the sum of these energies:

18 meV = E1 (particle 1) + E1 (particle 2) + E2 (particle 3)
18 meV = k + k + 4k
18 meV = 6k
k = 3 meV

Now, let's analyze the case with seven particles. We can arrange them in the following way:

1. Particle 1: n=1 state with spin up (+½)
2. Particle 2: n=1 state with spin down (-½)
3. Particle 3: n=2 state with spin up (+½)
4. Particle 4: n=2 state with spin down (-½)
5. Particle 5: n=3 state with spin up (+½)
6. Particle 6: n=3 state with spin down (-½)
7. Particle 7: n=4 state with spin up (+½)

Now, we can calculate the new ground state energy:

E_new = E1 (particle 1) + E1 (particle 2) + E2 (particle 3) + E2 (particle 4) + E3 (particle 5) + E3 (particle 6) + E4 (particle 7)
E_new = k + k + 4k + 4k + 9k + 9k + 16k
E_new = 44k

Since we already found that k = 3 meV, the new ground state energy can be calculated as:

E_new = 44k = 44 * 3 meV = 132 meV

So, the new ground state energy for seven particles is 132 meV. The answer is:
