In a fatigue test, completely reversed cyclic loading refers to a loading condition where the specimen is subjected to a repeating, periodic stress cycle that passes through zero stress. This means that the stress alternates between equal tensile stress and equal compressive stress throughout the cycle.

The stress ratio (R) is defined as the ratio of the minimum stress (σ_min) to the maximum stress (σ_max) in a stress cycle.

For completely reversed cyclic loading, the minimum stress (σ_min) is equal to the negative of the maximum stress (σ_max), i.e., σ_min = -σ_max.

Therefore, the stress ratio (R) can be calculated as:

R = σ_min / σ_max
R = (-σ_max) / σ_max
R = -1

So the correct answer is (C) -1.

Answer: [-1]
