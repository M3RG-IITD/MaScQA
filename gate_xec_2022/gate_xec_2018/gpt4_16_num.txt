First, we need to compute the energy of a single photon:

E = (h * c) / λ

where E is the energy, h is the Planck's constant (6.6 * $10^(-34)$ J s), c is the speed of light (3 * $10^8$ m/s), and λ is the wavelength (500 nm = 500 * $10^(-9)$ m).

E = (6.6 * $10^(-34)$ * 3 * $10^8$) / (500 * $10^(-9)$)
E ≈ 3.96 * $10^{-19}$ J

Next, we need to find out how many atoms can release energy in a pulse, which is the difference between the number of atoms in the upper and lower levels.

Number of atoms = 7 * $10^{20}$ - 4 * $10^{20}$
Number of atoms = 3 * $10^{20}$

Finally, we can calculate the total energy released in a single pulse:

Total energy = Number of atoms * Energy per photon
Total energy = 3 * $10^{20}$ * 3.96 * $10^{-19}$
Total energy ≈ 1.19 * $10^2$ J

So, the amount of energy released in a single pulse is approximately 119 J.
