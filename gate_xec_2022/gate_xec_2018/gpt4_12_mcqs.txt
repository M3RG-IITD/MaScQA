Using Ohm's Law, we need to find the current (I) passing through the semiconductor cube. We are given the following parameters:

Conduction electron concentration (n) = $10^{12}$ $cm^{-3}$
Mobility of electrons and holes (μ) = 4 * $10^4$ $cm^2$ $V^{-1}$ $s^{-1}$
Voltage applied (V) = 100 V
Edge length of the cube (L) = 1 cm
Charge of electron (q) = 1.6 * $10^{-19}$ C

We can find the conductivity (σ) of the semiconductor using the given properties: 
σ = q * n * μ

Substitute the known values in the above equation:
σ = 1.6 * $10^{-19}$ C * $10^{12}$ $cm^{-3}$ * 4 * $10^4$ $cm^2$ $V^{-1}$ $s^{-1}$

σ = 6.4 * $10^{-3}$ $S/cm$

Now we can use Ohm's Law to find the current passing through the cube:

I = V / R

Where R is the resistance of the semiconductor. The resistance can be related to the conductivity using the relation R = L / (σ * A), where A is the cross-sectional area of the cube.

Since the edge length of the cube is 1 cm, the cross-sectional area will be:
A = 1 $cm^2$

Substitute and find the resistance:

R = 1 / (6.4 * $10^{-3}$ $S/cm$ * 1 $cm^2$)

R = 1 / 6.4 * $10^{-3}$ $S$

R = 156.25 Ohm

Now substitute the resistance in Ohm's Law:

I = 100 V / 156.25 Ohm

I = 0.64 A

To convert the current in mA, multiply by 1000:

I = 0.64 * 1000 mA

I = 640 mA

So the current through the cube would be 640 mA. Thus, the correct answer is:

[A] 640.
