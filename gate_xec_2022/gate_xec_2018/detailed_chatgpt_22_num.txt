The formula for calculating the increase in temperature required to double the depth of penetration is as follows:

$$
\frac{Q}{R} \ln \left(\frac{t_2}{t_1}\right) + T_{1} = T_{2}
$$

Where,

Q = Activation energy = 148 kJ $mol^(-1)$

R = Gas constant = 8.314 J $mol^(-1)$ $K^(-1)$

$t_1$ = initial time = 1 hour

$t_2$ = new time = 2 hours (since we want to double the case depth while keeping the time as 1 hour)

$T_1$ = initial temperature = 1300 K

$T_2$ = new temperature (to be calculated)

Substituting the values in the formula:

$$
\frac{(148 \times 10^3 \text{ J mol}^{-1})}{(8.314 \text{ J mol}^{-1} K^{-1})} \ln \left(\frac{2}{1}\right) + (1300 \text{ K}) = T_{2}
$$

Solving the above equation:

$$
T_{2} = 1427 \text{ K}
$$

Therefore, rounding off to the nearest whole number, the temperature required to double the case depth is 1427 K.

Answer: 

- 1427 K
