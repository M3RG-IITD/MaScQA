We are given that the specific heat of a two-dimensional solid varies with temperature as:

𝐶𝑝 = $𝑏𝑇^𝑛$

Here, b is a constant and T is the temperature in Kelvin (K).

To find the value of n, we can take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides of the equation:

ln(𝐶𝑝) = ln($𝑏𝑇^𝑛$)

Using the laws of logarithms, we can simplify this as:

ln(𝐶𝑝) = ln(b) + n*ln(T)

This is now in the form of a linear equation, where ln(Cp) is the dependent variable and ln(T) is the independent variable. We can write this as:

y = mx + c

where y = ln(𝐶𝑝), x = ln(T), m = n (the slope of the line), and c = ln(b) (the y-intercept of the line).

To find the value of n, we need to determine the slope of the line. One way to do this is to plot ln(Cp) as a function of ln(T) and fit a straight line to the data points. The slope of the line will give us the value of n.

Alternatively, we can differentiate both sides of the original equation with respect to T:

d𝐶𝑝/dT = nbT^(n-1)

This gives us the rate of change of specific heat with temperature. At low temperatures, the specific heat varies slowly with temperature, so n-1 is close to zero. Therefore, we have:

d𝐶𝑝/dT ≈ nb

The left-hand side is the definition of heat capacity at constant pressure, which is a measure of the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of the system by one degree. At low temperatures, the heat capacity is proportional to the temperature, so we have:

Cp ≈ d𝐶𝑝/dT ≈ nbT^0 = nb

Comparing this with the original equation, we see that n must be equal to 0. Therefore, the value of n is:

n = 0
