The correct matches for the invariant reactions are:
- (P) L ⇄ α + β: This is a eutectic reaction, so it matches with (5).
- (Q) L + α ⇄ β: This is a peritectic reaction, so it matches with (3).
- (R) γ ⇄ α + β: This is a eutectoid reaction, so it matches with (4).
- (S) α + β ⇄ γ: This is a peritectoid reaction, so it matches with (2).

So, the correct answer is (B) P-5, Q-3, R-4, S-2.
