The coordination number in an ionic crystal structure depends on the ratio of the cation (C) to anion (A) radius, which is defined as $r_C/r_A$. In general, the following rules are used to determine the coordination number:

- If the ratio is between 0.225 and 0.414, the coordination number is 4 (tetrahedral).
- If the ratio is between 0.414 and 0.732, the coordination number is 6 (octahedral).
- If the ratio is between 0.732 and 1, the coordination number is 8 (cubic).

Given that the $r_C/r_A$ ratio is 0.6, we can see it falls in the second category, between 0.414 and 0.732. Therefore, the coordination number of the C ion is likely to be 6.

The correct answer is [6].
