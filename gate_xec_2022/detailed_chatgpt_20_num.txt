We know that resistivity ($\rho$) of a semiconductor is given by:

$\rho = \frac{1}{q(n_e\mu_e + n_h\mu_h)}$

where $q$ is the absolute charge of an electron, $n_e$ and $n_h$ are the electron and hole concentrations respectively, and $\mu_e$ and $\mu_h$ are the mobilities of electrons and holes respectively.

Since the semiconductor is pure, the electron and hole concentrations are equal, i.e. $n_e = n_h = n$.

Substituting the given values, we get:

$3000 = \frac{1}{1.6*10^{-19}}\frac{n}{0.14n + 0.06n}$

Simplifying, we get:

$3000 = \frac{1}{1.6*10^{-19}}\times \frac{n}{0.2n}$

$3000 = 3.125*10^{19}$

$n = 1.04*10^{23}$

Substituting this value of $n$ in the relation $n_e = N_A*exp(-E_g/k_B T)$, we get:

$1.04*10^{23} = 6.02*10^{23}*exp(-E_g/(8.62*10^{-5}T))$

Simplifying, we get:

$exp(E_g/(8.62*10^{-5}T)) = 6.02/1.04$

$E_g/(8.62*10^{-5}T) = ln(6.02/1.04)$

$E_g = -8.62*10^{-5}T\ln(6.02/1.04)$

$E_g = -0.612T\ln(6.02/1.04)$ (in eV)

Rounding off to two decimal places, we get:

$E_g = \boxed{1.34}$ eV.
