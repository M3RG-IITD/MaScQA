To solve this problem, we need to use the Gibbs-Thomson equation for the Gibbs free energy change and the Young's equation for the interfacial energies. 

1. The Gibbs-Thomson equation for homogeneous nucleation is given by:

∆$G_(hom)$ = $\frac{4πr_c^2γ_{αβ}}{3}$

where $r_c$ is the critical radius and $γ_{αβ}$ is the α-β interfacial energy. 

2. For heterogeneous nucleation, the Gibbs-Thomson equation becomes:

∆$G_(het)$ = $\frac{4πr_c^2γ_{αβ}\Phi}{3}$

where Φ is the wetting factor, which is a dimensionless parameter ranging from 0 to 1, representing the degree to which the particle wets the substrate. 

3. Now, we need to use the Young's equation to relate the interfacial energies and the contact angle θ:

$γ_{αδ}$ = $γ_{αβ}\cos(θ) + γ_{βδ}$

We are given that the α-β interfacial energy $γ_{αβ} = 0.4 J/m^2$, the α-δ interfacial energy $γ_{αδ} = 0.3 J/m^2$, and the β-δ interfacial energy $γ_{βδ} = 0.02 J/m^2$. Substitute these values into the Young's equation:

$0.3$ = $0.4\cos(θ) + 0.02$

Now, we calculate the value of θ:

$0.4\cos(θ) = 0.3 - 0.02$

$\cos(θ) = 0.28 /  :+:0.4=$

$θ = \cos^{-1}(0.7)$

4. Now, let's find the wetting factor Φ by using the equation:

Φ = $1 - \frac{θ}{π}$

Φ = $1 - \frac{\cos^{-1}(0.7)}{π}$

Φ = $1 - \frac{\cos^{-1}(0.7)}{3.14159}$

Φ = $1 - \frac{0.795}$

Φ = $0.205$

5. Finally, we can calculate the ratio $ΔG_(het)$ / $ΔG_(hom)$:

$\frac{ΔG_(het)}{ΔG_(hom)} = \frac{4πr_c^2γ_{αβ}\Phi}{3} * \frac{3}{4πr_c^2γ_{αβ}}$

$\frac{ΔG_(het)}{ΔG_(hom)} = 0.205$

Thus, the ratio of $ΔG_(het)$ / $ΔG_(hom)$ is approximately 0.205 (rounded off to three decimal places).

The correct answer is [0.205].
