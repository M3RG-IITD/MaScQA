The probability that the random variable x takes a value between 1 and √5 can be calculated by integrating the probability density function f(x) over this range:

∫(from 1 to √5) f(x) dx = ∫(from 1 to √5) 0.25x dx 

= 0.25 * [x^2/2] (from 1 to √5) 

= 0.25 * ((√5)^2/2 - 1/2) 

= 0.25 * (5/2 - 1/2) 

= 0.5

Therefore, the probability that the random variable x takes a value between 1 and √5 is 0.5.

Answer: [0.5]
