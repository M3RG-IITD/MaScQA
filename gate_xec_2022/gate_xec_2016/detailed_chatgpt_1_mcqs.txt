The answer is (C) Characteristic X-rays from the sample. 

Explanation:
EDS is a technique used in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to analyze the elemental composition of a material. It works by detecting X-rays emitted by the sample when it is bombarded with high-energy electrons from the SEM's electron beam. 

The SEM's electron beam interacts with the atoms in the sample, causing them to emit X-rays that are characteristic of each element. These X-rays are collected by an energy-dispersive detector and analyzed to determine the elemental composition of the sample. 

Secondary electrons (A) and backscattered electrons (B) can provide information about the surface morphology and composition of the sample, but they do not directly enable elemental identification. 

Diffraction patterns (D) can provide information about the crystal structure of the sample, but they also do not directly enable elemental identification.
