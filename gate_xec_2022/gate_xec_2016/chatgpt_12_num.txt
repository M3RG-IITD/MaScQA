We can use the Hall-Petch equation to solve the problem:

σy = σ0 + kyd^(-1/2)

where:
σy is the yield strength
σ0 is the friction stress
ky is the strengthening coefficient
d is the grain size

Using the given data, we can find k:

σy1 = σ0 + kyd1^(-1/2)
σy2 = σ0 + kyd2^(-1/2)

Subtracting the first equation from the second:

σy2 - σy1 = ky(d2^(-1/2) - d1^(-1/2))

Substituting the values:

150 - 120 = k(256^(-1/2) - 64^(-1/2))
k = 116.98 MPa μm^(1/2)


Now we can use k to find σ0:

σy1 = σ0 + kyd1^(-1/2)

120 = σ0 + 116.98(256^(-1/2))
σ0 = 85.66 MPa


Finally, we can use σ0 and k to find the expected yield strength:

σy3 = σ0 + kyd3^(-1/2)

σy3 = 85.66 + 116.98(16^(-1/2))
σy3 ≈ 214 MPa
