Let's analyze each process and match it with the corresponding product:

1. Mechanical attrition: This process involves the breaking down of solid materials into smaller particles. The method is widely used to synthesize nanoparticles. So, P matches with 3.

2. Physical vapor deposition (PVD): PVD is a coating process where a material is vaporized and then condensed on a substrate to form a thin film. Therefore, Q matches with 1.

3. Injection molding: In this process, a material (commonly plastics) is heated and forced into a mold cavity, where it cools and hardens to the form of the mold. So, R matches with 2.

4. Sintering: This process involves compacting and forming a solid mass by heat or pressure, without melting the material to the point of liquefaction. Sintering is commonly used to produce carbide tools. Hence, S matches with 5.

Thus, the correct matching is (B) P-3, Q-1, R-2, S-5.
