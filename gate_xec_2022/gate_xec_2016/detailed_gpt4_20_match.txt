First, let's define each process in Group 1 and the microstructural features in Group 2.

Group 1:
P: Quenching - Rapid cooling of the steel from high temperature.
Q: Normalizing - Heating steel to a temperature above its critical range, followed by cooling in still air.
R: Tempering - The process of reheating steel after quenching to a temperature below the critical range, then cooling it to room temperature, to enhance toughness.
S: Austempering - A heat treatment process that aims to produce a bainitic microstructure in steel, achieved by austenitizing the steel and then cooling it rapidly to a constant temperature between the austenite-to-martensite start temperature and the austenite-to-upper-bainite start temperature.

Group 2:
1: Bainite - A two-phase microstructure (ferrite and cementite) formed by relatively slow cooling or isothermal transformation of austenite.
2: Martensite - A hard, brittle, and highly strained crystal structure formed by rapidly quenching austenite below a certain temperature (martensite start temperature).
3: Pearlite - A lamellar (layered) structure of two phases, ferrite and cementite, formed by the slow cooling of austenite.
4: Iron carbide precipitates - The precipitation of cementite (Fe3C) as a consequence of holding steel at an elevated temperature to improve mechanical properties.
5: Intermetallic precipitates - A group of metal compounds formed by the reaction between two or more metallic elements in solid steel, leading to the formation of new phases that contribute to strengthening and hardening the alloy.

Now, we can match the processes to the microstructural features.

P: Quenching results in the rapid cooling of steel, producing a martensitic microstructure. So, P-2.
Q: Normalizing involves cooling in still air, allowing the steel to cool slowly and form a pearlitic microstructure. So, Q-3.
R: Tempering involves heating the steel below the critical range after quenching, leading to the formation of iron carbide precipitates. So, R-4.
S: Austempering specifically aims to produce a bainitic microstructure, so S-1.

So, the correct combination is:
P-2, Q-3, R-4, S-1

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) P-2, Q-3, R-4, S-1.
