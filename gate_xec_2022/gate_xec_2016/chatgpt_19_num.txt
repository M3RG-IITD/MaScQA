1. Calculate the number of mers in 50 g of natural rubber:
- 1 mer weighs 68 amu
- 50 g = 50,000 mg
- 1 amu = 1.66 x 10^-24 g
- Number of mers = 50,000 mg / (68 amu x 1.66 x 10^-24 g/amu) = 4.468 x 10^23 mers

2. Calculate the number of sulfur atoms added:
- 1 mol of S weighs 32 g
- 10 g of S is 10/32 mol of S
- Number of S atoms = (10/32 mol) x (6.022 x 10^23 atoms/mol) = 1.883 x 10^23 atoms

3. Calculate the maximum number of cross-links that can be formed:
- Assuming 1:1 ratio of mers and S atoms, the maximum number of S atoms that can be used to cross-link the mers is also 1.883 x 10^23 atoms
- Each cross-link connects 2 mers, so the maximum number of cross-links is (1.883 x 10^23 atoms) / 2 = 9.416 x 10^22 cross-links

4. Calculate the maximum percentage of cross-linked sites:
- Total number of sites available for cross-linking = number of mers x 2 (since each mer has 2 ends that can be cross-linked)
- Total number of sites available for cross-linking = 4.468 x 10^23 mers x 2 = 8.936 x 10^23 sites
- Maximum percentage of cross-linked sites = (number of cross-links / total number of sites) x 100%
- Maximum percentage of cross-linked sites = (9.416 x 10^22 cross-links / 8.936 x 10^23 sites) x 100% = 10.52%

Answer: The maximum percentage of cross-linked sites that could be connected is 10.52%.
