The Fermi energy is an important concept in the study of the electronic properties of materials, particularly metals. It represents the highest energy level that electrons can occupy at a given temperature, and is particularly significant in determining the electrical and thermal properties of materials.

To answer this question, let's first define what the probability of occupancy for electrons at a given energy level in a material is. This probability is given by the Fermi-Dirac distribution, which predicts the probability that an electron at a specific energy level will be occupied in a system. The Fermi-Dirac distribution is given by the formula:

P(E) = 1 / (1 + exp((E - E_F) / (k_B * T)))

Where:
- P(E) is the probability of occupancy for the electron at the energy E
- E is the energy of the electron
- E_F is the Fermi energy
- k_B is the Boltzmann constant
- T is the temperature of the material

Now, let's consider the temperature and pressure conditions mentioned in the question, which are room temperature and atmospheric pressure. At room temperature (around 300K), the Fermi energy, E_F, is the energy level for which the probability of occupancy is:

P(E_F) = 1 / (1 + exp((E_F - E_F) / (k_B * 300 K)))

Since E_F - E_F = 0, the exponential term becomes:

exp(0) = 1

So the probability of occupancy at Fermi energy becomes:

P(E_F) = 1 / (1 + 1) = 1/2

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 0.5. 

Answer: [(C) 0.5]
