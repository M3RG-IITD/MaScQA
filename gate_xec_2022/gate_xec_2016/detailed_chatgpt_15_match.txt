Ferromagnetic materials are strongly attracted to a magnet, whereas paramagnetic materials are weakly attracted. Ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic materials have more complex magnetic properties.

Nickel oxide is paramagnetic because it has unpaired electrons in its atoms. Sodium is also paramagnetic for the same reason. Magnetite is an example of a ferrimagnetic material because its atoms have magnetic moments that align in opposite directions, resulting in a net magnetic moment. Finally, cobalt is ferromagnetic, meaning it has a strong attraction to magnets.

Using this information, we can match the magnetic properties with the appropriate materials as follows:

P: Ferromagnetic - 4: Cobalt
Q: Ferrimagnetic - 3: Magnetite
R: Antiferromagnetic - 1: Nickel oxide
S: Paramagnetic - 2: Sodium

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) P-4, Q-1, R-3, S-2.
