First, we need to convert the bandgap energy from eV to Joules. We do that by multiplying the energy value in eV by the charge of an electron.

Eg = 1.8 eV * 1.6 * 10^(-19) C
Eg = 2.88 * 10^(-19) J

Now we need to find the equivalent energy of a photon with respect to wavelength. We can use the following relation between energy, Planck's constant, and wavelength for a photon:

E = h * c / λ

Where E is the energy, h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength.

Now we can solve for λ:

λ = h * c / E

Substituting the given values:

λ = (6.626 * 10^(-34) J s) * (3 * 10^8 m/s) / (2.88 * 10^(-19) J)

λ = 6.882 * 10^(-7) m

Now we need to convert the wavelength to Angstroms (1 Angstrom = 10^(-10) meters):

λ = 6.882 * 10^(-7) m * (10^10 Angstroms / 1 m)

λ = 6882 Angstroms

The threshold value of the wavelength below which this material will absorb radiation is 6882 Angstroms.

Answer: [6882]
