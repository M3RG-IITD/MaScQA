To find the threshold value of the wavelength below which this material will absorb radiation, we will first find the threshold frequency based on the given bandgap energy, and then use the speed of light to find the corresponding wavelength.

The Bandgap energy, E_g, of the semiconductor is given as 1.8 eV. We can convert this energy value to Joules using the relation between electron charge (e) and energy as follows.

1 electron volt (eV) = 1.6 * 10^(-19) Joule (J)

E_g = 1.8 eV * (1.6 * 10^(-19) J/eV)
E_g = 2.88 * 10^(-19) J

Now we can use the Planck's constant (h) and the threshold energy (E_g) to find the threshold frequency (ν) using the formula:

E_g = h * ν

We can rearrange the formula to solve for the threshold frequency:

ν = E_g / h

Plug in the values for E_g and Planck's constant (h):

ν = (2.88 * 10^(-19) J) / (6.626 * 10^(-34) J s)
ν = 4.34 * 10^14 s^(-1)

Now we have the threshold frequency; we can use the speed of light (c) to find the corresponding threshold wavelength (λ) using the formula:

c = λ * ν

We can rearrange the formula to solve for the threshold wavelength:

λ = c / ν

Plug in the values for the speed of light (c) and the threshold frequency (ν):

λ = (3 * 10^8 m/s) / (4.34 * 10^14 s^(-1))
λ = 6.91 * 10^(-7) m

Now convert this wavelength to Angstroms (Å):

1 m = 10^10 Å

λ = 6.91 * 10^(-7)m * (10^10 Å/m)
λ = 6910 Å 

Since we need the threshold value of the wavelength BELOW which this material will absorb radiation, the answer should be slightly smaller than this value. Therefore, the answer is:
