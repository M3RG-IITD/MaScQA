The Bragg's law for diffraction is given as: 

nλ = 2d sinθ

Where,
n = order of diffraction (1 in this case)
λ = wavelength of the X-rays used = 1.54 Å
d = interplanar spacing
θ = angle of diffraction

For BCC structure, the interplanar spacing (d) for (110) plane is given by:

d = a / √(h²+k²+l²)

Where, 
a = lattice parameter = 4.1Å
h, k, l = Miller indices of the plane (here, h=k=1, l=0 for (110) plane)

Substituting the values, 

d = 4.1 / √(1²+1²+0²) = 2.905 Å

Now, using Bragg's law, 

nλ = 2d sinθ

1.54 Å = 2(2.905 Å) sinθ

sinθ = 0.268

θ = sin⁻¹(0.268) = 15.63°

Therefore, the angular position θ of the first diffraction peak is 15.63°.

Answer: [15.63°]
