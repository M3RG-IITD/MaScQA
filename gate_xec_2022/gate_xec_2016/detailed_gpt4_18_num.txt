To find the probability that the random variable x takes a value between 1 and √5, we need to integrate the probability distribution function f(x) over the interval [1, √5]. 

The probability distribution function is given as f(x) = 0.25x for 1 ≤ x ≤ 3, and f(x) = 0 otherwise. Since √5 ≈ 2.236, we are interested only in the interval [1, √5] which lies within the interval [1, 3]. So, we can use the given PDF f(x) = 0.25x for our integration.

Now, let's find the probability:

P(1 ≤ x ≤ √5) = ∫[1, √5] f(x) dx

Where f(x) = 0.25x.

So, P(1 ≤ x ≤ √5) = ∫[1, √5] 0.25x dx

To integrate 0.25x with respect to x, we have:

∫0.25x dx = (0.25/2) * x^2 + C = 0.125x^2 + C

Now let's find the probability for the given interval:

P(1 ≤ x ≤ √5) = [0.125(√5)^2 - 0.125(1)^2]

P(1 ≤ x ≤ √5) = [0.125(5) - 0.125]

P(1 ≤ x ≤ √5) = [0.625 - 0.125]

P(1 ≤ x ≤ √5) = 0.5

Therefore, the probability that the random variable x takes a value between 1 and √5 is 0.5.

The correct answer is [0.5].
