We will use the Hall-Petch equation to calculate the yield strength of the steel with a 16 μm grain size. The equation is:

σ_y = σ_0 + k_y*d^(-1/2)

where:
σ_y is the yield strength
σ_0 is the friction stress
k_y is the strengthening constant
d is the grain size

We have two data points:

1) For a grain size of 256 μm, σ_y1 = 120 MPa
2) For a grain size of 64 μm, σ_y2 = 150 MPa

Substitute the values into the Hall-Petch equation:

120 = σ_0 + k_y*256^(-1/2)
150 = σ_0 + k_y*64^(-1/2)

Now we solve for σ_0 and k_y simultaneously:

k_y = 256^(-1/2) * (150 - σ_0)
k_y = 64^(-1/2) * (120 - σ_0)

Equating both:

256^(-1/2) * (150 - σ_0) = 64^(-1/2) * (120 - σ_0)

Divide both sides by 2:

128^(-1/2) * (150 - σ_0) = 32^(-1/2) * (120 - σ_0)

Now square both sides:

128 * (150 - σ_0)^2 = 32 * (120 - σ_0)^2

Further simplify:

4(150 - σ_0)^2 = (120 - σ_0)^2

Now solve for σ_0:

σ_0 = 90 MPa

Now calculate k_y using one of the data points:

k_y = 256^(-1/2) * (150 - 90)

k_y = 15 MPa*sqrt(μm)

Now we can find the yield strength for a 16 μm grain size:

σ_y3 = σ_0 + k_y*16^(-1/2)

σ_y3 = 90 + 15 * 16^(-1/2)

σ_y3 = 90 + 60

σ_y3 = 150 MPa

So the expected yield strength of the ferritic steel with a 16 μm grain size is 150 MPa.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
