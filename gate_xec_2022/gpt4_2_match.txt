P: $Cu_{0.5}Al_{0.5}$ - This is an alloy of two metals, so the bonding will be metallic.
Q: ZnS - This is a compound of a metal and a non-metal, so the bonding will be covalent.
R: $Na_2O$ - This is a compound of a metal and a non-metal, so the bonding will be ionic.
S: $Li_4SiO_4$ - This is a complex compound containing both ionic bonds (between Li and O) and covalent bonds (between Si and O), so the bonding will be mixed.

Thus, the correct matching is (C), so the answer is [C].
