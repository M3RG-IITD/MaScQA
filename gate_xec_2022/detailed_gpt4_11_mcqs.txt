To answer this question, we need to understand the concepts of enthalpy, entropy, and the glass transition temperature. 

Enthalpy (H) is a measure of the total energy in a thermodynamic system, while entropy (S) is a measure of the randomness or disorder in a system. The glass transition temperature (Tg) is the temperature at which an amorphous material (such as a glass) transitions from a rigid, glassy state to a more flexible, rubbery state.

Now, let's analyze each of the given statements:

(A) Glass has higher enthalpy than both the corresponding crystalline and liquid phases

This statement is not true because below the glass transition temperature, the glass is in a rigid and ordered state compared to the liquid phase. The enthalpy of the glass is lower than that of the liquid phase. Also, the enthalpy of a glass is generally higher than that of the corresponding crystalline phase. So, the glass has mixed behaviors with lower enthalpy than the liquid phase and higher enthalpy than the crystalline phase.

(B) Glass has lower enthalpy than both the corresponding crystalline and liquid phases

This statement is also not true because, as explained earlier, the enthalpy of glass is higher than that of the crystalline phase.

(C) Glass has higher entropy than the corresponding crystalline phase and lower entropy than the corresponding liquid phase

This statement is true. A glass is an amorphous solid, which means it has more disorder than a crystalline solid. Thus, it has higher entropy than the crystalline phase. However, it is still more ordered than the liquid phase, and therefore it has lower entropy than the liquid phase. 

(D) Glass has lower entropy than the corresponding crystalline phase and higher entropy than the corresponding liquid phase 

This statement is not true because, as explained in option (C), a glass has higher entropy than the crystalline phase and lower entropy than the liquid phase.

So, the correct answer is (C) Glass has higher entropy than the corresponding crystalline phase and lower entropy than the corresponding liquid phase.

Answer: [(C)]
