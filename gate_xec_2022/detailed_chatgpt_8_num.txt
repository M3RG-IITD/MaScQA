The number of oxygen vacancies per mole of $CeO_2$ at 1000 K is given by the following formula:

$$
n=\frac{N_A}{2}\exp\left(-\frac{E_v}{k_BT}\right)
$$

where $E_v$ is the enthalpy required to create an oxygen vacancy, $k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant, $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin, and $n$ is the number of oxygen vacancies per mole of $CeO_2$.

Substituting the given values, we get:

$$
n=\frac{6.02\times10^{23}}{2}\exp\left(-\frac{4\text{ eV}}{8.62\times10^{-5}\text{ eV/K}\times1000\text{ K}}\right) \approx 3.37\times10^{20}
$$

Rounding off to the nearest integer, we get the final answer as:

- The number of oxygen vacancies present per mole of $CeO_2$ at 1000 K is approximately 337,000,000,000,000,000,000 or 337 quintillion (rounded off to the nearest integer).
