We know that for a face-centered cubic crystal, the Miller indices of the (hkl) planes related to each peak is given by:

$h^2 + k^2 + l^2$ = even integer

For the third peak, let us assume that h=k=l, then we get:

$3h^2$ = 8

$h^2$ = 8/3

h = √(8/3) = 1.63 (approx)

Now, we can use Bragg's law to find the lattice parameter a:

$n\lambda$ = 2d sin θ

where n=1 for first-order reflection, λ=1.54 Å and θ=45°.

We know that the distance between adjacent (hkl) planes is given by:

$d$ = $\frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2+k^2+l^2}}$

For the (111) plane, d can be calculated as follows:

$d_{111}$ = $\frac{a}{\sqrt{1^2+1^2+1^2}}$ = $\frac{a}{\sqrt{3}}$

At the third peak, the angle of diffraction for the (111) plane is 45°. Therefore, we get:

$1\cdot1.54$ = $2d_{111}sin\theta$

Substituting the values of d and sin θ, we get:

$a$ = $2d_{111}\sqrt{3}$ = $\frac{2\cdot1.54}{\sqrt{3}\cdot sin 45^\circ}$

Therefore, 

$a$ = 3.55 Å (approx)

Answer: [3.55].
