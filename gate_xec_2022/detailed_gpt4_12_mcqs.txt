Unfortunately, I cannot view the image you are referring to. However, I can provide you a general guideline on how to determine which sample of high-purity aluminum single crystal will plastically yield at the lowest applied load under ambient conditions.

Here is what we think when considering the weak direction along with applied load under ambient conditions for single crystals:

1. Crystal orientation: The orientation of the crystal lattice plays a significant role in determining the mechanical strength of single crystals. When a load is applied in the weak direction of the crystal, it will cause deformation (yielding) at a relatively lower applied load compared to the other directions.

2. Crystallographic defects: Defects such as dislocations and cracks play a crucial role in the deformation behavior of crystalline materials. A sample with fewer defects and dislocations will generally have better mechanical properties, yielding at a higher applied load.

3. Grain boundaries: If the sample is not a perfect single crystal and contains small misorientations or grain boundaries, it can generate stress concentrations that will lead to plastic yielding at a lower applied load.

Considering these factors, you can assess which one of the given samples (i, ii, iii, or iv) will have the lowest plastic yield at the applied load. Unfortunately, without an image, I am unable to provide a specific answer for this question. However, these general guidelines should help you analyze the problem and determine the correct answer in your situation.
