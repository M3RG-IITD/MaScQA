To solve this problem, we'll use the concept of stress relaxation. Stress relaxation is a time-dependent decrease in stress that occurs when a material is subjected to a constant strain.

1. First, let's find the relaxation modulus, which is the ratio of the stress to the strain.

Relaxation modulus (E) = Stress / Strain

Strain is given in percentage, so we'll convert it to a decimal value by dividing by 100.

Initial strain (%) = 50%
Initial strain (decimal) = 50 / 100 = 0.5

The initial stress is given as 10 MPa. So using the relaxation modulus definition:

Initial relaxation modulus (E1) = Initial stress / Initial strain
E1 = 10 MPa / 0.5
E1 = 20 MPa

2. Now, let's find the relaxation modulus after 40 days, when the stress decreases to 5 MPa.

Final stress after 40 days (S2) = 5 MPa

Strain during this time is constant (50% or 0.5 as a decimal value). Using the relaxation modulus definition:

Final relaxation modulus after 40 days (E2) = Final stress / Constant strain
E2 = 5 MPa / 0.5
E2 = 10 MPa

3. Now, we need to find the relationship between the relaxation modulus and time. For this, we will assume that the relationship is linear, which is a common simplification for materials like elastomers.

E2 = E1 - k * t1
Where E2 is the final relaxation modulus after 40 days, E1 is the initial relaxation modulus, k is the relaxation constant, and t1 is the time (40 days).

We can find the relaxation constant (k):

10 MPa = 20 MPa - k * 40
k = (20 MPa - 10 MPa) / 40
k = 0.25 MPa/day

4. Now we can use the relaxation constant to estimate the relaxation modulus after 60 days (E3):

E3 = E1 - k * t2
Where E1 is the initial relaxation modulus, k is the relaxation constant, and t2 is the time after 60 days (60 days).

E3 = 20 MPa - 0.25 MPa/day * 60 days
E3 = 20 MPa - 15 MPa
E3 = 5 MPa

5. Finally, we can use the estimated relaxation modulus after 60 days to find the stress after 60 days, keeping the strain constant:

Stress after 60 days (S3) = E3 * Constant strain
S3 = 5 MPa * 0.5
S3 = 2.5 MPa

So the stress after 60 days at 20Â°C is approximately 2.5 MPa.

The correct answer is [2.5 MPa].
