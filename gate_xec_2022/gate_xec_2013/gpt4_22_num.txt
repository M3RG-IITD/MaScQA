To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate of stress relaxation. We can do this by finding the ratio of the stress reduction to the amount of time that has passed.

Initial stress (σ₁) = 10 MPa
Final stress (σ₂) = 5 MPa
Initial strain (ε) = 50%
Time period (t₁) = 40 days

Stress reduction (Δσ) = σ₁ - σ₂ = 10 MPa - 5 MPa = 5 MPa
Rate of stress relaxation (r) = Δσ / t₁ = 5 MPa / 40 days = 0.125 MPa/day

Now we need to find the stress after 60 days at 20°C.

Time period (t₂) = 60 days

Stress reduction after 60 days (Δσ₂) = r * t₂ = 0.125 MPa/day * 60 days = 7.5 MPa

Finally, we'll subtract the stress reduction after 60 days from the initial stress to get the stress after 60 days at 20°C.

Stress after 60 days (σ₃) = σ₁ - Δσ₂ = 10 MPa - 7.5 MPa = 2.5 MPa

So, the stress after 60 days at 20°C will be 2.5 MPa.

Answer: [2.5 MPa]
