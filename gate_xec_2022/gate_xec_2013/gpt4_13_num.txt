To calculate the wavelength of the X-ray, we can use Bragg's Law:

nλ = 2d * sin(θ)

where n is the order of diffraction (in this case n = 1, since it's the first peak), λ is the wavelength, d is the interplanar spacing, and θ is half of the 2θ angle.

First, we need to calculate the interplanar spacing (d) for the FCC {200} planes. The general formula for interplanar spacing in cubic crystals is:

d = a / √(h² + k² + l²)

where a is the lattice parameter (0.352nm), and h, k, and l are the Miller indices (in this case {200}, h=2, k=0, l=0).

d = 0.352 / √(2² + 0² + 0²) = 0.352 / √(4) = 0.352 / 2 = 0.176 nm

Now, we can use Bragg's Law with θ = (1/2) * 61.08° = 30.54°:

λ = 2 * d * sin(θ) / n

λ = 2 * 0.176 * sin(30.54°) / 1

λ ≈ 0.175 nm

The wavelength of the X-ray used is approximately 0.175 nm.

Answer: [0.175]
