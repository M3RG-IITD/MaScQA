We can use the equation for linear thermal expansion:

$\Delta L=L\alpha \Delta T$

where:

$\Delta L$ is the change in length
$L$ is the original length (50 cm in this case)
$\alpha$ is the coefficient of linear thermal expansion for brass (20 * $10^(-6)$ °$C^(-1)$)
$\Delta T$ is the change in temperature (70°C - 20°C = 50°C)

At 70°C, the brass rod will have expanded by:

$\Delta L = L \alpha \Delta T = (50\ cm)(20 \times 10^{-6}\ °C^{-1})(50\ °C) = 0.05\ cm$

We want to find the distance, x, that the rod needs to be set from the lever to break the circuit at this point. When the brass rod touches the lever, it pushes it down by a distance equal to its own expansion. Therefore, if we set x = 0.05 cm, the circuit will be broken at 70°C.

Answer: [0.05] cm (or 0.5 mm)
