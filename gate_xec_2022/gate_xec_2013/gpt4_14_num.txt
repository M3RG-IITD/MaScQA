To determine the volume of the hexagonal close-packed (HCP) unit cell, we need to use the following formula:

Volume = $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}a^2c$

where a is the lattice constant a and c is the lattice constant c.

Let's plug in the values of the lattice constants provided:

Volume = $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}(0.30\,nm)^2(0.56\,nm)$

Now let's compute the result:

Volume ≈ $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}(0.09\,nm^2)(0.56\,nm)$
Volume ≈ $(0.49039)(0.0504\,nm^3)$
Volume ≈ $0.0247\,nm^3$

So, the volume of the unit cell of this metal is approximately 0.0247 $nm^3$.

Answer: [0.0247]
