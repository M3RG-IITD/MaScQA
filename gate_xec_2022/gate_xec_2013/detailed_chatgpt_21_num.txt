The relaxation modulus of an elastomer is given by:

$$ E_r(t) = \frac{\sigma_0}{\epsilon(t)} $$

where $\sigma_0$ is the initial stress, $\epsilon(t)$ is the strain at time $t$. For a constant strain $\epsilon_0$, the relaxation modulus reduces to:

$$ E_r(t) = \frac{\sigma_0}{\epsilon_0} $$

The time-dependent behavior of the material can be described by the following differential equation:

$$ \frac{d\sigma}{dt} = -\frac{\sigma}{\tau} $$

where $\sigma$ is the stress at time $t$, and $\tau$ is the relaxation time constant.

The solution to this equation can be found by separation of variables and integration:

$$ \ln{\frac{\sigma}{\sigma_0}} = -\frac{t}{\tau} $$

$$ \sigma = \sigma_0 e^{-\frac{t}{\tau}} $$

At time $t=0$ the stress is $\sigma_0$, and at time $t=40$ days the stress is $\sigma_1=5$ MPa. The relaxation modulus can be written as:

$$ E_r(t) = \frac{\sigma_0}{\epsilon_0} e^{\frac{t}{\tau}} $$

At time $t=40$ days, the relaxation modulus is:

$$ E_r(40) = \frac{10}{0.5} e^{\frac{40}{\tau}} $$

Using the stress value $\sigma_1=5$ MPa, we can solve for the relaxation time constant:

$$ \sigma_1 = \frac{\sigma_0}{E_r(40)} = \frac{10}{0.5} e^{\frac{40}{\tau}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sigma_0} $$

$$ \tau = -\frac{40}{\ln{\frac{5}{20}}} \approx 47.62\text{ days} $$

Therefore, the relaxation time constant for this material is approximately 47.62 days.
