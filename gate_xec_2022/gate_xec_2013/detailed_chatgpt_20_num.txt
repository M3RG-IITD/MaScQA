The first step is to locate the point representing the composition of the alloy on the phase diagram. This point lies within the two-phase (α + L) region, meaning that the alloy is partly solid and partly liquid.

Next, we need to read off the weight percentage of liquid from the phase diagram. At 1300° C, the tie line intersects the liquidus boundary at a weight percentage of approximately 69 wt% liquid.

Therefore, we can calculate the weight percentage of liquid in the alloy using the lever rule:

liquid wt% = (100 - α wt%) * L / (L + α)

where α and L are the weight percentages of solid and liquid, respectively, and we want to solve for L.

Plugging in the given values, we have:

liquid wt% = (100 - 47 wt%) * 69 wt% / (69 wt% + 53 wt%)

liquid wt% = 53.8 wt%

Therefore, approximately 53.8 wt% of the alloy is liquid.

Answer: 

- Approximately 53.8 wt% of the alloy is liquid.
