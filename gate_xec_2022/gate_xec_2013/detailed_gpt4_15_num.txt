To find the minimum wavelength of the radiation emitted by the LED, we can use the formula:

E = h * c / λ

Where E is the energy of the photon (in this case, the band gap), h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength of the radiation. We are given the band gap (E) and we want to find the minimum wavelength (λ).

First, we need to convert the band gap from electron volts (eV) to joules (J). We know that:

1 eV = 1.60218 × 10^(-19) J

So, the band gap in joules is:

E = 1.43 eV × (1.60218 × 10^(-19) J/eV) = 2.28912 × 10^(-19) J

Now, we can plug in the known values (h and c) into the formula:

E = h * c / λ

Where h = 6.63 × 10^(-34) Js (Planck's constant) and c = 3 × 10^8 m/s (speed of light).

Rearranging the formula to solve for λ:

λ = h * c / E

Plugging in the known values:

λ = (6.63 × 10^(-34) Js) * (3 × 10^8 m/s) / (2.28912 × 10^(-19) J)

λ = (1.989 × 10^(-25) Jm) / (2.28912 × 10^(-19) J)

λ = 8.688 × 10^(-7) m

Since we want the answer in μm:

λ = 8.688 × 10^(-7) m * (10^6 μm/m) = 0.8688 μm

So the minimum wavelength of the radiation emitted by this LED is approximately 0.8688 μm.

Answer: [0.8688]
