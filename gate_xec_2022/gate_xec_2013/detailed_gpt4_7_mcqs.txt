Young's modulus is a measure of a material's stiffness or resistance to deformation under an applied load. In carbon fiber reinforced resin composites, the fibers provide the strength and stiffness, while the resin matrix holds everything together and provides some level of flexibility.

For a given fiber volume content, the orientation of the fibers within the composite will influence the effective Young's modulus. Let's analyze each of the orientations mentioned:

(A) Transverse Orientation: When the fibers are oriented perpendicular (transverse) to the applied load, the load is mostly carried by the resin matrix. Since the resin has a lower Young's modulus than carbon fibers, the effective Young's modulus of the composite would be lower.

(B) Longitudinal Orientation: In this case, the fibers are oriented parallel (longitudinal) to the applied load. The load is carried mainly by the carbon fibers, which can resist the load better than the resin matrix due to their high Young's modulus. The effective Young's modulus of the composite would be significantly higher than in the transverse case.

(C) Random Orientation: Fibers are randomly oriented within the composite, so the load is shared among fibers and the resin matrix, depending on the fiber volume and distribution. As a result, the effective Young's modulus of the composite will be somewhere between that of transverse and longitudinal orientations.

(D) Both transverse and longitudinal: This option appears to combine the first two orientations, which would mean some fibers are aligned longitudinally and others transversely. However, option D does not present a new orientation and actually introduces redundancy to the solutions. 

Considering the analysis above, the orientation of the fibers that results in the highest effective Young's modulus for the composite is the longitudinal orientation.

So the correct answer is:
