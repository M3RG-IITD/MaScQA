The maximum value of Young's modulus in carbon fiber reinforced resin composites is obtained when the fibers are aligned parallel to the direction of the applied load. This orientation is known as the longitudinal orientation. 

Explanation:

Carbon fiber reinforced resin composites are materials that consist of high-strength carbon fibers embedded in a polymer matrix. The properties of these materials are highly anisotropic, meaning that they vary depending on the direction in which they are measured. The orientation of the fibers in the composite has a significant effect on its mechanical properties, including Young's modulus.

The Young's modulus of a material is a measure of its stiffness or resistance to deformation under an applied load. It is defined as the ratio of stress to strain in the linear elastic region of the material's stress-strain curve. In an anisotropic material like carbon fiber reinforced resin composites, the Young's modulus varies depending on the direction of the applied load relative to the orientation of the fibers.

When the fibers are aligned parallel to the direction of the applied load, they are under tension and can bear the majority of the load. This orientation results in a higher Young's modulus compared to when the fibers are oriented perpendicular to the applied load, as they are then unable to resist the load as effectively.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) longitudinal. 

Note that options (A) transverse, (C) random, and (D) both transverse and longitudinal are incorrect because the transverse and randomly oriented fibers provide less resistance to the applied load and hence result in a lower Young's modulus compared to the longitudinal orientation.
