Given the properties of the two-phase mixture, let's denote the weight percentages of A and B in phase α as W_Aα and W_Bα, and the weight percentages of A and B in phase β as W_Aβ and W_Bβ. Similarly, let the mole fractions of A and B in phase α be X_Aα and X_Bα, and in phase β be X_Aβ and X_Bβ. Also, let's denote the atomic mass of A as M_A and that of B as M_B.

Let's analyze the given properties: 

(i) Phase α has equal weight percentages of A and B.

→ W_Aα = W_Bα

(ii) Phase β has twice the mole fraction of A compared to B.

→ X_Aβ = 2 * X_Bβ

(iii) The two-phase mixture has equal amounts of α and β.

→ Let the mass of phase α be m_α and the mass of phase β be m_β, so:

m_α = m_β

(iv) Atomic mass of A is twice that of B.

→ M_A = 2 * M_B

Now, let's begin by determining the mole fractions of A and B in phase α.

Since we have equal weight percentages of A and B, we can consider W_Aα = W_Bα = 50%.

To convert weight percentages to mole fractions, we can use the formula:

X_Aα = (W_Aα / M_A) / [(W_Aα / M_A) + (W_Bα / M_B)]

Inserting the given values, we get:

X_Aα = (50 / 2 * M_B) / [(50 / 2 * M_B) + (50 / M_B)] → Note that we replaced M_A with 2 * M_B.

Simplifying the equation, we get:

X_Aα = 1 / (1 + 1) = 1 / 2

So, X_Bα = 1 - X_Aα = 1/2

Now let's determine the mole fractions of A and B in phase β.

Given that phase β has twice the mole fraction of A compared to B, X_Aβ = 2 * X_Bβ, and since the sum of mole fractions should be 1, we can write:

2 * X_Bβ + X_Bβ = 1

This gives:

X_Bβ = 1/3

So, X_Aβ = 2 * X_Bβ = 2/3

Now, we can determine the mole fraction of A in the resultant two-phase mixture. Since the mixture has equal amounts of α and β:

X_A = (m_α * X_Aα + m_β * X_Aβ) / (m_α + m_β)

Since m_α = m_β, we can write:

X_A = (m_α * (1/2) + m_β * (2/3)) / (m_α + m_β)

Substituting m_β = m_α, we get:

X_A = (m_α * (1/2) + m_α * (2/3)) / (2 * m_α)

This simplifies to:

X_A = (1/2 + 2/3) / 2 = (3/6 + 4/6) / 2 = 7/12

Rounding off the mole fraction of A in the resultant two-phase mixture to one decimal, we get:

X_A = 0.6 (rounded off to one decimal)

So, the mole fraction of A in the resultant two-phase mixture is 0.6.

The correct answer is inside the list:

[0.6]
