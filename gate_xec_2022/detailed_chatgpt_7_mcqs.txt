The correct answer is:

- (B) Yield strength of A is greater than B

Explanation:

Vickers microhardness (HV) is a measure of a material's resistance to indentation, which is a function of both its ductility and its yield strength. Since material A has a higher microhardness than material B, it means that material A has a higher yield strength than material B. 

Young's modulus is a measure of a material's stiffness or elastic modulus, and it is not directly related to its hardness. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the Young's modulus of A is greater than B based on the information given.

Scratch resistance is related to the hardness and toughness of a material. While higher microhardness can indicate greater scratch resistance, it does not necessarily mean that A has greater scratch resistance than B. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the scratch resistance of A is greater than B based on the information given.

Ductility is a measure of a material's ability to deform before breaking. Since material A has a higher microhardness than material B, it means that material A is less ductile than material B. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the ductility of A is greater than B based on the information given.
