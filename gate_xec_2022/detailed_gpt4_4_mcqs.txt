An intrinsic semiconductor is a pure semiconductor material, like silicon (Si) or germanium (Ge), without any impurities or dopants. The conductivity of these materials is exclusively determined by the intrinsic characteristics of the material and is influenced by temperature and pressure. Let's analyze each statement one by one to find the correct answer:

(A) Electrical conductivity increases with increasing temperature and pressure:

As the temperature of an intrinsic semiconductor increases, the number of thermally-generated free charge carriers (electrons and holes) increases. As a result, the electrical conductivity of the intrinsic semiconductor will increase with increasing temperature. However, the pressure does not have a significant impact on the electrical conductivity of intrinsic semiconductors.

(B) Electrical conductivity increases with increasing temperature and decreasing pressure:

This option is also incorrect because, as mentioned above, the pressure does not have a significant impact on the electrical conductivity of intrinsic semiconductors.

(C) Electrical conductivity increases with decreasing temperature and increasing pressure:

As we discussed earlier, the electrical conductivity of an intrinsic semiconductor increases with increasing temperature. Thus, this option contradicts the known behavior of intrinsic semiconductors.

(D) Electrical conductivity increases with decreasing temperature and pressure:

This statement is also incorrect since the electrical conductivity increases with increasing temperature, not decreasing temperature. And pressure does not have a significant impact on the electrical conductivity of intrinsic semiconductors.

In conclusion, none of the provided statements is accurately describing the behavior of intrinsic semiconductors. However, a correct statement would be that the electrical conductivity of an intrinsic semiconductor increases with increasing temperature, and pressure does not significantly impact conductivity.

The correct answer, taking into account the explanation above, would be:

[Electrical conductivity of an intrinsic semiconductor increases with increasing temperature, and pressure does not significantly impact conductivity.]
