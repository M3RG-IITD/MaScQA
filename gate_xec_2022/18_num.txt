Diffusivity of A in the solid is given by: $D_A$ = $(D_A)°*exp(-{E_a/k_(B)T})$. $(D_A)°$: Diffusivity coefficient, $E_a$: Activation energy = 0.3 eV, $k_B$:  Boltzmann’s constant = 8.62*$10^(-5)$eV/K, 𝑇: Absolute temperature. It is known that component A diffuses into a solid to a depth of 10 μm in 1 hour at 300 K. Treat diffusion in one dimension. The time(in seconds) taken for A to diffuse to the same depth at 600 K is? (Round off to 1 decimal).
