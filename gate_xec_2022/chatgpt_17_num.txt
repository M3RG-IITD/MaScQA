The mole fraction of A in the resultant two-phase mixture is 0.609.

Explanation:

Let's assume that we have 100 g of the mixture.

From property (iii), we know that 50 g of the mixture is in phase alpha and 50 g of the mixture is in phase beta.

From property (i), we know that the weight percentage of A in phase alpha is 50%.

Let's assume that there are "x" moles of A and "y" moles of B in the mixture.

From property (ii), we know that:

moles of A in beta = 2*(moles of B in beta)

x/(x+y) = 2*y/(x+y)

x = 2*y

From property (iv), we know that:

atomic mass of A = 2*(atomic mass of B)

So, the ratio of the masses of A and B in the mixture is:

2*(moles of A)*(atomic mass of A) : (moles of B)*(atomic mass of B)

2x(2A) : y(B)

4x : y

Since we have equal amounts of alpha and beta, we can set up the following equation:

50*(4x)/(4x+y) = 50*(y)/(2x+y)

After solving this equation, we get:

x/y = 1.414

Using x = 2*y, we get:

x = 0.8496

y = 0.6006

Therefore, the mole fraction of A in the mixture is:

x/(x+y) = 0.609 (rounded off to one decimal)

Answer: [0.609]
