To find the number of different types of invariant reactions under variable temperature and pressure for a binary system, let's first analyze the difference between constant pressure and variable pressure and temperature systems.

1. Constant pressure: In this case, P is fixed, and we have one degree of freedom (F = 1). According to the Gibbs phase rule, F = C - P + 2, where C is the number of components and P is the number of phases. Thus, for a binary system, C = 2.

Under constant pressure, we can have two types of invariant reactions:
(i) α ↔ β + γ: In this case, there are 3 phases (P = 3), and substituting in the Gibbs phase rule, we get F = 2 - 3 + 2 = 1. Hence, this is a valid reaction for constant pressure.
(ii) α + β ↔ γ: In this case, there are 2 phases (P = 2), and substituting in the Gibbs phase rule, we get F = 2 - 2 + 2 = 2. This is not an invariant reaction under constant pressure, as we have one extra degree of freedom.

2. Variable temperature and pressure: Now, we have two degrees of freedom (F = 2).

Let's analyze the given reaction types for the variable temperature and pressure:
(i) α ↔ β + γ: There are 3 phases (P = 3). Substituting in the Gibbs phase rule, F = 2 - 3 + 2 = 1. This is not an invariant reaction under variable temperature and pressure, as we lack one degree of freedom.
(ii) α + β ↔ γ: There are 2 phases (P = 2). Substituting in the Gibbs phase rule, F = 2 - 2 + 2 = 2. This is a valid invariant reaction under variable temperature and pressure.

Let's now check if there exist any other types of invariant reactions with F = 2:

(iii) α ↔ β: There are 2 phases (P = 2). Substituting in the Gibbs phase rule, F = 2 - 2 + 2 = 2. This is a valid invariant reaction under variable temperature and pressure.
(iv) α + β + γ ↔ None: There are no phases (P = 0). Substituting in the Gibbs phase rule, F = 2 - 0 + 2 = 4. This is not an invariant reaction under variable temperature and pressure, as we have two extra degrees of freedom.

Hence, there are two different types of invariant reactions that may exist under variable temperature and pressure for a binary system: α + β ↔ γ and α ↔ β.

So, the answer is (B) 2.
