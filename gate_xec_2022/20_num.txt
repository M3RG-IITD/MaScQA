Given: $𝑁_A$: Avogadro’s number = 6.02 * $10^(23)mole^(-1)$, $𝑘_B$: Boltzmann’s constant = 8.62 * $10^(-5)$ eV/K, 𝑇: Absolute temperature, Mobility of electrons in the semiconductor = 0.14 $m^2$/(V s), Mobility of holes in the semiconductor = 0.06 $m^2$/(V s), Absolute charge of an electron = 1.60 * $10^(-19) C. The resistivity of a pure semiconductor at 298 K is 3000 Ωm. Assume that the number of electrons excited ($𝑛_e$) across the band gap is given by the relation $n_e$ = $(N_A)*exp(-{E_g/k_(B)T})$. The band gap(in ev) ($𝐸_g$) of the semiconductor is? (Round off to two decimals)
