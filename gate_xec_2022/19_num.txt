Given: ∆$G_(hom)$ = Gibbs free energy change at the critical radius for homogeneous nucleation, ∆$G_(het)$ = Gibbs free energy change at the critical radius for heterogeneous nucleation. α-β interfacial energy = 0.4 $J/m^2$, α-δ interfacial energy = 0.3 $J/m^2$, β-δ interfacial energy = 0.02 $J/m^2$. A spherical β particle nucleates from the α matrix on a non-deformable substrate δ, forming a contact angle of θ as shown in the image. The value of $ΔG_(het)$/$ΔG_(hom)$ is?(round off to three decimal places)
