To find the number of oxygen vacancies present per mole of CeO2 at 1000 K, we need to use the Boltzmann distribution formula:

n_vacancy = N_total * exp(-ΔH / (k_B * T))

where n_vacancy represents the number of vacancies, N_total is the total number of oxygen atoms, ΔH represents the enthalpy required to create a vacancy, k_B is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

Given: 
ΔH = 4 eV (enthalpy required to create a vacancy)
N_A = 6.02 * 10^23 atoms/mol (Avogadro's number)
k_B = 8.62 * 10^(-5) eV/K (Boltzmann's constant)
T = 1000 K (temperature)

Now let's plug in the given values into the formula:

n_vacancy = N_A * exp(-ΔH / (k_B * T))
n_vacancy = (6.02 * 10^23) * exp(-4 / (8.62 * 10^(-5) * 1000))

Now simplify the expression within the exponential:

-4 / (8.62 * 10^(-5) * 1000) ≈ -46.17

Then calculate the exponential value:

exp(-46.17) ≈ 9.04 * 10^(-21)

Now multiply Avogadro's number by the exponential value:

n_vacancy = (6.02 * 10^23) * (9.04 * 10^(-21))
n_vacancy ≈ 5.43 * 10^3

Finally, rounding to the nearest integer, we get the number of oxygen vacancies per mole of CeO2 at 1000 K:

n_vacancy ≈ 5431

So, there are approximately 5431 oxygen vacancies present per mole of CeO2 at 1000 K.

The correct answer is: [5431].
