Step 1: Convert energy values from electron volts (eV) to Joules
First, let's convert the given energy values into SI unit (Joules). We are given the following values:
Energy of photon (x-ray): E_photon = 1.54 keV
Bandgap of silicon (E_g): E_g = 1.1 eV

1 eV = 1.602 × 10^(-19) J, so we get:

E_photon (Joules) = 1.54 × 10^3 eV × 1.602 × 10^(-19) J/eV ≈ 2.47 × 10^(-16) J
E_g (Joules) = 1.1 eV × 1.602 × 10^(-19) J/eV ≈ 1.76 × 10^(-19) J

Step 2: Calculate the maximum number of electron-hole pairs
Since one electron-hole pair can be generated by one photon with energy equal to the bandgap of silicon (1.1 eV), the maximum number of electron-hole pairs that can be generated using a single x-ray of energy 1.54 keV would be the ratio of the total energy of the x-ray photon to the energy required to create one electron-hole pair.

Max electron-hole pairs = E_photon / E_g
= (2.47 × 10^(-16) J) / (1.76 × 10^(-19) J)
≈ 14.03

Since we cannot have a fraction of an electron-hole pair, we need to consider the maximum whole number of electron-hole pairs, which is the largest integer less than or equal to 14.03, i.e., 14.

So, the maximum number of electron-hole pairs that can be generated using a silicon detector irradiated by an x-ray of energy 1.54 keV is [14].
