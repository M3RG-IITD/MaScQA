The energy required to generate an electron-hole pair in silicon is 1.1 eV, which is the band gap energy of silicon. 

We can use the following formula to calculate the number of electron-hole pairs generated: 

Number of electron-hole pairs = (Energy of x-ray photon) / (Energy required to generate an electron-hole pair)

First, we need to convert the energy of the x-ray photon from keV to eV: 

1.54 keV = 1540 eV 

Now we can substitute the values into the formula: 

Number of electron-hole pairs = 1540 eV / 1.1 eV = 1400 

Therefore, the maximum number of electron-hole pairs that can be generated using a silicon detector irradiated by x-ray of energy 1.54 keV is 1400. 

Answer: 

- 1400
