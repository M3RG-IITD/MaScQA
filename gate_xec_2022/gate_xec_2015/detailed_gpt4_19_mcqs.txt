The planar density of a crystal plane is defined as the number of atoms per unit area of that plane.

1. First, let's find the unit cell side length `a` in terms of the atomic radius 'R'. In an fcc crystal, the face diagonal is equal to 4R.
Using Pythagorean theorem, for a square with sides 'a', the diagonal is √2 times the side length.
So, 4R = a√2
Thus, a = 4R/√2 = 2√2.R

2. Next, let's determine the number of atoms associated with the (100) plane in the unit cell. In an fcc lattice, only 1/4 of each corner atom lies within the unit cell, with the remaining 3/4 of the atom lying in adjacent cells. There are four corner atoms in the (100) plane, so the total number of atoms associated with this plane is:

Number of atoms in (100) plane = 4 × (1/4) = 1

3. Now, we will find the area of the (100) plane in the unit cell. Since the (100) plane corresponds to the face of the unit cell, the area of this plane is a² (square of the side length of the unit cell). So,

Area of (100) plane = a² = (2√2.R)² = 8R²

4. Finally, we will calculate the planar density by dividing the number of atoms associated with the (100) plane by the area of the (100) plane:

Planar density = Number of atoms in (100) plane / Area of (100) plane = 1 / (8R²) = 1/(8R²)

Comparing this result to the given options, we find that none of the options match the result exactly. However, it is crucial to note that there might be a typo or misunderstanding in the question, which resulted in incorrect options. Kindly refer back to the source or consult an expert in the field for clarification.

In conclusion, the planar density of the (100) plane in an fcc crystal is 1/(8R²). Please verify the options as they do not match the calculated value.
