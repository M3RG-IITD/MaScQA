To determine which of these options is NOT a ceramic forming process, let's first discuss each one of them and then conclude which one doesn't belong to the ceramics processing category.

(A) Extrusion: In the extrusion process, a mixture of ceramic powder and binder is forced through a shaping die, forming a continuous profile of desired cross-sectional shape. This process is widely used for forming ceramic tubes, rods, and other specific shapes. Therefore, extrusion is a ceramic forming process.

(B) Slip casting: Slip casting is a process in which a liquid slurry of ceramic powder (with water and other additives) is poured into a porous mold, typically made of plaster of Paris. The mold absorbs the water from the slurry, leaving a layer of consolidated ceramic powder on its surface. Once the desired thickness of the ceramic is achieved, the remaining slurry is removed, and the dried ceramic is taken out of the mold. This process is particularly suitable for complex shapes and large-scale productions, and it is extensively used in the ceramics industry. Thus, slip casting is a ceramic forming process.

(C) Forging: Forging is a metal forming process that uses compressive stresses to change the shape of a material, usually by a hammer or press. The metal is heated to high temperatures, making it more ductile and easy to deform. Forging is widely used in the production of metal components with improved mechanical properties. However, ceramics are brittle, making them unsuitable for this process. They cannot be easily deformed like metals when subjected to compressive stresses. So, forging is NOT a ceramic forming process.

(D) Tape casting: Tape casting is a process in which a thin, flat layer of ceramic slurry, known as "tape," is produced by spreading it evenly on a flat surface or substrate using a doctor blade or a similar tool. The tape is then dried, and binder is removed, after which the tape can be cut, laminated, or processed further into desired shapes or dimensions. This method is widely used in the manufacturing of multilayered ceramic components (e.g., capacitors, fuel cells, etc.). Therefore, tape casting is a ceramic forming process.

In conclusion, the correct answer is (C) forging, as it is not a ceramic forming process. The other three options, (A) extrusion, (B) slip casting, and (D) tape casting, are all methods used for ceramics processing. So the answer is:
