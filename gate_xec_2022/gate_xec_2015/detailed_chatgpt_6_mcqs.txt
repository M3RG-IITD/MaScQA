The answer is (C) forging. 

Explanation:
Ceramic forming processes include various techniques to create ceramic products in desired shapes and dimensions. The commonly used ceramic forming processes are as follows:

A) Extrusion: It is a process for creating objects of a fixed cross-sectional profile. In ceramic forming, this process is used to create long and strait columns such as pipes and tiles.

B) Slip casting: It is a process that involves pouring a slurry of ceramic particles and liquid into a porous mold. The liquid is then absorbed by the mold leaving the solidified ceramic shape. Slip casting is commonly used in the production of pottery and figurines.

C) Forging: Forging is a process of shaping metals by hammering or pressing at high temperatures. It is not a ceramic forming process. 

D) Tape casting: It is a process that involves forming a thin layer of ceramic slurry onto a flexible substrate using a doctor blade. The ceramic material is dried, and the substrate can be peeled off to create flexible ceramic sheets. This process is commonly used in the production of electronic components.

Therefore, option (C) forging is not a ceramic forming process.
