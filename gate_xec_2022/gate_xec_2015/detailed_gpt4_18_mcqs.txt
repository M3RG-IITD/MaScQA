To solve this question, we need to understand the various terms mentioned in the options.

(A) The maximum energy a solid can absorb elastically is known as the elastic limit or modulus of elasticity. In this region of deformation, the solid returns to its original shape after the load is removed. This is not the meaning of creep in metals.

(B) The maximum energy a solid can absorb by plastic deformation is known as the plastic limit. Plastic deformation is permanent deformation, which means the solid remains in the deformed state even after the load is removed. While creep could be a type of plastic deformation, it is not solely defined by the maximum energy a solid can absorb.

(C) The stress at which plastic deformation starts is known as the yield strength of a material. This stress value marks the transition from elastic to plastic deformation. Creep might start at stress values near or above the yield strength, but this definition does not capture the essence of creep.

(D) Creep is a phenomenon in which metals and materials, particularly at high temperature (T > half the melting point), undergo slow and progressive plastic deformation over time. This is due to the stress-induced diffusion of atoms within the crystal lattice, causing rearrangement of atoms which results in the observed deformation.

Based on the given definitions, the correct answer for creep in metals is:

[(D) slow plastic deformation due to diffusion of atoms usually at high temperature (T > half the melting point)]
