P. DSC (Differential Scanning Calorimetry) is a technique used to measure the Glass transition temperature and Thermal expansion coefficient of materials through its behavior towards heat flow.

Q. XRD (X-ray diffraction) is used to determine the Crystal structure of materials by analyzing how the material reflects X-ray in a specific pattern.

R. STM (Scanning Tunneling Microscopy) observes the surface of a material to identify Cathodoluminescence, which is the emission of light.

S. SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) measures the Density of states of a material by observing the patterns of the electrons in the sample at high levels of magnification.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(C) P-2, Q-4, R-1, S-3
