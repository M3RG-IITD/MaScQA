In order to determine how much the mass of an electron increases when traveling at 96% the speed of light, we'll need to use the relativistic equation for mass:

m = m0 / √(1 - v^2/c^2)

where:
m is the relativistic mass of the electron
m0 is the rest mass of the electron
v is the velocity of the electron (0.96c)
c is the speed of light

Setting up the equation:

m = m0 / √(1 - (0.96c)^2/c^2)

m = m0 / √(1 - 0.96^2)

m = m0 / √(1 - 0.9216)

m = m0 / √(0.0784)

m = m0 / 0.28

The mass of the electron would increase by a factor of approximately 3.57 times its original mass when traveling at 96% the speed of light.
