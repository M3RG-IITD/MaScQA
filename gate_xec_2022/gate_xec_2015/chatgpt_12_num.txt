Given: 

The linear thermal expansion coefficient of iron = $\alpha$ = 11.0 × $10^{−6}$ $K^{−1}$ 

The change in temperature = ΔT = (45 − 15)°C = 30°C

The change in length of the iron rail track = ΔL = +0.05 cm

To find: The original length of the iron rail track (L)


Formula: 

The change in length of the material = α × L × ΔT 

Where L is the original length 


Solution:

The change in length of the iron rail track = ΔL = α × L × ΔT 

0.05 = 11.0 × $10^{−6}$ × L × 30 

Therefore, the original length of the iron rail track (L) = 150909.09 cm or 1509.0909 m


Answer: 

The original length of the iron rail track was 1509.0909 cm or 1509.0909 m.
