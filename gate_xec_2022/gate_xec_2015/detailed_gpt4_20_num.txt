We can solve this problem using the Arrhenius equation, which relates the diffusion coefficient (D) to the temperature (T) and activation energy (Q) for a given material. The equation is:

D = D0 * exp(-Q / (R * T))

where:
D = diffusion coefficient (m^2s^(-1))
D0 = pre-exponential factor (m^2s^(-1))
Q = activation energy (J/mol)
R = gas constant (8.314 J/mol K)
T = temperature (K)

We are given values of D for two temperatures, 400 K and 500 K. We can use these data points to solve for the unknowns D0 and Q, and then find the temperature for the given value of D (10^(-16) m^2s^(-1)).

First, let's set up two equations using the given data points:

1) D_400 = D0 * exp(-Q / (R * 400))
where D_400 = 1.28 x 10^(-22) m^2s^(-1)

2) D_500 = D0 * exp(-Q / (R * 500))
where D_500 = 5.75 x 10^(-19) m^2s^(-1)

Now, let's divide equation (2) by equation (1) to eliminate the D0 term:

(D_500 / D_400) = exp(-Q / (R * 500)) / exp(-Q / (R * 400))

(5.75 x 10^(-19) / 1.28 x 10^(-22)) = exp((Q / (R * 400)) - (Q / (R * 500)))

4.4921875 x 10^3 = exp(Q * (1 / (R * 400) - 1 / (R * 500)))

Now, let's take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:

ln(4.4921875 x 10^3) = Q * (1 / (R * 400) - 1 / (R * 500))

Now we can solve for Q:

Q = ln(4.4921875 x 10^3) / (1 / (R * 400) - 1 / (R * 500))

Now let's plug in the value of R (8.314 J/mol K) to get Q:

Q ≈ 121732.2 J/mol

Now that we have the value of Q, let's plug it back into equation (1) to find D0:

D_400 = D0 * exp(-Q / (R * 400))

1.28 x 10^(-22) = D0 * exp(-121732.2 / (8.314 * 400))

Now, solve for D0:

D0 ≈ 2.936 x 10^(-11) m^2s^(-1)

Now we can use the Arrhenius equation with the given value of D (10^(-16) m^2s^(-1)) to find the temperature:

D = D0 * exp(-Q / (R * T))

10^(-16) = 2.936 x 10^(-11) * exp(-121732.2 / (8.314 * T))

Now, let's solve for T:

10^(-16) / 2.936 x 10^(-11) = exp(-121732.2 / (8.314 * T))

3.407 x 10^(-6) = exp(-121732.2 / (8.314 * T))

Now, take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:

ln(3.407 x 10^(-6)) = -121732.2 / (8.314 * T)

Now, solve for T:

T ≈ 587.97 K

So, the temperature at which the value of the diffusion coefficient is 10^(-16) m^2s^(-1) is approximately 588 K.

Therefore, the final answer is [588] (in Kelvin).
