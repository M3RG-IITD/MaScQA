We are given the diffusion coefficient at two different temperatures and are asked to find the temperature at which the diffusion coefficient has a certain value. We can use the Arrhenius equation to solve this problem:

D = $D_0exp(-Q/RT)$

where D is the diffusion coefficient, $D_0$ is the pre-exponential factor, Q is the activation energy, R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature.

To find the temperature at which D is $10^{-16}$ $m^2s^{-1}$, we need to set up two equations using the given diffusion coefficients and temperatures:

$10^{-16}$ = $D_{0} e^{\frac{-Q}{R(400)}}$

$5.75 x 10^{-19}$ = $D_{0} e^{\frac{-Q}{R(500)}}$

Dividing these two equations and solving for T:

$\frac{10^{-16}}{5.75 x 10^{-19}} = e^{\frac{Q}{R} (\frac{1}{400} - \frac{1}{500})}$

$T =$ $\frac{1}{\frac{1}{400} - \frac{1}{500}} = 909K$

Therefore, the temperature at which the diffusion coefficient is $10^{-16}$ $m^2s^{-1}$ is 909K. 

Final Answer: [909K]
