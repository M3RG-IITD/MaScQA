Let's analyze each option step by step:

(A) the potential energy of the solid is lowest

When the atoms in a solid are separated by their equilibrium distance, they are in their most stable state. In this stable state, the potential energy of the solid is at its lowest value because the forces of attraction and repulsion between the atoms are balanced. 

(B) the force of attraction between the atoms is maximum

This option is incorrect because when atoms are separated by their equilibrium distance, the forces of attraction and repulsion are balanced. The force of attraction is not at its maximum value. If the atoms were closer together, the force of attraction would increase, but it would be counterbalanced by a larger repulsive force.

(C) the force of repulsion between the atoms is zero

This option is also incorrect. When atoms are separated by their equilibrium distance, there is still a force of repulsion between them. The forces of attraction and repulsion are balanced, but neither force is zero.

(D) the potential energy of the solid is zero

This option is incorrect because the potential energy of a solid is never zero. When the atoms are at their equilibrium distance, the potential energy is at its lowest value, but it is not zero.

So, the correct answer is:

[A]
