To find the original length of the iron rail track, we can use the formula for linear expansion:

ΔL = L₀ * α * ΔT

where:
ΔL is the change in length (0.05 cm),
L₀ is the original length (which we want to find),
α is the linear thermal expansion coefficient (11.0 * $10^(-6)$ $K^(-1)$), and
ΔT is the change in temperature (45°C - 15°C = 30°C).

Rearranging the formula to solve for L₀, we get:

L₀ = ΔL / (α * ΔT)

Now, we can plug in the given values:

L₀ = 0.05 cm / [(11.0 * $10^(-6)$ $K^(-1)$) * 30°C]

L₀ ≈ 0.05 cm / (3.3 * $10^(-4)$)

L₀ ≈ 151.51 cm (approximately)

So, the original length of the iron rail track is approximately 151.51 cm.

Answer: [151.51]
