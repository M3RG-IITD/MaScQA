We can use the Beer-Lambert law to find the thickness of the germanium crystal layer. The formula is:

I = I0 * e^(-αt),

where I is the transmitted intensity, I0 is the incident intensity, α is the absorption coefficient, and t is the thickness of the material.

To find the thickness that would absorb 80% of the incident radiation, we can set I = 0.2 * I0, since 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

0.2 * I0 = I0 * e^(-αt),

Divide both sides by I0:

0.2 = e^(-αt).

Now we can take the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(0.2) = -αt.

Next, let's solve for t:

t = -ln(0.2) / α.

We are given the wavelength (1.3 µm) and the absorption coefficient (α) of germanium (3.3 * 10^5 m^(-1)). Let's plug these values into the formula:

t = - ln(0.2) / (3.3 * 10^5 m^(-1)).

t ≈ 2.90645 * 10^(-6) m.

To convert the thickness from meters to micrometers, we multiply by 10^6:

t ≈ 2.90645 * 10^(-6) m * 10^6 µm/m = 2.90645 µm.

The thickness of the germanium crystal layer required for absorbing 80% of the incident radiation is approximately 2.90645 µm.

Answer: [2.90645]
