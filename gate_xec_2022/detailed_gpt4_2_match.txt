Let's analyze each substance and determine its bonding type. 

P: $Cu_{0.5}Al_{0.5}$

Copper (Cu) and Aluminum (Al) are both metals. When two metals combine, they form metallic bonds. So, the bonding in this compound is metallic. 

Q: ZnS

Zinc (Zn) is a metal, and sulfur (S) is a non-metal. When a metal and a non-metal combine, they form ionic bonds. So, the bonding in ZnS is ionic.

R: $Na_2O$

Sodium (Na) is a metal, and oxygen (O) is a non-metal. When a metal and a non-metal combine, they form ionic bonds. So, the bonding in this compound is ionic.

S: $Li_4SiO_4$

Lithium (Li) is a metal, silicon (Si) is a metalloid, and oxygen (O) is a non-metal. This compound contains both ionic and covalent bonds, leading to a mixed bonding character. 

Now, let's match the materials to the bonding types.

P - Metallic
Q - Ionic
R - Ionic
S - Mixed

Therefore, the answer is:

P - 3; Q - 1; R - 1; S - 4

The matching answer is (C). So, the correct answer is:

[C]
