For a body-centered cubic crystal, there are two atoms contributed by each corner along the (110) plane, and one atom in the center of the unit cell. Each corner atom contributes only 1/4 of itself to the lattice, while the center atom contributes entirely to the lattice. Thus, the effective number of atoms in the (110) plane is:

(2 * 1/4) + 1 = 1/2 + 1 = 3/2

The area of the (110) plane can be calculated using the side length (a) of the cubic unit cell.

For (110) plane, we have
Area = a * a/√2 = a^2/√2

So, the number of atoms per unit area is:

(3/2) * (1 / (a^2/√2)) 

This simplifies to:

(3/2) * (√2 / a^2) = (3√2) / (2a^2)

Comparing this expression to the given options, there is no exact match. So, none of the given options are correct. However, the closest option is (B) √2/$a^2$. 

Therefore, the answer is: [None]
