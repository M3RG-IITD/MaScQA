To answer this question, we need to first understand the concept of Brinell hardness testing and the relationship between hardness and the level of strain experienced by a material.

Brinell hardness testing is a hardness measurement technique that gives information about the material's resistance to indentation. It involves pressing a hard, rigid sphere (typically a steel ball) into the sample material, and measuring the size of the indentation that results. The Brinell hardness number (BHN) is then calculated from the applied load and the area of the indentation.

Now, let's consider the two dog-bone samples in the question. Sample 1 was tested under tension to point E, and Sample 2 was tested under tension to point P. These points are not clearly defined in the question, but we should assume that point E corresponds to a higher tension/strain than point P since point E is mentioned after point P in the description.

When a material is subjected to tension, it experiences elastic deformation followed by plastic deformation. Elastic deformation is reversible meaning the material will return to its original shape once the stress is removed. Plastic deformation, on the other hand, is irreversible, and the material will not return to its original shape when the stress is removed. Plastic deformation is associated with an increase in dislocations within the material, which can also affect the hardness of the material.

Given that Sample 1 experiences a higher level of tension (i.e., higher strain) than Sample 2, it is reasonable to assume the material undergoes more plastic deformation in Sample 1. This would result in a higher degree of dislocations and a higher overall hardness for Sample 1 when compared to Sample 2.

Since Brinell hardness testing provides a measure of a material's resistance to indentation, it can be inferred that a higher degree of plastic deformation (and thus higher dislocation density) would lead to an increased hardness value. Therefore, we can conclude:

(A) BHN of 1 > BHN of 2
