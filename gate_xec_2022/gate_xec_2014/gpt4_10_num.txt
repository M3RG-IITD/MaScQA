To determine the degree of polymerization, we need to know the molecular weight of the monomer, in this case, butadiene. 

Butadiene has the chemical formula C4H6, so its molecular weight is:
(4 * 12.01) + (6 * 1.01) = 48.04 + 6.06 = 54.1 g/mol.

Now, we can calculate the degree of polymerization using the formula:
Degree of polymerization = (Molecular weight of polymer) / (Molecular weight of monomer)

Degree of polymerization = (3 * 10^5) / 54.1 â‰ˆ 5547

So, the degree of polymerization is approximately [5547].
