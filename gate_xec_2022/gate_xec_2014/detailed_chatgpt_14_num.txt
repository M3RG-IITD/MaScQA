We can use the rule of mixtures to solve for the volume fraction of fibers in the composite:

E_composite = V_fiber * E_fiber + V_matrix * E_matrix 

where:
- E_composite is the Young's modulus of the composite
- V_fiber is the volume fraction of fibers
- E_fiber is the Young's modulus of the fiber (SiC)
- V_matrix is the volume fraction of matrix (Ti)
- E_matrix is the Young's modulus of the matrix (Ti)

We are given:
- E_composite = 185 GPa
- E_fiber = 360 GPa
- E_matrix = 110 GPa

Substituting these values, we get:

185 GPa = V_fiber * 360 GPa + V_matrix * 110 GPa

We also know that the volume fractions of fibers and matrix add up to 1:

V_fiber + V_matrix = 1

We can use this expression to solve for one of the volume fractions in terms of the other:

V_matrix = 1 - V_fiber

Substituting this into the first equation, we get:

185 GPa = V_fiber * 360 GPa + (1 - V_fiber) * 110 GPa

Simplifying this equation, we get:

185 GPa = 250 GPa * V_fiber + 110 GPa

75 GPa = 250 GPa * V_fiber

V_fiber = 0.3 or 30%

Therefore, the volume fraction of fibers in the composite is 30%.

Answer:
- 30%
