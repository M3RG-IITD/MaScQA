To solve this problem, we can use the formula:

m1c1(Tf - Ti) + m2c2(Tf - Ti) = 0

where
m1 = mass of copper cup
c1 = specific heat of copper
Ti = initial temperature of the cup
m2 = mass of water
c2 = specific heat of water
Tf = final temperature

First, let's calculate the initial temperature of the cup and the water. Since the water is at 4°C, we assume the cup is also at 4°C.

Now we can apply the formula:

(140 g)(0.385 J/g°C)(Tf - 4°C) + (80 g)(4.18 J/g°C)(Tf - 4°C) + (100 g)(4.18 J/g°C)(90°C - Tf) = 0

Simplifying and solving for Tf, we get:

Tf = 18.5°C

Therefore, the final temperature of the water is 18.5°C.

Answer: [18.5°C]
