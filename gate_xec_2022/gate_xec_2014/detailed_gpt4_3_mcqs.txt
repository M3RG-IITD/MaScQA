To solve this question, we need to understand what Barrier Potential for a silicon p-n junction actually means.

When we talk about semiconductor materials like silicon or germanium, a p-n junction is formed when a p-type material (where conduction is due to positive charge carriers called holes) and n-type material (where conduction is due to negative charge carriers called electrons) are put together. There is a layer in this p-n junction region where there is a recombination of electrons and holes which causes a depletion zone. This depletion zone maintains an electric field within the junction.

Now, Barrier potential is the Voltage required to overcome the electric field present in this junction so that there is a flow of electric current through the junction. In simple terms, it's the voltage required to push electrons from N-side to P-side across the junction.

Coming back to the problem, we have to find the barrier potential for silicon p-n junction in Volt (V). There are given four options: (A) 0.7 * $10^(-23)$ (B) 0.07 (C) 0.70 (D) 7.0

The correct value of barrier potential for silicon p-n junction is around 0.7V. (This is a standard known value for silicon p-n junctions at room temperature)

So, the correct answer is (C) 0.70

Therefore, the answer is [0.70].
