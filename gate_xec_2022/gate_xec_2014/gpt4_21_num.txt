To calculate the diffraction angle, we can use the Bragg's Law:

n * λ = 2 * d * sinθ

Where,
n = order of reflection (1 for first order)
λ = wavelength of radiation (0.1542 nm)
d = interplanar spacing for (113) set of planes
θ = diffraction angle (which we need to find)

First, let's find the interplanar spacing (d) for the (113) set of planes using the formula:

d = a / √(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)

where a is the lattice parameter (0.392 nm) and (h, k, l) are the Miller indices of the plane (1, 1, 3).

d = 0.392 / √(1^2 + 1^2 + 3^2)
d = 0.392 / √11
d ≈ 0.118 nm

Now, let's use Bragg's Law to find the diffraction angle:

1 * 0.1542 = 2 * 0.118 * sinθ

sinθ = 0.1542 / (2 * 0.118)
sinθ ≈ 0.6538

To find the angle (θ), we take the inverse sine (arcsin) of sinθ:

θ = arcsin(0.6538)
θ ≈ 40.64 degrees

So the expected diffraction angle for the first order reflection is approximately 40.64 degrees. The answer is:

[40.64]
