To determine the mechanical energy needed to break the material, we can find the area under the stress-strain curve, which represents the mechanical work done on the material. Since the material does not exhibit any strain hardening, the stress-strain curve is a straight line from (0, 0) to (0.108, 880 MPa).

The area under the stress-strain curve can be represented as a triangle with base (strain) = 0.108 and height (stress) = 880 MPa.

Area = (1/2) * base * height
Area = (1/2) * 0.108 * 880 * 10^6 N/m^2

Now, we need to convert the energy to MJ/m^3:
Area = (0.5 * 0.108 * 880 * 10^6) * (1 * 10^-6 MJ/Nm^2)
Area = 47.52 MJ/m^3

The mechanical energy that is necessary to break the material is 47.52 MJ/m^3.

Answer: [47.52]
