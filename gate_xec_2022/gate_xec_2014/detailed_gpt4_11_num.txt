To find the mechanical energy required to break the material, we can use the following formula:

Mechanical Energy = (Stress × Strain) / 2

Step 1: Convert the given data into the same units
Young's modulus (E) = 110 GPa = 110 * 10^9 Pa
Yield strength (σ) = 880 MPa = 880 * 10^6 Pa
Strain (ε) = 0.108 (dimensionless)

Step 2: Find stress
Since the alloy does not exhibit any strain hardening, the stress at which it fails remains constant and equal to the yield strength.
So, stress = 880 * 10^6 Pa 

Step 3: Calculate the mechanical energy
Mechanical energy = (Stress × Strain) / 2
= (880 * 10^6 Pa × 0.108) / 2
= 47,520,000,000 J/m³

Step 4: Convert the mechanical energy into MJ/m³
Mechanical energy = 47,520,000,000 J/m³ * (1 MJ / 10^6 J)
= 47.52 MJ/m³

The mechanical energy that is necessary to break the material is 47.52 MJ/m³.

Answer: [47.52]
