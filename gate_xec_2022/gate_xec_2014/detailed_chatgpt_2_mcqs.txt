Nylon-6 is a polyamide that is produced from caprolactam monomer. Let us break down each option to understand this better.

(A) Caprolactum: This is the correct option as stated above.

(B) Adipic acid and hexamethylene diamine: This combination is used to produce Nylon-6,6 instead of Nylon-6. Nylon-6,6 is made up of six carbon atoms in the hexamethylene diamine molecule and six carbon atoms in the adipic acid molecule. The name '6,6' is derived from this. 

(C) Maleic anhydride and hexamethylene diamine: This combination is used to produce Nylon-6-12. In this case, the diamine has 6 carbon atoms and the diacid has 12 carbon atoms.

(D) Sebasic acid and hexamethylene diamine: This combination is used to produce Nylon-6,10. In this case, the diamine has 6 carbon atoms and the diacid has 10 carbon atoms.

Therefore, the answer is: 

- (A) caprolactam
