We can use Bragg's law to solve this problem:

n * λ = 2d sin(θ)

where n is the order of reflection, λ is the wavelength of the radiation, d is the spacing between the planes, and θ is the angle of diffraction.

We need to find d for the (113) planes of FCC Pt. We can use the formula:

d = a / sqrt(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)

where a is the lattice parameter, and h, k, l are the Miller indices for the set of planes.

For (113) planes, h = 1, k = 1, and l = 3. Plugging in the values:

d = 0.392 nm / sqrt(1^2 + 1^2 + 3^2) = 0.146 nm

Now we can use Bragg's law to find θ:

1 * 0.1542 nm = 2 * 0.146 nm * sin(θ)

sin(θ) = 0.2657

θ = 15.33 degrees

Therefore, the expected diffraction angle for the first order reflection from the (113) set of planes for FCC Pt using monochromatic radiation of wavelength 0.1542 nm is 15.33 degrees.
