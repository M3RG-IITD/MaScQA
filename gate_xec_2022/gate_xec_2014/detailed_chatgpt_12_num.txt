To solve this problem, we need to use the principle of conservation of energy, which states that the total energy in a closed system is conserved. In this case, the closed system is the copper cup containing water.

Step 1: Calculate the heat absorbed by the copper cup when it is filled with the initial quantity of water.

The heat absorbed by the copper cup can be calculated using the formula:

Q = mcΔT

where Q is the heat absorbed, m is the mass of the copper cup, c is the specific heat of copper, and ΔT is the change in temperature.

We know that the copper cup weighing 140 g has a specific heat of 0.385 J/g °C. Since the cup does not undergo a change in temperature, we can assume that ΔT = 0. Therefore, the heat absorbed by the copper cup is:

Qc = mcΔT = 140 g × 0.385 J/g °C × 0 °C = 0 J

Step 2: Calculate the heat absorbed by the water when it is poured into the copper cup.

The heat absorbed by the water can be calculated using the formula:

Q = mcΔT

where Q is the heat absorbed, m is the mass of the water, and c is the specific heat of water.

We know that the initial quantity of water is 80 g and its initial temperature is 4 °C. Therefore, the heat absorbed by the water is:

Qw1 = mw1cΔT = 80 g × 4.18 J/g °C × (Tf - 4 °C)

where Tf is the final temperature of the water.

Step 3: Calculate the heat absorbed by the copper cup when the water is poured into it.

The heat absorbed by the copper cup can be calculated using the same formula as in step 1:

Qc = mcΔT

where Qc is the heat absorbed, m is the mass of the copper cup, and c is the specific heat of copper.

We know that the initial temperature of the copper cup is room temperature, which is 25 °C. Therefore, the heat absorbed by the copper cup when the water is poured into it is:

Qc1 = mcΔT = 140 g × 0.385 J/g °C × (Tf - 25 °C)

Step 4: Calculate the heat absorbed by the water when 100 g of water at 90 °C is added to the cup.

The heat absorbed by the water can be calculated using the same formula as in step 2:

Qw2 = mw2cΔT = 100 g × 4.18 J/g °C × (Tf - 90 °C)

where mw2 is the mass of the second quantity of water, which is 100 g at a temperature of 90 °C.

Step 5: Equate the total heat absorbed to the total heat lost.

Since the system is closed, the total heat absorbed must be equal to the total heat lost. Therefore, we can write:

Qw1 + Qc1 + Qw2 = 0

Substituting the formulas from steps 2, 3, and 4, we get:

80 g × 4.18 J/g °C × (Tf - 4 °C) + 140 g × 0.385 J/g °C × (Tf - 25 °C) + 100 g × 4.18 J/g °C × (Tf - 90 °C) = 0

Simplifying this equation gives:

334.4 Tf - 1337.6 + 54.25 Tf - 963.5 + 418 Tf - 37620 = 0

808.65 Tf = 39820.1

Tf = 49.21 °C

Therefore, the final temperature of the water in the copper cup is 49.21 °C.
