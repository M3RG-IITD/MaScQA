The mechanical properties of a material are affected by a number of factors, including the presence of dislocations within the material. Dislocations are defects or irregularities in the crystal structure of a material that can affect its mechanical properties. The mobile dislocation density, which refers to the number of moving or active dislocations within the material, is one factor that can affect several mechanical properties. 

(P) Young’s modulus: Young’s modulus is a measure of a material’s stiffness or resistance to deformation. It is defined as the ratio of stress to strain in a material under tension or compression. The Young’s modulus of a material is determined in part by the strength of the atomic bonds within the material and the spacing between atoms. The presence of dislocations within a material can affect the spacing between atoms and thus the Young’s modulus. However, the mobile dislocation density is not the primary factor affecting the Young’s modulus, and there are other factors such as temperature and the material’s microstructure that can also affect this property. 

(Q) Yield strength: Yield strength is the amount of stress that a material can withstand before it begins to deform permanently. It is a measure of a material’s ability to resist plastic deformation. Dislocations play a key role in plastic deformation, and the mobile dislocation density is a primary factor affecting yield strength. When a material is subjected to stress, dislocations can move and interact within the crystal structure, causing plastic deformation. A higher mobile dislocation density means that there are more dislocations available to move and interact, which can increase the yield strength of the material. 

(R) Ductility: Ductility is a measure of a material’s ability to deform plastically without breaking. Materials that are ductile can be drawn out into thin wires or stretched into thin sheets without breaking. Dislocations play a key role in ductility, and the mobile dislocation density is a primary factor affecting this property. When a material is subjected to stress, dislocations can move and interact to allow for plastic deformation. A higher mobile dislocation density means that there are more dislocations available to move and interact, which can increase the ductility of the material. 

(S) Fracture toughness: Fracture toughness is a measure of a material’s resistance to crack propagation. It is a measure of the energy required to propagate a crack through a material. Dislocations can affect fracture toughness in several ways, such as by introducing stress concentrations that can promote crack formation or by interacting with the crack tip to promote crack growth. However, the relationship between mobile dislocation density and fracture toughness is not as straightforward as for yield strength and ductility, and there are other factors such as the material’s microstructure and the orientation of the crack with respect to the crystal structure that can also affect this property. 

Based on this analysis, the mechanical properties that depend on the mobile dislocation density in a material are: 
- Yield strength 
- Ductility 

Therefore, the answer is (B) Q, R, S.
