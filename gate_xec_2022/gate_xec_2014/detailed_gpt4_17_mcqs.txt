1. First, we need to find the energy difference between the n = 4 state and the n = 2 state in a hydrogen atom, which represents the energy of the photon emitted. We use the formula for the energy of a hydrogen atom electron:

En = -13.6eV * (1/n²)

where En is the energy, and n is the principal quantum number.

2. Calculate the energy of the n = 4 state:

E4 = -13.6 * (1/4²) = -13.6 * (1/16) = -0.85 eV

3. Calculate the energy of the n = 2 state:

E2 = -13.6 * (1/2²) = -13.6 * (1/4) = -3.4 eV

4. Calculate the energy difference between the n = 4 state and the n = 2 state:

Energy difference = E2 - E4 = -3.4 - (-0.85) = -3.4 + 0.85 = -2.55 eV

5. Next, we need to find the wavelength of the emitted photon. We can use the formula:

E = (hc)/λ

where E is the energy of the photon, h is Planck's constant (4.1357 × 10⁻¹⁵ eV·s), c is the speed of light (3 × 10⁸ m/s), and λ is the wavelength of the emitted photon.

6. Rearrange the formula to solve for the wavelength:

λ = (hc)/E

7. Now, plug in the values to find the wavelength:

λ = (4.1357 × 10⁻¹⁵ eV·s × 3 × 10⁸ m/s) / 2.55 eV

λ = (1.2407 × 10⁻⁶ eV·m) / 2.55 eV

λ = 4.866 × 10⁻⁷ m

8. Convert the wavelength from meters to micrometers (μm):

λ = 4.866 × 10⁻⁷ m × (10⁶ μm/m) = 0.487 μm

9. Check which option best matches our calculations:

(A) 3.0, 0.413 
(B) 2.55, 0.365 
(C) 2.75, 0.451 
(D) 2.55, 0.487

From our calculations, we find that the correct answer is (D) 2.55, 0.487.

So, the final answer is:

[(D) 2.55, 0.487]
