A two-phase (α + β) mixture of an A-B binary system has the following properties: (i) Phase α has equal weight percentages of A and B. (ii) Phase β has twice the mole fraction of A compared to B. (iii) The two-phase mixture has equal amounts of α and β. (iv) Atomic mass of A is twice that of B. The mole fraction of A in the resultant two-phase mixture is? (Round off to one decimal)
