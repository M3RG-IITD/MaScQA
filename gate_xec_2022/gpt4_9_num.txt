We are given the following standard reduction potentials:

E°($Li^+$/Li) = -3.04 V
E°($Zn^{2+}$/Zn) = -0.77 V

We are also given that the electrochemical reaction occurs at +4.50 V against a $Li^+$/Li reference electrode. To find the potential of the same reaction against a $Zn^{2+}$/Zn reference electrode, we can use the Nernst equation, which relates the potentials:

E_cell(reaction) = E°(reaction) - E°(reference)

First, let's find the E°(reaction):

E°(reaction) = E_cell(reaction) + E°(reference)

Against $Li^+$/Li reference electrode:

E°(reaction) = 4.50 V + (-3.04 V)
E°(reaction) = 1.46 V

Now we can find the potential of the same reaction against a $Zn^{2+}$/Zn reference electrode:

E_cell(reaction) = E°(reaction) - E°(reference)

Against $Zn^{2+}$/Zn reference electrode:

E_cell(reaction) = 1.46 V - (-0.77 V)
E_cell(reaction) = 1.46 V + 0.77 V
E_cell(reaction) = 2.23 V

Therefore, the potential of the same reaction against a $Zn^{2+}$/Zn reference electrode is 2.23 V.

Answer: [2.23]
