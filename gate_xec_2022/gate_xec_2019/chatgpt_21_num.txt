Given,
Young's modulus (E) = 72 GPa = 72,000 MPa
Change in polarization (dp) = 645 - 640 = 5 Cm^-3 = 5 * 10^-12 m^-2.

The stress required to change polarization can be found using the following formula:
dp = (e * stress) / (epsilon * (1 - 2 * mu))
where 
e = permittivity of free space = 8.854 * 10^-12 F/m
epsilon = permittivity of the material
mu = Poisson's ratio = 0.34 (approximate value for most piezoelectric materials)

Rearranging the above formula, we get:
stress = (dp * epsilon * (1 - 2*mu)) / e

Now, we need to find the value of epsilon, which can be calculated using the following formula:
epsilon = (permittivity * area) / distance
where
area = 1 m^2 (assuming a unit area)
distance = thickness of the material which is not given in the question
permittivity = capacitance / (area * distance * voltage)
The value of capacitance and voltage are not given in the question, so we cannot calculate permittivity or epsilon.

Therefore, the answer cannot be calculated with the given information. 

Answer: cannot be determined.
