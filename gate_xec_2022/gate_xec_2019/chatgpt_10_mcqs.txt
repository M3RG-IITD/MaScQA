Number-average molecular weight, $\overline{M_n}=\frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^Nw_iM_i}{\sum\limits_{i=1}^Nw_i}$

Degree of polymerization, $n=\frac{\overline{M_n}}{M_0}$ 

Here, $\overline{M_n}=10^5$ g/mol and $n=2210$ 

Assuming that there are only two repeat units in the copolymer, let the molecular weight of the repeat unit containing ethylene be $x$ and the molecular weight of the other repeat unit be $y$. 

Thus, $\overline{M_n}=x+y=10^5$ 

Also, $n=\frac{\overline{M_n}}{M_0}=\frac{x+y}{x_0+y_0}=2210$ 

Solving for $y$, we get:

$y=y_0\frac{2210x_0+2210y_0-x_0y_0}{2210y_0-x_0y_0}$

We know that $y_0$ is the molecular weight of the repeat unit containing ethylene minus the molecular weight of ethylene itself, which is 28 g/mol. 

We also know that the molecular weight of the repeat unit containing ethylene and $y$ is given by:

$x+y=10^5$

Substituting the value of $y_0$ and simplifying, we get:

$y=\frac{28(2210x_0-10^5)}{x_0-2210}$

We can now substitute the molecular weights of the given repeat units one by one and see which one satisfies the above equation. 

(A) $−CH_2−CH(CH_3)−$: For this repeat unit, $x_0=56$ and substituting this in the above equation, we get:

$y=-7$$\text{8}$ , which is not possible, as molecular weights cannot be negative. 

(B) $−CH_2−CHCl−$: For this repeat unit, $x_0=62.5$ and substituting this in the above equation, we get:

$y=175$, which is a valid molecular weight. 

(C) $−CF_2−CF_2−$: For this repeat unit, $x_0=100$ and substituting this in the above equation, we get:

$y=4.4\times 10^6$, which is not possible, as molecular weights cannot be this high for a single repeat unit. 

(D) $−CH_2−CH(C_6H_5)−$: For this repeat unit, $x_0=106$ and substituting this in the above equation, we get:

$y=2.6\times 10^5$, which is also not a possible molecular weight for a single repeat unit. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) $−CH_2−CHCl−$. 

Answer: 

(B) $−CH_2−CHCl−$
