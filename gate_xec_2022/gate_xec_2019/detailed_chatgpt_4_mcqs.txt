Time-independent deformation is also known as elastic deformation, which means the material regains its original shape after the removal of the applied stress. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Elastic deformation. 

Let's take a look at the other options to understand why they are time-dependent:

(B) Anelastic deformation: This type of deformation occurs when a material undergoes stress and strain, where a portion of the deformation persists even after the stress is removed, similar to plastic deformation. 

(C) Viscoelastic deformation: It is a time-dependent deformation that combines the characteristics of both elastic and viscous materials. The response of such a material to stress depends on the rate of deformation or the time it takes.

(D) Creep deformation: This type of deformation occurs over an extended period, and the material continues to deform over time or under the constant application of stress. 

Therefore, the answer is (A) Elastic deformation.
