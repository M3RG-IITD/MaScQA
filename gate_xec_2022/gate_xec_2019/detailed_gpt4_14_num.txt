To determine the partial pressure of hydrogen required to stop the corrosion of nickel, we need to use the Nernst equation.

The Nernst equation relates the reduction potential of a half-cell at any point in time to the standard reduction potential, temperature, and concentrations of the species participating in the redox reaction. It is given by:

E = E° - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)

Where:
E = reduction potential at any point
E° = standard reduction potential
R = universal gas constant (8.314 J K^(−1) mol^(−1))
T = temperature (298 K in this case)
n = number of electrons transferred in the redox reaction
F = Faraday's constant (96500 C mol^(−1))
Q = reaction quotient, which is the ratio of the concentrations of products and reactants

The balanced redox reaction for the corrosion of nickel in the presence of hydrogen ions and nickel chloride is:

Ni (s) + 2H+ (aq) → Ni2+ (aq)+ H2 (g)

The standard reduction potentials for hydrogen ion (H+) and nickel (Ni) are 0.00 V and -0.25 V, respectively.

To find the potential difference between the nickel half-cell and hydrogen half-cell, we will use the Nernst equation. Since we want to stop corrosion, the potential difference between these half-cells (E) should be 0 V. 

0 = -0.25 - (8.314 * 298 / (2 * 96500)) * ln([Ni2+]/[H+]^2)

We are given the concentration of nickel chloride as 0.06 M. Assuming complete dissociation, the concentration of Ni2+ ions will be the same, 0.06 M. The pH of the solution is given as 4, so the concentration of H+ ions will be 10^(-4) M.

Plug in these concentrations and simplify:

0 = -0.25 - (8.314 * 298 / (2 * 96500)) * ln((0.06) / (10^(-4))^2)
0 = -0.25 - (8.314 * 298 / (2 * 96500)) * ln(6 * 10^5)

Now, let's solve for the partial pressure of hydrogen (P(H2)):

8.314 * 298 * ln(6 * 10^5) = 0.25 * 2 * 96500
ln(6 * 10^5) = (0.25 * 2 * 96500) / (8.314 * 298)
ln(6 * 10^5) ≈ 7.0

Exponentiate both sides:

6 * 10^5 = e^7.0

Now, we can find the partial pressure of hydrogen:

P(H2) = (6 * 10^5) * (10^(-4)^2)
P(H2) ≈ 60 atm

Thus, the partial pressure of hydrogen required to stop the corrosion of nickel is approximately 60 atm (rounded to the nearest integer). The correct answer is [60].
