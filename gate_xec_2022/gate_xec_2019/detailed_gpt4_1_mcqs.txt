To answer this question, let's first understand the terms and concepts involved.

1. Objective Aperture: The objective aperture is an opening in the microscope's objective lens that allows light to pass through. The size of the aperture affects the performance of the microscope in various ways.

2. Spherical Aberration: Spherical aberration occurs when light rays entering the lens at different distances from the lens axis are focused at different points along the axis. This results in a blurry image.

3. Depth of Field: The depth of field is the distance between the nearest and farthest objects that appear in focus in the microscope image.

4. Diffraction-limited Resolution: The diffraction-limited resolution is the smallest distance between two points that can be distinguished in a microscope image, determined by the diffraction of light by the optical system. In general, the smaller the aperture, the lower the resolution, due to increased diffraction.

5. Astigmatism: Astigmatism is a type of optical error that occurs when the lens focuses light at different points along two perpendicular planes. This causes the image to be stretched or distorted in one direction and can worsen with a decrease in aperture size.

Now, let's evaluate each statement against our understanding of these concepts:

(A) The spherical aberration increases when the objective aperture size decreases.

Explanation: Spherical aberration is influenced by the shape and quality of the lens, rather than the aperture size. So, the aperture size does not directly affect the spherical aberration.

(B) The depth of field increases when the objective aperture size decreases.

Explanation: Depth of field is directly proportional to the size of the aperture. As the aperture size decreases, the depth of field increases. This is because a smaller aperture lets in less light, which means that the image will have a larger area in focus.

(C) The diffraction-limited resolution increases when the objective aperture size decreases.

Explanation: Diffraction-limited resolution is inversely proportional to the aperture size. As the aperture size decreases, diffraction becomes more significant, and the resolution decreases. Thus, the statement is incorrect.

(D) The astigmatism increases when the objective aperture size decreases.

Explanation: Astigmatism is influenced by the shape and quality of the lens and can be affected by the aperture size. A smaller aperture can make the distortion caused by astigmatism more significant, so it can increase when the aperture size decreases.

So, based on the analysis above:

Answer: [B, D].
