As per Bragg's law,

nλ = 2dsinθ

where n is the order of reflection, λ is the wavelength of incident radiation, d is the spacing between planes, and θ is the angle of incidence or diffraction.

Here, the incident beam is monochromatic X-ray with wavelength λ = 0.154 nm, and the crystal has a cubic structure with lattice parameter a = 0.245 nm. The schematic diagram shows that the set of planes is represented by the vector (1,1,0), which has a distance of d = a/√2 between adjacent planes.

So,

d = a/√2 = 0.245 nm/√2 ≈ 0.173 nm

Plugging in the given values in the Bragg's equation, we get

λ/2d = sinθ

θ = sin⁻¹(λ/2d) = sin⁻¹(0.154/2*0.173) ≈ 20.2°

Therefore, the diffraction angle for the first order reflection is 2θ ≈ 40.4°.

Answer: [40.4]
