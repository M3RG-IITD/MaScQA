(Given: Standard reduction potential of nickel = ̶ 0.25 V, Faraday’s constant = 96500 C $mol^(−1)$, Universal gas constant = 8.314 J $K^(−1)mol^(−1)$). Nickel corrodes at 298 K in a solution of 0.06 M nickel chloride having pH 4. Assuming complete dissociation of nickel chloride, the partial pressure(in atm) of hydrogen required to stop the corrosion of nickel is? (round off to the nearest integer)
