To find the stress required to change the polarization, we can use the formula:

Stress = (Change in polarization) / (Young’s modulus)

First, we need to convert the Young's modulus from GPa to MPa:

72 GPa = 72 × 10^3 MPa

Now, we can calculate the stress:

Stress = (645 - 640) C m^(-3)/ (72 × 10^3 MPa)
Stress = 5 C m^(-3) / (72 × 10^3 MPa)

Since 1 C m^(-3) equals 1 N m^(-2), we can rewrite the stress equation as:

Stress = 5 N m^(-2) / (72 × 10^3 MPa)

To find the stress in MPa, we can convert N m^(-2) to MPa:

1 N m^(-2) = 1 × 10^(-6) MPa

So, the stress equation becomes:

Stress = 5 × 10^(-6) MPa / (72 × 10^3 MPa)

Stress = 5 / (72 × 10^3) MPa

Stress ≈ 6.944 × 10^(-5) MPa

Rounded off to the nearest integer, the stress required to change the polarization is 0 MPa.
