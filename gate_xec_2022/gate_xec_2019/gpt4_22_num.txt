We have a solenoid with a length L = 0.25 m, turns N = 150, and coercivity Hc = 7000 A/m. We want to find the current I required to generate the necessary magnetic field to demagnetize the iron bar magnet.

The magnetic field inside a solenoid can be calculated using the formula:

B = μ₀ * (N / L) * I

Where B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π * 10^(-7) Tm/A), N is the number of turns, L is the length of the solenoid, and I is the current.

To demagnetize the iron bar, we need to generate a magnetic field equal to or greater than its coercivity, Hc. The relationship between the magnetic field and the coercivity is:

B = μ₀ * Hc

Now we can equate the two expressions for B to solve for I:

μ₀ * (N / L) * I = μ₀ * Hc

We can remove μ₀ from both sides:

(N / L) * I = Hc

Now we can solve for I:

I = Hc * (L / N)

Substitute the given values of Hc, L, and N:

I = 7000 A/m * (0.25 m / 150)

I ≈ 11.67 A

Rounded to one decimal place, the required current to generate the necessary magnetic field to demagnetize the iron bar magnet is 11.7 A.

So, the correct answer is: [11.7].
