To find the diffraction angle (2θ) for the first order reflection, we can use Bragg's Law:

nλ = 2d * sin(θ)

where:
n = the order of the reflection (in this case, n = 1)
λ = the wavelength of the X-rays (λ = 0.154 nm)
d = the interplanar spacing (which we need to find)
θ = the angle between the incident X-ray beam and the lattice planes

For cubic crystals, the lattice parameter "a" is the same along all three dimensions. Since we are considering a schematic plane (1,1,1), we can calculate the interplanar spacing d using the formula:

d = a / √(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)

where h, k, and l are the Miller indices of the plane. In this case, h = k = l = 1, so:

d = 0.245 nm / √(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2)
d ≈ 0.245 nm / √3
d ≈ 0.141 nm

Now, we can plug the values back into Bragg's Law to find the angle θ:

(1)(0.154 nm) = 2(0.141 nm) * sin(θ)

sin(θ) ≈ 0.154 nm / (2 * 0.141 nm)
sin(θ) ≈ 0.546
θ ≈ arcsin(0.546)
θ ≈ 33.4 degrees

Finally, we need the diffraction angle 2θ, so:

2θ = 2 * 33.4 degrees
2θ = 66.8 degrees

Therefore, the diffraction angle (2θ) for the first order reflection from a set of planes represented by the schematic plane in the image is approximately 66.8 degrees.
