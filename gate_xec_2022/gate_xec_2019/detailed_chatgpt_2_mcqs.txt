The Pilling-Bedworth ratio (PBR) is defined as the ratio of the atomic radius of a metal cation to the effective ionic radius of its oxide ion. If the PBR is less than one, the oxide will rapidly grow and spall off, whereas if the PBR is greater than one, the oxide will adhere tightly to the metal surface and provide protection against further oxidation.

In this case, we need to determine which metal has the highest PBR value, indicating the most protection against oxidation. 

The PBR values for the given metals are as follows:

(A) Li: PBR = 0.59
(B) Ce: PBR = 1.44
(C) Ta: PBR = 1.20
(D) W: PBR = 1.04

Based on these values, we can see that the metal with the highest PBR value is Ce, with a PBR of 1.44. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Ce.
