Firstly, let's recall some important definitions:

1. Number-Average Molecular Weight (Mn): It's the average molecular weight of a polymer, considering the number of representative molecules. It can be calculated as the total weight of all the polymer chains divided by the total number of molecules in the sample.
2. Degree of Polymerization (DP): It's the average number of repeat units (monomer units) per polymer chain.

Now, we're given that the number-averaged molecular weight (Mn) is $10^5 g/mol$ and the degree of polymerization (DP) is 2210.

We are asked to find the structure of the other repeat unit, given that one of the repeat units is ethylene [which has the structure $-CH_2-CH_2-$].

Let's denote the given monomer units by A ($-CH_2-CH_2-$) and B (unknown). Since it's an alternating copolymer, the repeat unit would look like:

$- [A-B] -$

Now, we'll use the given information about the copolymer to find the molecular weight of the other repeat unit monomer B.

The formula we'll use is:

$$M_n = DP \times M_r$$

Where $M_n$ is the number-average molecular weight, DP is the degree of polymerization and $M_r$ is the average molecular weight of the repeat unit.

Since there are equal amounts of A and B in the copolymer, the DP for each A and B is also equal. So, the DP for A and B is $2210/2 = 1105$ for each.

Now, let's calculate the molecular weight of the ethylene repeat unit (A):

$$M_A = (2 \times 12) + (4 \times 1) = 24 + 4 = 28g/mol$$

The molecular weight of the repeat unit for the copolymer can be calculated as:

$$M_r = M_A + M_B$$

Hence, our equation becomes:

$$M_n = DP \times (M_A + M_B)$$

Now, we can rewrite the equation with the given values:

$$10^5 = 2210 \times (28 + M_B)$$

Now, we'll solve the equation for $M_B$:

$$M_B= \frac{10^5}{2210} - 28 $$

$$M_B= \frac{10^5}{2210} - 28\approx 17.19$$

Now, we need to find which repeat unit from the given options has a molecular weight close to 17.19 g/mol:

(A) $−CH_2−CH(CH_3)−$:  The molecular weight is: $(3 \times 12) + (6 \times 1) = 36 + 6 = 42g/mol$

(B) $−CH_2−CHCl−$: The molecular weight is: $(2 \times 12) + (3 \times 1) + 35.5 = 24 + 3 + 35.5 = \bold{62.5 g/mol}$

(C) $−CF_2−CF_2−$: The molecular weight is: $(4 \times 19) = 76g/mol$

(D) $−CH_2−CH(C_6H_5)−$: The molecular weight is: $(7 \times 12) + (7 \times 1) = 84 + 7 = 91g/mol$

From the given options, the one with the molecular weight closest to 17.19 g/mol is option (B): $−CH_2−CHCl−$.

Therefore, the structure of the other repeat unit in the alternating copolymer is option (B).

Answer: [B].
