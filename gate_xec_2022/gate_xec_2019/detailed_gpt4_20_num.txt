Let's first take a look at the information provided:

Initial Stress (S_i): 17 MPa
Stress after 100 hours (S_100): 16.6 MPa
Critical Stress (S_c): 14.5 MPa

We know that the stress decreases over time, and we want to find out the life of the assembly, in other words, how long it takes for the stress to reach the critical stress of 14.5 MPa.

To do this, we need to find a relationship between stress and time, and then find the time when the stress reaches the critical value.

Since we don't have an explicit equation for stress as a function of time, we can use the two given points (initial stress at 0 hours and stress after 100 hours) to find a linear equation of the form: 

S(t) = At + B

Here, t is the time in hours, and A and B are constants. Let's find the constants using the given data points:

1) Initial Stress (at t=0): S_i = 17 MPa
S(0) = A * 0 + B
17 = B

2) Stress after 100 hours: S_100 = 16.6 MPa
S(100) = A * 100 + B
16.6 = 100A + 17

Now, let's solve this system of linear equations to find A and B:

Substitute B = 17 into the second equation:

16.6 = 100A + 17

100A = -0.4
A = -0.004

Now we have found the equation of stress as a function of time:

S(t) = -0.004t + 17

To find the expected life of the assembly, we need to find at what time the stress reaches the critical value of 14.5 MPa:

14.5 = -0.004t + 17

0.004t = 17 - 14.5
0.004t = 2.5
t = 625

So, the expected life of the assembly is 625 hours. Since we need to round off to the nearest integer, the final answer will be:

[625]
