To determine the glass transition temperature (Tg) of a polymer, we need a technique that can measure changes in thermal or mechanical properties as a function of temperature. Let's evaluate each technique:

(A) Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA):
TGA is a technique that measures the change in mass of a sample as a function of temperature or time under controlled atmosphere. It's mainly used to study the thermal stability, decomposition, and degradation of materials. However, TGA doesn't directly measure Tg.

(B) Raman spectroscopy:
Raman spectroscopy is a technique used to observe vibrational, rotational, and other low-frequency modes in a molecular system. It can provide important information about chemical composition, molecular structure, and interactions. While Raman spectroscopy can provide qualitative information about the glass transition, it is not a direct method to determine Tg.

(C) NMR spectroscopy:
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a technique that uses the absorption of electromagnetic radiation to study the magnetic properties of atomic nuclei. Although NMR can provide information about the molecular structure and dynamics in polymers, it's not typically employed to determine Tg directly.

(D) Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC):
DSC measures the difference in heat flow between a sample and a reference as a function of temperature while both are subjected to a controlled temperature program, either constant or variable temperatures. When a polymer goes through its glass transition, a change in heat capacity occurs due to increased molecular motion. This change in heat capacity can be detected by DSC, making it a suitable method to determine the glass transition temperature directly.

So, the correct answer is:
