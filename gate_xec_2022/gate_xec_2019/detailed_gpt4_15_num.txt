To find the equilibrium distance between the atom pair, we need to find the value of r at which the potential energy, U(r), is at its minimum. This occurs when the derivative of U(r) with respect to r is equal to zero, i.e., dU(r)/dr = 0.

Given: A = 6 * 10^(-20) J nm^3
       B = 2.1 * 10^(-22) J nm^7

U(r) = -(A/r^3) + (B/r^7)

Now, let's find the derivative of U(r) with respect to r:

dU(r)/dr = d(-A/r^3)/dr + d(B/r^7)/dr
         = A * d(1/r^3)/dr + B * d(1/r^7)/dr

Using the power rule for differentiation (d(x^n)/dx = n*x^(n-1)), we get:

dU(r)/dr = A * (-3/r^4) + B * (-7/r^8)

Now, we need to find r when dU(r)/dr = 0:

0 = -3A/r^4 + 7B/r^8

To solve for r, we first isolate one of the terms:

3A/r^4 = 7B/r^8

Now, multiply both sides by r^8 to get rid of the denominators:

3A * r^4 = 7B

Next, we isolate r^4:

r^4 = (7B) / (3A)

Now, we enter the given values of A and B:

r^4 = (7 * 2.1 * 10^(-22) J nm^7) / (3 * 6 * 10^(-20) J nm^3)

r^4 ≈ 0.245 * 10^(-2) nm^4

To get the value of r, take the fourth root of both sides:

r = (0.245 * 10^(-2) nm^4)^(1/4)

r ≈ 0.27 nm

Therefore, the equilibrium distance between the atom pair is approximately 0.27 nm. 

The correct answer is [0.27].
