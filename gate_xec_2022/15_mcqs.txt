A student aims to deposit a thin metallic film on $SiO_2$ substrate, with an adhesion layer between the metal film and substrate, in a contiguous planar fashion. Island type of growth must be avoided. The student performs an extensive optimization exercise. Which one of the following steps is in the right direction? 
(A) Choose a metallic adhesion layer with very low interfacial energy with the deposited thin film (B) Choose a metallic adhesion layer with very low interfacial energy with $SiO_2$, irrespective of its interaction with metal film to be deposited (C) Increase the substrate temperature and decrease the deposition rate (D) Use intermittent stages of deposition followed by annealing
