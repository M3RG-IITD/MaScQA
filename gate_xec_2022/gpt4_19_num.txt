To solve this problem, we'll use the Wulff construction with the Young's equation for contact angles at the triple junction between α, β, and δ phases.

Young's equation: 
cos(θ) = (σ_αδ - σ_βδ)/σ_αβ

where θ is the contact angle, and σ represents the respective interfacial energies.

Given values:
σ_αβ = 0.4 J/m²
σ_αδ = 0.3 J/m²
σ_βδ = 0.02 J/m²

First, we need to find the value of cos(θ):

cos(θ) = (0.3 - 0.02) / 0.4
cos(θ) = 0.28 / 0.4
cos(θ) = 0.7

Now, we will use the equation for the ratio of heterogeneous nucleation to homogeneous nucleation:

ΔG_(het) / ΔG_(hom) = (2σ_αβ * (1 - cos(θ))) / σ_αβ

Plug in the values:

ΔG_(het) / ΔG_(hom) = (2 * 0.4 * (1 - 0.7)) / 0.4

Simplify:

ΔG_(het) / ΔG_(hom) = (0.8 * 0.3) / 0.4
ΔG_(het) / ΔG_(hom) = 0.24 / 0.4
ΔG_(het) / ΔG_(hom) = 0.6

Hence, the ratio of ΔG_(het) / ΔG_(hom) is approximately 0.6. Rounded off to three decimal places:
