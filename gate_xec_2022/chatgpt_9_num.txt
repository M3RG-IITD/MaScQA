First, we need to find the standard electrode potential of the electrochemical reaction we are interested in by adding the standard electrode potentials for the reduction of the species involved:

$Li^+ + e^- → Li,  E^°_{red} = -3.04 V$

$Zn^{2+} + 2e^- → Zn,  E^°_{red} = -0.77 V$

$Li^+ + Zn → Li + Zn^{2+},  E^°_{cell} = E^°_{red}(Zn^{2+}) - E^°_{red}(Li^+) = -0.77 - (-3.04) = 2.27V$

Now, we can use the Nernst equation to find the potential of the reaction against a $Zn^{2+}$/Zn electrode:

$E = E^°_{cell} - \frac{RT}{nF} ln(Q)$

where $Q$ is the reaction quotient, $n$ is the number of electrons involved in the reaction, $F$ is Faraday's constant, $R$ is the gas constant, and $T$ is the temperature.

Assuming the reaction quotient is 1 (because the problem doesn't give any concentrations), we plug in the values and solve:

$E = 2.27V - \frac{(8.314 J/mol.K) (298 K)}{2(96,485 C/mol)} ln(1)$

$E = 2.27V - 0V = 2.27V$

Therefore, the potential of the same reaction against a $Zn^{2+}$/Zn reference electrode is 2.27 V.

Answer: [2.27]
