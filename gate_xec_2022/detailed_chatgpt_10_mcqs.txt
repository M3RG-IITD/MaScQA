Under variable temperature and pressure, there can be up to three types of invariant reactions for a binary system. 

To understand why, we need to consider the phase rule, which relates the number of degrees of freedom to the number of phases and components in a system:
$$
F = C - P + 2
$$
where F is the number of degrees of freedom, C is the number of components, and P is the number of phases. 

For a binary system (C = 2) with two phases (α and β), the phase rule becomes:
$$
F = 2 - 2 + 2 = 2
$$
This means that we can vary two intensive variables (such as T and P) while still maintaining the system invariant, i.e. at a fixed composition and with two coexisting phases. 

Now, let's consider the possible reactions that can occur in this system:

- Reaction (i) α ↔ β + γ involves one component (the other is a product of the reaction) and two phases. This means that it will be an invariant reaction at a certain T and P, but as we vary T and P, the reaction may become non-invariant because it will no longer be possible to have all three phases (α, β, and γ) coexisting. Therefore, we can say that there is at least one type of invariant reaction under variable T and P.
- Reaction (ii) α + β ↔ γ involves both components of the system and two phases. Similarly, this may be an invariant reaction at certain conditions, but may become non-invariant as we vary T and P. Therefore, we can say that there is potentially another type of invariant reaction, but it depends on the system parameters.
- Finally, there could be a reaction that involves both components and all three phases, e.g. α + β ↔ γ + δ. In this case, the phase rule becomes:
$$
F = 2 - 3 + 2 = 1
$$
which means that only one intensive variable can be varied while keeping the system invariant. Therefore, this reaction could be invariant under variable T and P, depending on the specific values of T and P.

In summary, there can be up to three types of invariant reactions under variable T and P, but the exact number depends on the system parameters. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 3.
