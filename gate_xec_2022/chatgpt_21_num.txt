Let's first calculate the fraction of light transmitted through the glass panel without any absorption. This can be done using the following formula:

$T = \frac{4n_1n_2}{(n_1+n_2)^2}\sin^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)e^{-\alpha t}$

Where, 

$T$ = fraction of transmitted light

$n_1$ = refractive index of air (approx. 1)

$n_2$ = refractive index of glass (given as 1.5)

$\theta$ = angle of incidence (assumed to be normal incidence, so $\theta = 0$)

$\alpha$ = absorption coefficient (to be varied from 0.3 to 1 $cm^(-1)$)

$t$ = thickness of glass panel (given as 5 mm or 0.5 cm)

Using the given values, we get:

$T = \frac{4\times 1.5^2}{(1+1.5)^2}\sin^2(0)e^{-0.3\times 0.5} \approx 0.8178$

Now, let's calculate the maximum and minimum transmitted fractions by varying the absorption coefficient from 0.3 to 1 $cm^(-1)$:

For maximum absorption coefficient of 1 $cm^(-1)$:

$T_{max} = \frac{4\times 1.5^2}{(1+1.5)^2}\sin^2(0)e^{-1\times 0.5} \approx 0.2231$

For minimum absorption coefficient of 0.3 $cm^(-1)$:

$T_{min} = \frac{4\times 1.5^2}{(1+1.5)^2}\sin^2(0)e^{-0.3\times 0.5} \approx 0.6437$

Therefore, the ratio of maximum to minimum transmitted fractions is:

$\frac{T_{max}}{T_{min}} \approx \frac{0.2231}{0.6437} \approx \boxed{0.35}$
