Let's analyze each option in detail to understand the effect of undercooling on diffusional transformation:

Undercooling refers to the cooling of a liquid below its equilibrium freezing point (or phase transformation point) without undergoing the desired phase transformation. In the context of diffusional transformation, a higher degree of undercooling creates a larger difference between the actual temperature and the equilibrium phase transformation temperature.

(A) Rate of transformation first increases and then decreases:
With increasing undercooling, the difference in chemical potential between the α matrix and the β precipitates increases. This leads to an increase in the driving force for the transformation, resulting in an increased rate of transformation. However, as the undercooling continues to increase, the system eventually becomes less mobile due to reduced atomic mobility, causing the rate of transformation to decrease. Therefore, this statement is true.

(B) Rate of transformation first decreases and then increases:
This statement indicates the opposite behavior to (A), which we have already established as true. Therefore, this statement is false.

(C) Thermodynamic driving force increases monotonically:
As we established in the discussion for option (A), the driving force for the transformation indeed increases with increasing undercooling because the difference in chemical potential between the phases increases. The term "monotonically" means that this increase is continuous and does not change its direction. Therefore, this statement is true.

(D) Mobility of atoms in α matrix remains unchanged:
The atomic mobility is related to diffusion and is temperature-dependent. As undercooling increases, the temperature decreases, leading to reduced atomic mobility. So, this statement is false, as the mobility of the atoms in the α matrix does change with increasing undercooling.

Hence, the correct answers are:

[Option (A) and Option (C)]
