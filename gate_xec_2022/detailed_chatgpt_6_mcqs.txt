Polystyrene is a hydrophobic polymer, meaning it doesn't dissolve in water. Instead, it has strong intermolecular forces between its polymer chains, which make it a solid at room temperature.

In order to cause swelling of polystyrene, the solvent must be a good solvent for the polymer, but not a fully miscible one.

Option D- Benzene is a good solvent for polystyrene, and is often used in laboratory settings to dissolve the polymer. So, Benzene will not cause the swelling of solid polystyrene.

Option A- NaOH will deprotonate the phenyl groups of the polystyrene backbone creating a negatively charged polymer. This will cause swelling of the solid polystyrene.

Option B- HCl of pH = 6 is not strong enough to cause swelling of solid polystyrene.

Option C- Distilled water does not cause any swelling of solid polystyrene.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 0.1 M NaOH in H2O.
