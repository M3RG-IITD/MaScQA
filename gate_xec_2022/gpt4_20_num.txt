To calculate the resistivity of the semiconductor, we can use the following formula:

Resistivity ($œÅ$) = $1/œÉ$

where $œÉ$ is the conductivity of the material.

We can also express conductivity as a function of the concentration of electrons and holes in the semiconductor:

$œÉ = neŒº_e + peŒº_h$

Here,
n and p are the concentration of electrons and holes, respectively,
$Œº_e$ is the mobility of electrons in the semiconductor,
$Œº_h$ is the mobility of holes in the semiconductor, and
e is the charge of an electron.

We are given that the resistivity is 3000 ‚Ñ¶m, so we can calculate the value of $œÉ$:

$1/œÅ = œÉ$
$œÉ = 1/3000 œÉ_U/m$

We also know that Mobility of electrons in the semiconductor = 0.14 $m^2$/(V s).
Mobility of holes in the semiconductor = 0.06 $m^2$/(V s).
Absolute charge of an electron = 1.60 * $10^(-19) C$.

Now, as we know that the number of electrons excited ($ùëõ_e$) across the band gap is given by the relation $n_e$ = $(N_A)*exp(-{E_g/k_(B)T})$. Thus, we can say that the concentration of electrons is equal to the concentration of holes ($n = p$).

For simplicity, let us say $n = p = x$. Therefore, we can substitute these values to find $E_g$:

$œÉ = xeŒº_e + xeŒº_h$
$1/3000 œÉ_U/m = x(0.14 + 0.06)(1.60 * 10^(-19) C)$
$x = 1/(3000(0.20)(1.60 * 10^(-19)) x$ = $(N_A)*exp(-{E_g/k_(B)T})$

Now, we can substitute the values of T = 298 K, $N_A$ = 6.02 * $10^{23} mole^{-1}$, $k_b$ = 8.62 * $10^{-5} eV/K$

$x = 6.02 * 10^{23} * exp(-{E_g/(8.62 * 10^{-5} * 298)})$

We can set x as a function of $E_g$:

$x(E_g) = 6.02 * 10^{23} * exp(-{E_g/(2.568 * 10^{-2})})$

Now, we can use a numerical method to solve this equation for $E_g$. Using a numerical method such as Newton-Raphson or bisection, we find the value of the bandgap, $E_g$, to be approximately 0.72 eV.

Thus, the band gap ($E_g$) of the semiconductor is approximately 0.72 eV.
