A new glass material is developed to minimize the transmission of the light through the window with glass panel of thickness 5 mm. The refractive index of the glass material is 1.5 and the absorption coefficient can be changed from 0.3 $cm^(-1)$ to 1 $cm^(-1)$. In the given range of absorption coefficients, the ratio of the maximum to the minimum fraction of the light coming out of the other side of the glass panel is? (Round off to two decimal places)
