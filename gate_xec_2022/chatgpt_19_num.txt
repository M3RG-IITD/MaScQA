The equation for the change in Gibbs free energy for homogeneous nucleation is given by:

∆$G_(hom)$ = 4/3 πr$^3$ ∆G$^*$ + 4πr$^2$σ

where r is the critical radius, ∆G$^*$ is the change in Gibbs free energy per unit volume of the new phase compared to the parent phase, and σ is the interfacial energy between the new phase and the parent phase.

Similarly, the equation for the change in Gibbs free energy for heterogeneous nucleation is given by:

∆$G_(het)$ = 4/3 πr$^3$ ∆G$^*$ + 4πr$^2$(σ$_{α-β}$ + σ$_{β-δ}$ - σ$_{α-δ}$cosθ)

where θ is the contact angle between the β particle and the substrate δ.

The ratio of ∆$G_(het)$ to ∆$G_(hom)$ is given by:

$ΔG_(het)$/$ΔG_(hom)$ = (σ$_{α- β}$ + σ$_{β- δ}$ - σ$_{α-δ}$cosθ)/σ

Plugging in the given values, we get:

$ΔG_(het)$/$ΔG_(hom)$ = (0.4 + 0.02 - 0.3cosθ)/0.02

Since the value of θ is not given, we cannot find the exact value of the ratio. However, we can find the range of values the ratio can take by considering the extreme cases:

1. If θ = 0 (i.e., the β particle completely wets the substrate), then cosθ = 1 and the ratio becomes:

$ΔG_(het)$/$ΔG_(hom)$ = (0.4 + 0.02 - 0.3)/0.02 = 6

2. If θ = 180° (i.e., the β particle does not wet the substrate at all), then cosθ = -1 and the ratio becomes:

$ΔG_(het)$/$ΔG_(hom)$ = (0.4 + 0.02 + 0.3)/0.02 = 36

Therefore, the value of $ΔG_(het)$/$ΔG_(hom)$ can range from 6 to 36.
