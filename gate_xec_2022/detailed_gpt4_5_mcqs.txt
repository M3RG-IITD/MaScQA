To find the case in which the DSC thermogram will exhibit a spike, we need to analyze each option.

(A) Heating 10 mg of pure Cu from 323 K to 673 K
Pure Cu undergoes no phase transitions (e.g., melting or boiling) within this temperature range; it remains a solid throughout. Therefore, no spike is expected since there are no phase transitions.

(B) Cooling pure water from 323 K to 278 K
Cooling water from 323 K to 278 K (above the freezing point of water at 273 K) involves no phase transitions. The water remains a liquid, and we expect no spike in the DSC thermogram.

(C) Heating pure ice from 263 K to 284 K
The temperature range in this case runs from 263 K to 284 K, crossing the melting point of pure water at 273 K (0 °C). During melting, there is a significant heat absorption, resulting in a spike in the DSC thermogram.

(D) Cooling a Pb-Sn alloy at the eutectic composition from 323 K to 273 K
The eutectic composition of a Pb-Sn alloy occurs at approximately 183 °C (456 K). Since the given temperature range lies entirely below that point, no phase transitions are expected (the alloy will remain solid), and there will be no spike in the DSC thermogram.

The correct answer is [C].
