To find the time taken for A to diffuse to the same depth at 600 K, we use Fick's second law, which states that $x = \sqrt{2*D_1*t_1} = \sqrt{2*D_2*t_2}$

Here, $x$ is the diffusion depth (10 μm), $D_1$ and $D_2$ are the diffusivity's of A at temperatures 300 K and 600 K, and $t_1$ and $t_2$ are the times for diffusion at the respective temperatures.

First, let's find $D_1 = (D_A)°*exp(-{E_a/k_B*T_1})$. We are given everything except $(D_A)°$.

We know that $x = \sqrt{2*D_1*t_1} = \sqrt{2*(D_A)°*exp(-{E_a/k_B*T_1})*t_1}$ where $t_1$ = 1 hour = 3600 seconds and $x = 10 μm = 10 * 10^{-6} m$.

Now, let's rearrange for $(D_A)°$:

$(D_A)° = \frac{x^2}{2*t_1*exp(-{E_a/k_B*T_1})}$

Plug in the values:

$(D_A)° = \frac{(10 * 10^{-6})^2}{2*3600*\text{exp}(-\frac{0.3}{8.62*10^{-5}*300})} = 0.0000000253762$ (approximately)

Now, we need to find $D_2 = (D_A)°*\text{exp}(-{E_a/k_B*T_2})$:

$D_2 = 0.0000000253762 * \text{exp}(-\frac{0.3}{8.62*10^{-5}*600}) = 0.0000001851396$ (approximately)

Finally, we can find $t_2$ by solving the equation:

$\sqrt{2*D_2*t_2} = x$

$t_2 = \frac{x^2}{2*D_2} = \frac{(10 * 10^{-6})^2}{2*0.0000001851396} = 270.2 \text{ seconds}$ (approximately)

So, the time taken for A to diffuse to the same depth at 600 K is approximately 270.2 seconds.
