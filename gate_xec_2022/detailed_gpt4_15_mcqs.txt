To avoid island-type growth, the student needs to ensure that the metallic film is deposited uniformly on the adhesion layer and $SiO_2$ substrate. This can be achieved by optimizing the interfacial energies, substrate temperature, and deposition rate. We will go through each option and analyze them:

(A) Choose a metallic adhesion layer with very low interfacial energy with the deposited thin film:

A low interfacial energy between the adhesion layer and the deposited metallic film promotes wetting and uniform deposition of the film. Therefore, this step is in the right direction for a contiguous planar metallic film deposition.

(B) Choose a metallic adhesion layer with very low interfacial energy with $SiO_2$, irrespective of its interaction with the metal film to be deposited:

While a low interfacial energy between the adhesion layer and the $SiO_2$ substrate is essential for good adhesion, it is not enough to ensure a contiguous planar growth of the metallic film unless its interaction with the metal film is also taken into account. Hence, this step is not in the right direction by itself.

(C) Increase the substrate temperature and decrease the deposition rate:

Increasing the substrate temperature promotes surface diffusion, which leads to a more uniform distribution of adatoms on the substrate. This can help with achieving a contiguous planar metallic film deposition. Decreasing the deposition rate allows more time for adatoms to diffuse and settle into a uniform film, further promoting a contiguous planar growth. This step is in the right direction.

(D) Use intermittent stages of deposition followed by annealing:

Using intermittent stages of deposition followed by annealing can help with the chemical and structural ordering of the deposited film. Although it may partially help with the contiguous planar growth, it is not the most effective approach for ensuring a contiguous planar film deposition. This step may be helpful in certain cases, but it is not the most direct way to address the problem.

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:
