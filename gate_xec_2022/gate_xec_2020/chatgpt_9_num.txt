We can use the following equation to find the radius of the critical nucleus:

$r^* = \frac{2\gamma_{sl}v_m}{ΔG_v}$

where $v_m$ is the molar volume of the liquid. 

To convert the given units of $\gamma_{sl}$ from $J.m^{-2}$ to $J.m^{-3}$, we need to multiply by the molar volume of the solid, $v_s$. Assuming that the solid and liquid have similar molar volumes, we can approximate $v_m \approx v_s$. 

Then, we can rewrite the equation as:

$r^* = \frac{2\gamma_{sl}v_s}{ΔG_v} = \frac{2(0.18\;J.m^{-2})(v_s)}{0.18 \times 10^9\;J.m^{-3}}$

The value of $v_s$ depends on the specific metal being considered. Let's assume it is 7.1 $cm^3.mol^{-1}$ for copper. We need to convert this to $m^3.mol^{-1}$, which gives us:

$v_s = 7.1 \times 10^{-6} \;m^3.mol^{-1}$

Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

$r^* = \frac{2(0.18\;J.m^{-2})(7.1 \times 10^{-6} \;m^3.mol^{-1})}{0.18 \times 10^9\;J.m^{-3}} \approx 2.0 \;nm$

Therefore, the radius of the critical nucleus at temperature $T_s$ is approximately 2.0 nm. 

Answer: 
- 2.0 nm
