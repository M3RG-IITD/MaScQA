Given data:

Fracture toughness, $$K_{IC} = 1 \ MPa.m^{\frac{1}{2}}$$ 

Maximum stress, $$\sigma = 200 \ MPa$$ 

Geometrical factor, $$f = 1.2$$ 

We need to find out the maximum value of half crack length $a$, below which the material does not fail. 

The loading condition for the sample is shown in the Image below:

The fracture toughness $(K_{IC})$, maximum stress ($\sigma$), and geometrical factor (f) are related by the following equation:

$$\sigma\sqrt{\pi a} = K_{IC}f$$

Substituting the given values, we get:

$$200 \times \sqrt{\pi a} = 1 \times 1.2$$

$$\sqrt{\pi a} = \frac{1.2}{200}$$

$$\sqrt{\pi a} = 0.006$$

$$\pi a = 0.000036$$

$$a = \frac{0.000036}{\pi}$$

$$a = 0.00001146 \ m$$

Converting meters to micrometers, we get:

$$a = 11.46 \ \mu m$$

Therefore, the maximum value of half crack length $a$, below which the material does not fail, is **11.5 Î¼m (rounded off to one decimal place)**.
