Given,

$n_i$ = $2* [2πmk_(B)T/h^(2)]^(3/2)$ * $exp(-{E_g/k_(B)T})$

Mass of an electron, m = 9.1 * $10^(-31)$ kg

Charge of an electron, e = 1.6 * $10^(-19)$ C

Boltzmann constant $k_B$ = 1.38 * $10^(-23)$ J.$K^(-1)$

Planck’s constant h = 6.6 * $10^(-34)$ J.$s^(-1)$

Band gap ($E_g$) of Si = 1.1 eV

Concentration of P atoms = 1 ppm = 1/($10^6$) * 5 * $10^(28)$ atoms/$m^3$ = 5 * $10^(22)$ atoms/$m^3$

Temperature T = 300K

Now, we can calculate the electron density and hole density for pure Si as

$n_o$ = $p_o$ = $n_i$ = $2* [2πmk_(B)T/h^(2)]^(3/2)$ * $exp(-{E_g/k_(B)T})$

= 2* [2π*(9.1 * $10^(-31)$ kg)*(1.38 * $10^(-23)$ J.$K^(-1)$)*(300 K)/$(6.6 * 10^(-34)$ J.$s^(-1))^(2)]^(3/2) * exp(-{(1.1 eV)/(1.38 * $10^(-23)$ J/$K^(-1)$ * 300K)})

= $2.32 * 10^(19)$ $m^(-3)$

Now, after doping with P atoms, the electron density will increase by a donor concentration (N_d) and the hole density will correspondingly decrease. Assuming all the P atoms are ionized and the system is neutral, the mobile electron density will be equal to the P atom concentration, i.e.,

$n$ = $N_d$ = 5* $10^(22)$ $m^(-3)$

The hole density after doping, $p$, can be calculated using the equation for neutrality as follows:

$n_o$ $p_o$ = $N_d^2$

$p_o$ = $N_d^2$/$n_o$ = ($5 * 10^(22))^2/(2.32 * 10^(19))$ = $1.08 * 10^(6)$ $m^(-3)$

Now, the difference between the Fermi energy ($E_F$) in the doped and undoped cases can be calculated using the following equation :

$N_d$ = $2 * [(2πmk_(B)T)/h^(2)]^(3/2)$ * $exp(E_F$-$E_i$)/$k_(B)T$

where $E_i$ is the intrinsic Fermi level of pure Si (i.e., halfway between the valence and conduction band energies at T = 0K), which can be approximated as the midgap energy in eV:

$E_i$ = $E_g$/2 = 0.55 eV

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation, and solving for $E_F$-$E_i$, we get:

$E_F-E_i$ = ln($N_d$/$n_i$)/(2*3/2 ln(2πmk_B/h^(2)))

= ln[(5* $10^(22)$)/2.32* $10^(19)$]/[(2*3/2)* ln(2π*(9.1 * $10^(-31)$ kg)*(1.38 * $10^(-23)$ J.$K^(-1)$)*(300 K)/(6.6 * $10^(-34)$ J.$s^(-1)))]

= 0.496 eV

Therefore, the shift in Fermi energy upon doping, with respect to the intrinsic Fermi level of pure Si would be +0.50 eV

Answer: [0.50]
