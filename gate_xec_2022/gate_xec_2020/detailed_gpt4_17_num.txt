To calculate the transmittance, we will first find the intensity of light transmitted through the material after each reflection. Then, we will consider the absorption of light during transmission through the material using the absorption coefficient.

Let's denote the intensity of light incident on the material as $I_0$ and after the first transmission and reflection as $I_1$. Now, due to the reflection at the first surface, the intensity is reduced by R, so the initial transmitted intensity will be $(1-R)I_0$

As the light passes through the material, it is absorbed according to the absorption coefficient α. The intensity after absorption is given by the Beer-Lambert Law, which states:

$I_1 = I_0 (1 - R) e^{-αx}$

Now, the light will be reflected from the second surface which has reflectance R. So, the intensity that gets reflected is $RI_1$. This reflected intensity will pass through the material again, so it will be absorbed according to the absorption coefficient α.

$I_{1R} = RI_1e^{-αx} = RI_0 (1 - R) e^{-2αx}$

Now, add the intensities of transmitted light ($I_1$) and the reflected light ($I_{1R}$) to get the total intensity ($I$) of the light transmitted through the material:

$I = I_1 + I_{1R} = I_0 (1 - R) e^{-αx} + RI_0 (1 - R) e^{-2αx}$

Finally, we can calculate the transmittance (T) of the material, which is the ratio of the transmitted intensity (I) to the incident intensity ($I_0$):

$T = I/I_0 = (1 - R) e^{-αx} + R(1 - R) e^{-2αx}$

Now substitute the given values of α and R into the equation:

$T = (1 - 0.05) e^{-10^3x} + 0.05(1 - 0.05) e^{-2(10^3x)}$

$T = 0.95 e^{-10^3x} + 0.0475 e^{-2(10^3x)}$

To find the transmittance, we need the thickness (x) of the material. Since it is not provided, we will express the transmittance in terms of the thickness x:

$T = 0.95 e^{-10^3x} + 0.0475 e^{-2(10^3x)}$

Here is the transmittance formula expressed in terms of x, and we cannot round-off to three decimal places without knowing the value of x:

$T(x) = [0.95 e^{-10^3x} + 0.0475 e^{-2(10^3x)}]$
