Given: Permittivity of free space ($ε_°$) is 8.85 * $10^(-12)F.m^(-1)$. A piezoelectric ceramic with piezoelectric coefficient ($d_(zz)$) value of 100 * $10^(-12)C.N^(-1)$ is subjected to a force, $F_z$ of 10N, applied normal to its x-y face, as shown in the figure. If relative dielectric constant ($ε_r$) of the material is 1100, the voltage(in volts) developed along the z-direction of the sample will be? (round-off to two decimal places). Ignore any nonlinear effects.
