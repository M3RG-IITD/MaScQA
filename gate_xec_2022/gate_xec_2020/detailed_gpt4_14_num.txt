Since the probability of an accident occurring in a given month is 1/100, the probability of no accident occurring in a given month is 1 - 1/100 = 99/100.

Now, we are given that the events of individual months are independent of each other. That means, for 'n' consecutive months, we need to multiply the probabilities of no accident occurring in each month to find the overall probability P(n).

So, P(n) = (99/100) * (99/100) *...* (99/100) [multiply 'n' times] = (99/100)^n

We need to find the smallest integer value of 'n' such that P(n) ≤ ½.

(99/100)^n ≤ 1/2

To solve this inequality for 'n', we can take the logarithm of both sides (using any base; let's use the natural logarithm, denoted by ln).

n * ln(99/100) ≤ ln(1/2)

Now, we need to isolate 'n'.

n ≥ ln(1/2) / ln(99/100)

To find the value of this expression, we can use a calculator to find the logarithms:

n ≥ ln(0.5) / ln(0.99) ≈ 68.967

Since we're looking for the smallest integer value of 'n', we need to round up:

n ≥ 69

Therefore, the smallest integer value of 'n' such that P(n) ≤ ½ is 69.

Answer: [69]
