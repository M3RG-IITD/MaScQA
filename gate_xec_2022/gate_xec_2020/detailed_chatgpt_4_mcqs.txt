The number of states in a three dimensional solid with energy between E and E + dE is given by

$$
dN = D(E) g(E) dE
$$

where $g(E) dE$ is the number of states between E and E + dE per unit volume. The density of states D(E) is related to the number of states per unit volume by

$$
D(E) = \frac{1}{V} \frac{dN}{dE}
$$

where V is the volume of the solid.

If the density of states varies with energy as $E^\alpha$, then we have

$$
D(E) = \frac{1}{V} \frac{dN}{dE} = \frac{1}{V} g(E) \frac{dN}{d\epsilon} \frac{d\epsilon}{dE} = g(E) \frac{1}{V} \left(\frac{dN}{d\epsilon}\right)_{\epsilon = E} \left(\frac{d\epsilon}{dE}\right) = g(E) \rho(\epsilon) \frac{1}{V} \left(\frac{d\epsilon}{dE}\right),
$$

where $\epsilon = E/E_0$, and $\rho(\epsilon)$ is a dimensionless function of energy.

For a free electron gas, $g(E) dE$ is given by

$$
g(E) dE = \frac{V}{\pi^2} \left(\frac{2m}{\hbar^2}\right)^{3/2} \sqrt{E} dE,
$$

and we have

$$
D(E) = \frac{1}{V} \frac{dN}{dE} = \frac{1}{V} g(E) \frac{dN}{d\epsilon} \frac{d\epsilon}{dE} = \frac{1}{\pi^2} \left(\frac{2m}{\hbar^2}\right)^{3/2} \sqrt{E}.
$$

Comparing this to $D(E) = g(E) \rho(\epsilon) \frac{1}{V} \left(\frac{d\epsilon}{dE}\right)$, we can see that $\rho(\epsilon) = \frac{1}{\pi^2} \left(\frac{2m}{\hbar^2}\right)^{3/2}$, and $\alpha = \frac{1}{2}$.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) $E^{1/2}$.
