We want to find the smallest integer n such that the probability of no accident occurring in n months is less than or equal to 1/2. Since the events of individual months are independent, the probability of no accident over n months is the product of the probabilities of no accident in each month.

The probability of no accident in a given month is 1 - 1/100 = 99/100.

So, P(n) = (99/100)^n ≤ 1/2.

We can solve for n as follows:

(99/100)^n ≤ 1/2
n*log(99/100) ≤ log(1/2)
n ≥ log(1/2) / log(99/100)

Using a calculator, we get:

n ≥ -0.693 / -0.010 = 69.3

Since we need the smallest integer value of n, we should round up to 70.

Answer: [70]
