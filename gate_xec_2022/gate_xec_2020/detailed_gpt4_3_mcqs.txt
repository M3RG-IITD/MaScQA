Given that the image has a hexagonal motif, we can deduce the rotational symmetry present in the system.

Rotational symmetry refers to the number of times an object can be rotated and still look the same. In general, for regular polygons, the rotational symmetry is equal to the number of sides.

For a hexagonal motif, the hexagon has six sides. Therefore, the hexagon can be rotated about its center, and it will look the same after every 60 degrees (360 degrees divided by 6 sides) of rotation.

Now, let us analyze the given options:

(A) Six-fold rotation: Consider a full rotation of 360 degrees around the center of the hexagon. After every 60 degrees (360/6) rotation, the hexagonal motif will have the same appearance. After six 60-degree rotations, it would complete a full 360-degree rotation, which means it has six-fold rotational symmetry.

(B) Two-fold rotation: A two-fold rotational symmetry means that the object looks the same after a 180-degree rotation. However, this is not true for a hexagonal motif, which looks the same after every 60-degree rotation.

(C) Three-fold rotation: A three-fold rotational symmetry means that an object looks the same after 120 degrees of rotation (360/3). While a hexagonal motif does look the same after each 120-degree rotation, it also has additional symmetry points every 60 degrees, which makes it a six-fold rotational symmetry.

(D) Four-fold rotation: A four-fold rotational symmetry refers to an object that looks the same after every 90-degree rotation (360/4). A hexagonal motif does not have four-fold rotational symmetry because it does not look the same after every 90-degree rotation.

From the analysis above, we can conclude that the correct answer is:

[A] Six-fold rotation
