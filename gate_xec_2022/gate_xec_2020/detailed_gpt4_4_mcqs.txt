The density of states (DOS) is a term used in solid state physics to describe the number of energy levels available in a material for electrons. In a three-dimensional solid, the density of states (D(E)) is proportionate to the number of energy levels per unit volume that are available for electrons to occupy as a function of energy.

To determine how D(E) varies with energy (E) for a 3D solid, let's first derive an expression for D(E).

For a three-dimensional solid, we first consider the energy dispersion relation: 

E = ħ²k² / (2m)

where E is the energy, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, k is the wave vector (which can be expressed as k = 2π/λ, where λ is the wavelength of the electron wave function), and m is the effective mass of the electron.

Now, we define a quantity V(k) which is the volume in k-space corresponding to energy less than or equal to E. In other words, V(k) is the volume in k-space enclosed by the constant-energy surface where the wave vector k is less than or equal to the maximum value k = k_max. 

Since E depends on k², we can write:

k_max² = 2mE / ħ²

The volume V(k) in k-space can be computed as a sphere of radius k_max:

V(k) = (4/3)πk_max³

Now we can relate V(k) to the number of allowed energy states N(E) in the material. The number of accessible k-states is equal to the volume in k-space V(k) multiplied by the number of states per unit volume in k-space. This density of states in k-space is given by (1 / (2π/L)³), where L is the length of a side in a cubical solid. Thus,

N(E) = V(k) × (1 / (2π/L)³)

Now, we differentiate N(E) with respect to E to obtain the density of states as a function of energy D(E).

D(E) = (dN(E) / dE) = (dN(E) / dk_max) × (dk_max / dE)

Note that:

dk_max / dE = d(k_max²) / dE = (2m / ħ²) × (1/2)

and 

dN(E) / dk_max = d(V(k) × (1 / (2π/L)³)) / dk_max = (4πk_max² × (1 / (2π/L)³)) × 3k_max² = (6πk_max² × (1 / (2π/L)³))

Now we plug our expressions for dk_max/dE and dN(E)/dk_max into the expression for D(E):

D(E) = ((6πk_max² × (1 / (2π/L)³)) × (1/2)) × (2m / ħ²)

We know that k_max² = 2mE / ħ², so let's write k_max in terms of E:

k_max = √(2mE / ħ²)

Substituting this in the expression for D(E) gives:

D(E) = (6π((2mE / ħ²) × (1 / (2π/L)³)) × (1/2m)) × (1/ħ²)

Simplifying, we get:

D(E) ∝ E^(1/2)

So the density of states D(E) varies with energy E as E^(1/2) for a three-dimensional solid.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A).
