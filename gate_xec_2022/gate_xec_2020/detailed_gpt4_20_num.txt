To solve this problem, we will first use the iso-strain condition, then calculate the required specific modulus of the composite, and then use the rule of mixtures to find the volume fraction of SiC particles in the composite.

Step 1: Iso-strain Condition

The iso-strain condition assumes that the constituents (Al and SiC) experience the same strain when subjected to an external load. Under the iso-strain condition, the elastic modulus E of the composite can be expressed by the rule of mixtures as:

E_c = V_Al * E_Al + V_SiC * E_SiC

where E_c is the composite's elastic modulus, V_Al and V_SiC are the volume fractions of Al and SiC respectively, and E_Al and E_SiC are the elastic moduli of Al and SiC respectively. Note that V_Al + V_SiC = 1 since the volume fractions add up to the total volume (unity).

Step 2: Calculate the Required Specific Modulus

We are given that the specific modulus of the composite should be three times that of pure Al. The specific modulus is defined as:

Specific Modulus = E / ρ

where E is the elastic modulus and ρ is the density. For the composite and pure Al, we can write:

E_c / ρ_c = 3 * (E_Al / ρ_Al)

Step 3: Use the Rule of Mixtures for Density

The density of the composite, ρ_c, can be expressed by the rule of mixtures for density as:

ρ_c = V_Al * ρ_Al + V_SiC * ρ_SiC

Step 4: Solve for the Volume Fraction of SiC

Now we have a system of equations that can be solved for the volume fraction of SiC:

1. E_c = V_Al * E_Al + V_SiC * E_SiC
2. ρ_c = V_Al * ρ_Al + V_SiC * ρ_SiC
3. E_c / ρ_c = 3 * (E_Al / ρ_Al)

First, divide equation 1 by equation 2:

(E_c / ρ_c) = (V_Al * E_Al / V_Al * ρ_Al) + (V_SiC * E_SiC / V_SiC * ρ_SiC)

Use equation 3 to replace (E_c / ρ_c):

3 * (E_Al / ρ_Al) = (E_Al / ρ_Al) + (E_SiC / ρ_SiC) * (V_SiC / V_Al)

Now solve for V_SiC / V_Al:

2 * (E_Al / ρ_Al) = (E_SiC / ρ_SiC) * (V_SiC / V_Al)

Let's assume the following material property values for Al and SiC:

E_Al = 70 GPa, ρ_Al = 2700 kg/m³
E_SiC = 410 GPa, ρ_SiC = 3200 kg/m³

Plug in these values:

2 * (70 / 2700) = (410 / 3200) * (V_SiC / V_Al)

Now solve for the ratio V_SiC / V_Al:

V_SiC / V_Al = 2.127

To find the volume fractions of SiC and Al, we'll use the fact that V_Al + V_SiC = 1:

V_SiC = V_Al * 2.127
V_Al + V_SiC = 1

Substituting for V_SiC:

V_Al + 2.127 * V_Al = 1
V_Al (1 + 2.127) = 1
V_Al = 1 / 3.127 = 0.32 (rounded to two decimal places)

Finally, find the volume fraction of SiC:

V_SiC = 1 - V_Al = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68 (rounded to two decimal places)

Answer: The volume fraction of SiC particles in the composite is [0.68].
