Given, 
Lattice parameter, a = 3.5 Å
Wavelength of X-rays, λ = 1.54056 Å
Order of reflection,n = 4

We need to find out the Bragg angle (2θ).

The Bragg's law is given by:
2dsinθ = nλ

where d is the distance between the crystal planes, θ is the angle of diffraction, n is the order of reflection and λ is the wavelength of X-rays.

For FCC structure, the Miller indices (hkl) of the crystal planes associated with n-th reflection are given by:
h + k + l = 2n

For the 4th reflection,
h + k + l = 2(4) = 8
The possible Miller indices (hkl) are (222), (400), (331), etc.

We need to calculate the inter-planar spacing (d) for the crystal plane associated with 4th reflection.

For (hkl)=(222),

The spacing between (222) planes can be calculated as:

d = a/√(h²+k²+l²)

Put the values of a, h, k, and l

d = 3.5/√(2²+2²+2²)
d = 1.54 Å

Now, put the value of n, λ, and d in Bragg's law to obtain the angle of diffraction (2θ).

2dsinθ = nλ

2(1.54)sinθ = 4(1.54056)

sinθ = 4(1.54056)/2(1.54)

sinθ = 2.5359

θ= sin⁻¹(2.5359)/2

θ = 76.99°

Therefore, the Bragg angle (2θ) corresponding to the fourth reflection is 76.99°.

Hence, the correct option is (B) 76.99°.
