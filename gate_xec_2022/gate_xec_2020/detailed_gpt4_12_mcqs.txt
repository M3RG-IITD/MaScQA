To solve this problem, we will start by recalling the Bragg's Law and then find the conditions for an allowed reflection in an FCC lattice. 

Bragg's Law: nλ = 2dsinθ

where n is an integer known as the order of reflection, λ is the wavelength of the incident X-ray, d is the interplanar spacing, and θ is the Bragg angle between the incident X-ray and the reflecting plane.

In an FCC lattice, the lattice parameter a is the edge length of the unit cell. The shortest distance between the (hkl) planes (which gives the maximum reflection angle) can be found using the following formula for the interplanar spacing:

d = a / sqrt(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)

where d is the interplanar spacing, and (h, k, l) are the Miller indices of the plane.

For an allowed reflection in an FCC lattice, the sum of the Miller indices (h+k+l) must be even.
 
We are given the lattice parameter a = 3.5 Å and the X-ray wavelength λ = 1.54056 Å. The problem asks for the 2θ value corresponding to the fourth reflection. Therefore, n = 4.

Now, we have to find the four lowest values of (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) such that the sum of the Miller indices (h+k+l) is even:

1. (1,1,1) -> 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3
2. (1,1,0) -> 1^2 + 1^2 + 0^2 = 2
3. (2,0,0) -> 2^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 4
4. (2,2,0) -> 2^2 + 2^2 + 0^2 = 8

Now we can calculate the interplanar spacings (d) for these Miller indices:

1. d(111) = a / sqrt(3) = 3.5 / sqrt(3) Å
2. d(110) = a / sqrt(2) = 3.5 / sqrt(2) Å
3. d(200) = a / 2 = 3.5 / 2 Å
4. d(220) = a / sqrt(8) = 3.5 / sqrt(8) Å

Now we can use Bragg's Law to find the Bragg angle (θ) for each reflection:

1. θ(111) = arcsin(4λ / 2d(111))
2. θ(110) = arcsin(4λ / 2d(110))
3. θ(200) = arcsin(4λ / 2d(200))
4. θ(220) = arcsin(4λ / 2d(220))

Once we compute these angles, we can choose the appropriate one corresponding to the fourth reflection:

1. θ(111) = arcsin(4 * 1.54056 / (2 * 3.5 / sqrt(3))) = 39.44°
2. θ(110) = arcsin(4 * 1.54056 / (2 * 3.5 / sqrt(2))) = 49.61°
3. θ(200) = arcsin(4 * 1.54056 / (2 * 3.5 / 2)) = 70.16°
4. θ(220) = arcsin(4 * 1.54056 / (2 * 3.5 / sqrt(8))) = 93.80°

The Bragg angle corresponding to the fourth reflection is 93.80°. To find the 2θ value, we just need to multiply this Bragg angle by 2:

2θ = 2 * 93.80° = 187.60°

However, this value is greater than 180° (which is the maximum value of 2θ), so we need to subtract 180° to obtain the correct value:

2θ = 187.60° - 180° = 7.60°

Therefore, the Bragg angle (2θ) corresponding to the fourth reflection is neither of the given options. The correct answer is:

[E] 7.60°
