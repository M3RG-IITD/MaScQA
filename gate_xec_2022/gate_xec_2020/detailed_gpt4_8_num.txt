To solve this problem step by step, we first need to understand some key concepts.

1. Compressive stress: Compressive stress is the stress experienced by a material when it is being compressed. In this case, the maximum compressive stress that the material can withstand without failure is given as 200 MPa.

2. Coefficient of thermal expansion ($\alpha$): This is a measure of how much a material expands or contracts per unit change in temperature. In this case, the material's coefficient of thermal expansion is given as $7.5 \times 10^{-6} °C^{-1}$.

3. Modulus of elasticity (E): This is a property of a material that describes its tendency to deform elastically (i.e., non-permanently) when a force is applied to it. In this case, the material's modulus of elasticity is given as 200 GPa.

Now, let's consider that the material is heated from 25°C to a final temperature $T_f$ and experiences a change in temperature ($\Delta T$). The change in temperature can be expressed as:

$\Delta T = T_f - 25$

The material undergoes dimensional change because of the temperature change. Assuming that the material remains dimensionally constrained, the thermal strain ($\epsilon$) caused by the expansion of the material is given by:

$\epsilon = \alpha \times \Delta T$

As the material is dimensionally constrained, it will experience stress as it expands. The stress experienced by the material ($\sigma$) can be calculated using Hooke's Law, which relates stress to strain and modulus of elasticity:

$\sigma = E \times \epsilon$

In this case, the material will fail if the stress experienced during thermal cycling exceeds the maximum compressive stress (200 MPa). Therefore, we have the following inequality:

$E \times \epsilon > 200 \, MPa$

Substitute the expressions for $\epsilon$ and $\Delta T$ in the inequality:

$E \times (\alpha \times \Delta T) > 200 \, MPa$

$200 \, GPa \times (7.5 \times 10^{-6} °C^{-1} \times (T_f - 25)) > 200 \times 10^6 \, Pa$

Divide both sides by $200 \times 10^9 \, Pa \times 7.5 \times 10^{-6} °C^{-1}$:

$T_f - 25 > \frac{200 \times 10^6 \, Pa}{200 \times 10^9 \, Pa \times 7.5 \times 10^{-6} °C^{-1}}$

$T_f - 25 > \frac{1}{7.5 \times 10^{-3}}$

$T_f - 25 > \frac{1000}{7.5}$

$T_f - 25 > 133.33$

$T_f > 158.33$

Round off to the nearest integer, we get the lowest value of $T_f$ at which the material will fail:

$T_f = 159 °C$

Thus, the correct answer is:
