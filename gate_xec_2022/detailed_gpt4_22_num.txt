To find the lattice parameter of the face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal, we will use Bragg's Law and the plane spacing equation for FCC structures.

Bragg's Law states:

nλ = 2d * sin(𝜃)

Where:
- n is the order of reflection (n = 1 for first-order reflections)
- λ is the wavelength of the X-ray beam (1.54 Å)
- d is the interplanar spacing
- 𝜃 is the angle between the incident and reflected rays (given as 2𝜃 = 45°, so 𝜃 = 22.5°)

For an FCC structure, the general equation for interplanar spacing (d) for the hkl planes is:

d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²)

Where:
- a is the lattice parameter
- h, k, and l are the Miller indices

The third peak in the X-ray diffraction pattern corresponds to the {220} set of planes in an FCC structure, so h = 2, k = 2, and l = 0.

Now, we can use Bragg's Law and the plane spacing equation for FCC structures to find the lattice parameter (a).

1. First, let's find the interplanar spacing (d) using Bragg's Law:

(1)(1.54 Å) = 2d * sin(22.5°)
1.54 Å = 2d * 0.3827
d = (1.54 Å) / (2 * 0.3827) ≈ 2.01 Å

2. Next, we substitute the values of h, k, and l into the equation for interplanar spacing (d) in an FCC structure:

2.01 Å = a / sqrt(2² + 2² + 0²)

3. Now, we solve for the lattice parameter (a):

a = 2.01 Å * sqrt(2² + 2²)
a = 2.01 Å * sqrt(8)
a = 2.01 Å * 2.83
a ≈ 5.68 Å

The lattice parameter of the face-centered cubic crystal is approximately 5.68 Å.
