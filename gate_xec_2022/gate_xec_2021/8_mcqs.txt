A metal has a melting point of 600 °C. By rapid cooling, liquid metal can be made to solidify either at 500 °C or 400 °C or 300  °C. Critical size of the solid nuclei is 
(A) same for solidification at 400 °C and 500 °C (B) smaller for solidification at 400  °C as compared to solidification at 500 °C (C) larger for solidification at 400 °C as compared to solidification at 500 °C (D) the smallest for solidification at 300 °C
