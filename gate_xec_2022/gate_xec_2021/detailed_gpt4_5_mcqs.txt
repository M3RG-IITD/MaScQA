Let's analyze each reaction/transformation in detail:

(P) Eutectoid reaction:
Eutectoid reaction is a three-phase reaction in which a single solid phase transforms into two other distinct solid phases at a specific composition and temperature. This process involves diffusion of atoms within the solid.

(Q) Martensitic transformation:
Martensitic transformation is a diffusionless phase transformation in which the parent phase (austenite) undergoes a shear deformation or rearrangement of atoms, producing the martensite phase. It does not involve the movement of atoms over long distances (i.e., no diffusion).

(R) Precipitation reaction:
Precipitation reaction involves the formation of a new solid phase from a supersaturated solution or solid solution due to changes in temperature or composition. This process involves diffusion to form a new solid phase.

Now, let's match these transformations/reactions with the information in Column II:

(P) Eutectoid reaction matches with (2) one solid phase transforms into two solid phases.
(Q) Martensitic transformation matches with (1) involves no diffusion.
(R) Precipitation reaction matches with (3) occurs in supersaturated solutions.

So, the correct option is:

(C) P-2; Q-1; R-3
