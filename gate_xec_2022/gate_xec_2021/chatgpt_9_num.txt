Given: 

Mass of magnet, m = 50 g 

Magnetic moment, M = $4.2 × 10^{−7} Am^2$ 

Density of magnet, $\rho$ = $7.2 g cm^{−3}$ 

Intensity of magnetization, I = ? 

We know that, 

Intensity of magnetization (I) = $\frac{M}{\rho V}$ 

where V is the volume of the magnet. 

But we also know that, 

Magnetic moment (M) = $\frac{IA}{l}$ 

where A is the area of cross section of the magnet and l is the length of the magnet. 

We can rewrite this equation as, 

$I = \frac{Ml}{\rho V A}$ 

But we know that, 

Density = $\frac{mass}{volume}$ 

or, 

Volume = $\frac{mass}{density}$ 

Substituting the values of M, m, $\rho$, and volume in the above equation, we get: 

$I = \frac{Ml}{\rho (\frac{m}{\rho}) A}$ 

Simplifying, 

$I = \frac{M}{m A}$ 

Substituting the given values, 

$I = \frac{4.2 × 10^{−7} Am^2}{50g \frac{1}{10000} m^2}$ 

$I = 8.4 × 10^{−4} Am^{−1}$ 

Rounding off to 3 decimal places, 

$I$ = 0.0008 $Am^{−1}$ 

Answer: 

The intensity of magnetization is 0.0008 $Am^{−1}$.
