At constant temperature and pressure, the condition for two phases (α and β) to be in equilibrium is that their Gibbs free energies are equal. This can be expressed mathematically as:

$G_{\alpha} = G_{\beta}$

where G is the Gibbs free energy.

The Gibbs free energy is given by:

$G = H - TS$

where H is the enthalpy, T is the temperature, and S is the entropy.

At constant temperature and pressure, the enthalpy does not change for two phases in equilibrium, so the condition reduces to:

$S_{\alpha} = S_{\beta}$

In other words, the entropy of the two phases must be equal for them to be in equilibrium.

Therefore, the correct option is (A) entropy of the system should be maximum.
