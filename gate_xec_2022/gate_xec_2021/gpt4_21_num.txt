Let the side of the cubic green compact be x cm. We know that the volume of the green compact and the sintered compact are equal, minus the volume of the porosity in the green compact.

The volume of the green compact = x³ cm³
The volume of the porosity in the green compact = 18% of x³ = 0.18x³ cm³
The volume of the solid material in the green compact (minus porosity) = x³ - 0.18x³ = 0.82x³ cm³

The volume of the sintered compact = 2³ = 8 cm³
The density of the sintered ceramic = mass/volume
The mass of the sintered compact = 6.60 g/cm³ * 8 cm³ = 52.8 g

The density of the theoretical ceramic = mass/volume
The mass of the theoretical ceramic in the green compact = 6.76g/cm³ * 0.82x³ cm³ 

Since the mass of the theoretical ceramic and the mass of the sintered compact should be the same, we equate the two masses:

6.76 g/cm³ * 0.82x³ cm³ = 52.8 g
5.54x³ = 52.8
x³ = 9.53
x = 9.53^(1/3)
x ≈ 2.12 cm

So, the required side of the cubic green compact is approximately 2.12 cm.

Answer: [2.12]
