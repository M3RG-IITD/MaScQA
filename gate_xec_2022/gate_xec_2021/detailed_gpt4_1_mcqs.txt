We are given a two-component system (A and B) and are asked to find the condition for α and β phases to be in equilibrium at constant temperature and pressure. Let us analyze each option one by one.

A) Entropy of the system should be maximum
In general, for any system to be in a state of equilibrium, the total entropy should be maximum. However, the entropy criterion is not sufficient to describe the equilibrium condition in a two-component system at constant temperature and pressure. So, this option is not correct.

B) Gibbs energy of the system should be minimum and $(𝜇_𝐴)^𝛼$ = $(𝜇_B)^𝛼$ , $(𝜇_𝐴)^𝛽$ = $(𝜇_B)^𝛽$
The minimum Gibbs energy criterion is essential for determining equilibrium conditions. However, the equal chemical potential conditions given in this option are relating A in α phase with B in α phase, and A in β phase with B in β phase, which is incorrect. So, this option is also not correct.

C) Gibbs energy of the system should be minimum and $(𝜇_𝐴)^𝛼$ = $(𝜇_A)^𝛽$ , $(𝜇_B)^𝛼$ = $(𝜇_B)^𝛽$
For a two-component system at constant temperature and pressure, the condition for equilibrium between the α and β phases is that the chemical potential of each component A and B in both phases should be equal. That is, $(𝜇_𝐴)^𝛼$ = $(𝜇_A)^𝛽$ , $(𝜇_B)^𝛼$ = $(𝜇_B)^𝛽$. Additionally, the Gibbs free energy should be minimum for the system to be in equilibrium. This option satisfies both criteria. So, this option is correct.

D) Helmholtz energy should be minimum
For equilibrium at constant temperature and volume, the Helmholtz energy should be minimum. However, we are given that the system is at constant temperature and pressure, so this criterion is not applicable. Thus, this option is not correct.

Hence, the correct condition for α and β phases to be in equilibrium in a two-component system at constant temperature and pressure is:

[minimum Gibbs energy of the system and $(𝜇_𝐴)^𝛼$ = $(𝜇_A)^𝛽$ , $(𝜇_B)^𝛼$ = $(𝜇_B)^𝛽$]
