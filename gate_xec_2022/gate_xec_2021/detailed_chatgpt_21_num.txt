We can start by using the definition of porosity, which is the percentage of void space in a material:

Porosity = (V_v / V_t) x 100%

where:
- V_v: volume of voids or pores
- V_t: total volume of the material

We know that the green compact has 18% porosity, so we can write:

18% = (V_v / V_gc) x 100%

where V_gc is the volume of the green compact.

Solving for V_v, we get:

V_v = 0.18 x V_gc

We also know that the density of the sintered ceramic is:

density = mass / volume

where mass is the mass of the sintered cube and volume is the volume of the sintered cube.

Using the side length of 2 cm, we can calculate the volume of the sintered cube:

V_sintered = (2 cm)^3 = 8 cm^3

We can also calculate the mass of the sintered cube using the density:

6.60 g/cm^3 = mass / 8 cm^3

mass = 52.8 g

Now, we can use the definition of density to relate the mass and volume of the green compact:

density = mass_gc / V_gc

where mass_gc is the mass of the green compact and V_gc is the volume of the green compact.

We can rearrange this equation to solve for V_gc:

V_gc = mass_gc / density

We know that the theoretical density of the ceramic is 6.76 $gcm^(−3)$, so we can use this value to calculate the volume of the green compact:

V_gc = mass_gc / 6.76 gcm^(−3)

Next, we can express the volume of the green compact in terms of the porosity:

V_gc = V_sintered / (1 - Porosity)

Substituting the expressions we have derived for V_v and V_gc, we can write:

V_sintered / (1 - 0.18) = mass_gc / 6.76 gcm^(−3)

Solving for mass_gc, we get:

mass_gc = (V_sintered / 0.82) x (1 / 6.76 gcm^(−3))

mass_gc = 0.178 kg

Finally, we can use the density equation again to relate the mass and volume of the green compact, but this time we want to solve for the side length:

density = mass_gc / V_gc

V_gc = (side_length)^3 x (1 - Porosity)

Substituting the expressions we have derived, we get:

0.178 kg / V_gc = 6.76 gcm^(−3)

V_gc = (side_length)^3 x 0.82

Solving for side_length, we get:

side_length = (V_gc / 0.82)^(1/3)

Plugging in the expressions we have derived, we get:

side_length = [(0.178 kg / 6.76 gcm^(−3)) / 0.82]^(1/3)

side_length = 1.111 cm (rounded to 3 decimal places)

Therefore, the required side of the cubic green compact is 1.11 cm (rounded to 2 decimal places).
