We are given the mass of the magnet, $m = 50$ g, the magnetic moment, $M = 4.2 \times 10^{-7}$ $Am^2$, and the density, $\rho = 7.2$ g $cm^{-3}$.

The magnetic moment of a magnet is defined as the product of its pole strength and the distance between its poles. Mathematically, we can write:

$M = m \times \frac{B}{2} \times l$

where $B$ is the magnetic field strength and $l$ is the length of the magnet.

We can rearrange this equation to find the magnetic field strength:

$B = \frac{2M}{ml}$

The intensity of magnetization, $I$, is defined as the magnetic moment per unit volume. Mathematically, we can write:

$I = \frac{M}{V}$

where $V$ is the volume of the magnet.

We can relate the mass, density and volume of the magnet as follows:

$m = \rho \times V$

$V = \frac{m}{\rho}$

Substituting this expression for $V$ into the equation for $I$, we get:

$I = \frac{M}{\frac{m}{\rho}} = \frac{\rho M}{m}$

Substituting the expression for $B$ into the equation for $M$, we get:

$M = \frac{1}{2} B \times m \times l$

Substituting this expression for $M$ into the equation for $I$, we get:

$I = \frac{\rho}{2} \times \frac{B \times l}{m}$

Substituting the given values, we get:

$I = \frac{7.2}{2} \times \frac{\frac{2 \times 4.2 \times 10^{-7}}{50 \times 10^{-3}}}{5 \times 10^{-2}}$

Simplifying, we get:

$I = 0.151$ $Am^{-1}$ (rounded off to 3 decimal places)

Therefore, the intensity of magnetization is 0.151 $Am^{-1}$.
