As the composite is heated, the layers will expand differently due to differences in thermal expansion coefficients. This will cause the composite to deform. 

Based on the image, it appears that edge XY will bow outwards (option C), while edge YZ will bow inwards (option A).

Correct answer: 
- Edge XY: bows outwards (option C)
- Edge YZ: bows inwards (option A)
