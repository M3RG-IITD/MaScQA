To find the required side of the cubic green compact, we first need to understand the relationship between the green compact and the sintered ceramic. The green compact has a certain amount of porosity, so we will need to account for this when calculating its dimensions. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. Determine the volume of the sintered ceramic.
2. Determine the volume of the green compact, accounting for porosity.
3. Find the ratio of the volumes of the green compact vs. the sintered ceramic.
4. Calculate the required side of the green compact, given the ratio and the side of the sintered ceramic.

Step 1: Determine the volume of the sintered ceramic
Given that the sintered cube has a side of 2 cm, its volume can be calculated as follows:
Volume = side^3 = (2 cm)^3 = 8 cm³

Step 2: Determine the volume of the green compact, accounting for porosity
Green compact has 18 volume percent porosity, which means it has 82% solid material by volume. If 'x' is the volume of the green compact, then 0.82x is the volume of solid material in it. Since the densities of the green compact and sintered ceramic are related only to their solid parts, we can write the following equation:

Theoretical density × Solid volume (green compact) = Sintered density × Volume (sintered ceramic)
6.76 g/cm³ × 0.82x = 6.60 g/cm³ × 8 cm³

Step 3: Find the ratio of the volumes of the green compact vs. the sintered ceramic
Solving the above equation for x, we get:

x = (6.60 g/cm³ × 8 cm³) / (6.76 g/cm³ × 0.82) ≈ 9.79 cm³

Step 4: Calculate the required side of the green compact, given the ratio and the side of the sintered ceramic
Since the volume of a cube is side^3, we can find the required side of the green compact (let's call it 's') by taking the cube root of its volume:

s = (9.79 cm³)^(1/3) ≈ 2.14 cm

The required side of the cubic green compact is approximately 2.14 cm (rounded off to 2 decimal places).
