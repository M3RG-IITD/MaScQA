The Vickers hardness test is used to determine the hardness of materials by measuring the size of the indentation left after applying a known load. It uses a square-base diamond pyramid indenter with an included angle of 136° between the opposite faces.

Given:
Load on the indenter, P = 10 kg
Average length of diagonals of the square indentation, d = 0.5 mm
Included angle between opposite faces, α = 136°

Step 1: Calculate the area of square indentation.
The area of the square indentation can be calculated using the length of the diagonals. Since the indentation is a square, the diagonals are equal in length, and they bisect each other at 90°.

Let the side of the square indentation be 'a'. Then, applying the Pythagorean theorem to the right triangles formed by the diagonals:

a^2 + a^2 = d^2
2a^2 = d^2
a^2 = d^2 / 2

Now, substituting the given value of d:

a^2 = (0.5)^2 / 2
a^2 = 0.125
a = √0.125 = 0.3536 mm

The area of the square indentation (Asq) is:
Asq = a^2 = 0.125 mm^2

Step 2: Calculate the area of the diamond pyramid's face.
Since the base of the diamond pyramid is square, its faces are isosceles triangles. We can use trigonometric methods to find the area of one face of the pyramid.

Let the face's height be 'h' and the base be 'a'. half base of the face (b) = a / 2. Then,
tan(α/2) = (a/2) / h

Now, substituting the given value of α and solving for h:

tan(68) = (a / 2) / h
h = (a / 2) * cot(68)
h = (0.3536 / 2) * cot(68) = 0.0993 mm

Now, the area of one face of the diamond pyramid (Aface) is:
Aface = 0.5 * a * h = 0.5 * 0.3536 * 0.0993 = 0.0175 mm^2 

Step 3: Calculate the Vickers hardness.
Vickers hardness (HV) is defined as the load applied divided by the indentation area. In this scenario, the area of indentation is the area of one face of the indenter:

HV = Load / Aface
HV = (10 kg) / (0.0175 mm^2)
HV = 571.43 kg mm^(-2)

Rounding off to the nearest integer, we get the Vickers hardness as:

HV = 571 kg mm^(-2)

So, the Vickers hardness in kg mm^(-2) is [571].
