Firstly, we will calculate the surface area of the indentation. As it is a square indentation, the area can be calculated using the average length of the diagonals.

A square with diagonal length $d$ has an area of $A = \frac{d^2}{2}$.

Given the average length of diagonals, $d = 0.5 \ mm$, the indentation area, $A$, is:
$A= \frac{(0.5)^2}{2} = \frac{0.25}{2} = 0.125 \ mm^2$.

Now, we'll calculate the projected area of the indentation made by the indenter, given that the indenter has an angle of $136°$ between the opposite faces of the pyramid. To simplify, we'll use half the angle, $\frac{136}{2} = 68°$.

Since it is a pyramid, the cross-section of the pyramid forms an isosceles triangle. Using trigonometry, we can calculate the height, $h$, of the pyramid using the angle and base, $b$, of one triangle, where $b = d$.

$\tan{\frac{\angle 1}{2}} = \frac{b}{2h}$, where $\angle 1 = 68°$. Therefore,
$h = \frac{b}{2\tan{\left(\frac{\angle 1}{2}\right)}}$

$h = \frac{0.5}{2\tan{34°}} = 0.5 / 2(0.6745) \approx 0.37 \ mm$.

Now, we can calculate the total contact area of the indenter using the area of a square pyramid formula:

$A_{pyramid} = \frac{b_\text{base} \times h_\text{height}}{3}$, where $b_\text{base} = A$, and $h_\text{height} = h$.

$A_{pyramid} = \frac{0.125 \times 0.37}{3} \approx 0.0154 \ mm^2$.

Finally, we can calculate the Vickers hardness by dividing the applied load by the area of the pyramid:

$HV = \frac{F}{A_{pyramid}}$, where $F = 10 \ kg$ and $A_{pyramid} \approx 0.0154 \ mm^2$. 

$HV \approx \frac{10}{0.0154} \approx \boxed{649} \ kg \ mm^{−2}$.
