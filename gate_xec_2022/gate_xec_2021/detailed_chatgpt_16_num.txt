Let's assume that we have 'x' wt.% of A in the alloy. Therefore, the wt.% of B in the alloy will be (100 - x).

Now, we know that the wt.% of A in α phase is 70% and the wt.% of A in β phase is 20%. Using the overall ratio of α to β phases, we can write:

(Weight percentage of α phase)/(Weight percentage of β phase) = 4

So, we can assume that the weight percentage of α phase is 4k and the weight percentage of β phase is k (since the ratio is 4:1). Therefore, we have:

4k(0.7) + k(0.2) = x   [Total weight percentage of A in the alloy is x]

Simplifying the above equation, we get:

2.8k + 0.2k = x

3k = x

So, the weight percentage of A in the alloy is 3x and the weight percentage of B in the alloy is (100 - 3x).

Now, using the law of conservation of mass, we can write:

Weight percentage of A in the alloy = Weight percentage of A in α phase + Weight percentage of A in β phase

or

3x = 4k(0.7) + k(0.2)

Simplifying the above equation, we get:

3x = 3k

x = k

So, the weight percentage of A in the alloy is k and the weight percentage of B in the alloy is (100 - k).

Rounding off to the nearest integer, we get:

The wt.% of B in the alloy is 80%.

Hence, the answer is:
- 80
