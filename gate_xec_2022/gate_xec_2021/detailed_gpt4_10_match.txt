To solve this question, we need to understand each term in Column I and match it with the appropriate term in Column II.

Column I:
(P) Secondary electrons: These are low-energy electrons generated by the primary electron beam's interaction with the sample's atoms. Secondary electrons are used to generate high-resolution images of sample surfaces and provide information about topography.

(Q) Backscattered electrons: These are higher energy electrons that are reflected or scattered back from the sample surface. They are used to distinguish between chemically distinct phases in a sample since they are more sensitive to atomic number differences.

(R) Characteristic X-rays: These are X-rays emitted by a sample when an incident high-energy electron beam ejects an electron from its inner shell, causing another electron to fill the vacancy and release energy in the form of an X-ray. Characteristic X-rays are used to analyze the chemical composition of a sample.

(S) Diffracted backscattered electrons: These are backscattered electrons that undergo diffraction within the crystalline structure of the sample. They can provide information about the crystallographic orientation of grains in the sample.

Column II:
(1) Crystallographic orientation of grains
(2) Failure analysis of fractured surfaces
(3) Chemical composition analysis
(4) Distinguishing chemically distinct phases

Now, we can match each term in Column I with the appropriate term in Column II:

- (P) Secondary electrons should be matched with (2) Failure analysis of fractured surfaces, as they provide information about topography and surface features.
- (Q) Backscattered electrons should be matched with (4) Distinguishing chemically distinct phases, as they are sensitive to atomic number differences and can distinguish different phases in a sample.
- (R) Characteristic X-rays should be matched with (3) Chemical composition analysis since they provide information about the elemental composition of a sample.
- (S) Diffracted backscattered electrons should be matched with (1) Crystallographic orientation of grains, as they provide information about the crystal structure and orientation of grains.

This gives us the correct answer:
[(P-2); (Q-4); (R-3); (S-1)] which corresponds to option (B).
