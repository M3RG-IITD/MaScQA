The equation for Gibbs free energy change for homogeneous nucleation is given by:

∆$G_(hom)$ = $\frac{16\pi}{3}$ $r_c^3$ $\Delta G_v$ $\frac{(∆G_v+RTln(S))}{A_\beta}$

where $r_c$ is the critical radius, $\Delta G_v$ is the volume free energy change, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, S is the saturation ratio, and $A_\beta$ is the interfacial area per unit volume for the $\alpha$-$\beta$ interface.

Similarly, the equation for Gibbs free energy change for heterogeneous nucleation is given by:

$∆G_(het)$ = $\frac{4π}{3}$ $r_c^3$ $\Delta G_v$ + $4π$ $r_c^2$ $γ_{αβ}$ $cos(θ)$ + $4π$ $r_c^2$ $γ_{βδ}$

where $γ_{αβ}$ is the interfacial energy between $\alpha$ and $\beta$ phases, $γ_{βδ}$ is the interfacial energy between $\beta$ and $\delta$ phases, and θ is the contact angle between the $\beta$ particle and the substrate.

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

$∆G_(hom)$ = $\frac{16π}{3}$ $r_c^3$ $\Delta G_v$ $\frac{(∆G_v+RTln(S))}{0.3}$        ...(1)

$∆G_(het)$ = $\frac{4π}{3}$ $r_c^3$ $\Delta G_v$ + $4π$ $r_c^2$ $γ_{αβ}$ $cos(θ)$ + $4π$ $r_c^2$ $γ_{βδ}$

$∆G_(het)$ = $\frac{4π}{3}$ $r_c^3$ $\Delta G_v$ + $4π$ $r_c^2$ (0.4) $(cos(θ))$ + $4π$ $r_c^2$ (0.02)           ...(2)

Dividing equation (2) by equation (1), we get:

$\frac{∆G_(het)}{∆G_(hom)}$ = $\frac{\frac{4π}{3}$ $r_c^3$ $\Delta G_v$ + $4π$ $r_c^2$ (0.4) $(cos(θ))$ + $4π$ $r_c^2$ (0.02)}{$\frac{16π}{3}$ $r_c^3$ $\Delta G_v$ $\frac{(∆G_v+RTln(S))}{0.3}$}

Simplifying the above equation, we get:

$\frac{∆G_(het)}{∆G_(hom)}$ = $\frac{0.4cos(θ)+0.02(\frac{3}{8πr_c∆G_v})}{\frac{(∆G_v+RTln(S))}{0.3}}$

At equilibrium, the system will minimize the Gibbs free energy, which means that the value of $cos(θ)$ can be calculated using Young's equation:

$cos(θ)$ = $\frac{γ_{βδ}-γ_{αβ}}{γ_{αδ}}$

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

$cos(θ)$ = $\frac{0.02-0.4}{0.3}$ = -1.26

This value is negative, which means that the $\beta$ particle will not form on the substrate. Therefore, there is no value of $\frac{∆G_(het)}{∆G_(hom)}$ that can be calculated.

Answer: There is no value of $\frac{∆G_(het)}{∆G_(hom)}$ that can be calculated.
