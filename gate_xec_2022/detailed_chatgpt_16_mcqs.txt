When a diffusional transformation occurs, β precipitates grow in an α matrix. Increasing degree of undercooling means that the temperature is lowered even further below the equilibrium temperature, which creates more thermodynamic driving force for transformation. Now, let's consider each statement.

A) Rate of transformation first increases and then decreases
- This statement is not correct because as the temperature decreases, the driving force for transformation increases. Therefore, the rate of transformation should increase monotonically.

B) Rate of transformation first decreases and then increases
- This statement is also not correct for the same reason as A. The rate of transformation should increase monotonically.

C) Thermodynamic driving force increases monotonically
- This statement is true. As the temperature decreases, the thermodynamic driving force for transformation increases.

D) Mobility of atoms in α matrix remains unchanged
- This statement is not correct because as the temperature decreases, the mobility of atoms in the α matrix also decreases due to reduction of thermal energy. This can affect the rate of transformation, but it does not change the fact that the rate should increase monotonically.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
- Thermodynamic driving force increases monotonically
