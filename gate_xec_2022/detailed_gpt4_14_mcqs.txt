To answer this question, we need to understand the aging process of an Al-Cu alloy and how its hardness changes during this process.

Aging is a heat treatment process that results in the precipitation of small parts of a solute-rich phase in a matrix. The Al-Cu alloy consists of aluminum and copper (1 to 4 wt.% Cu) and forms a particular phase called Guinier-Preston (GP) zones below the solvus temperature.

Below we outline the important stages in the aging process of the Al-Cu alloy:

1. Quenching: The Al-Cu alloy is heated above the solvus temperature (generally around 500°C) to form a single-phase solid solution, and then rapidly cooled (quenched) in water or another suitable medium. This process reduces the mobility of atoms and "freezes" the solid solution structure.

2. Natural aging: This occurs at room temperature after quenching. Cu atoms start to diffuse and form clusters or GP zones. These zones are the precursors of the second phase and increase the hardness of the alloy. Therefore, the initial stage of natural aging corresponds to an increase in hardness, following option (D).

3. Artificial aging: Al-Cu alloys can be artificially aged by heating them to a specific temperature (usually between 150°C and 200°C) for a certain period. This promotes further Cu diffusion and growth of GP zones, as well as the formation of a more stable second phase called θ' (theta-prime). The alloy's hardness continues to increase during the initial stages of artificial aging, supporting option (D).

4. Overaging: As the artificial aging process continues, the GP zones and the θ' phase can coarsen and eventually transform into the less coherent and less hard θ phase (Al2Cu). This stage is called overaging and results in a decrease in hardness. Thus, the overall process follows the pattern of option (C).

5. Maximum hardness: There is a critical point in the aging process at which the hardness of the Al-Cu alloy reaches its maximum value. This point corresponds to the best balance between the size and number of precipitates, as well as the level of coherency between the precipitates and the matrix. Once this peak hardness is reached, the hardness starts to decrease due to overaging, corresponding to option (C) again.

Based on the stages discussed above, the hardness of an Al-Cu alloy during the aging process follows a pattern of first increasing and then decreasing, which corresponds to option (C). Therefore, the correct answer is:

[option (C)]
