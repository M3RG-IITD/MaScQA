To solve this problem, we will first determine the cell potential for the unknown reaction against Li(+)/Li and Zn(2+)/Zn reference electrodes. Then, we will use these potentials to calculate the potential of the unknown reaction against the Zn(2+)/Zn reference electrode.

Step 1:
The given cell potentials for Li(+)/Li and Zn(2+)/Zn are:

E°(Li(+)/Li) = -3.04 V
E°(Zn(2+)/Zn) = -0.77 V

Step 2:
The given cell potential of the unknown reaction against the Li(+)/Li reference electrode is:

E°(Unknown/Li(+)) = +4.50 V

Step 3:
Now let's find the cell potential of the unknown reaction against the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE):

Since standard cell potential is the difference between the cell potential of the unknown reaction and the reference electrode, we have:

E°(Unknown/SHE) = E°(Unknown/Li(+)) - E°(Li(+)/Li)

Substitute the given values from Step 1 and 2:

E°(Unknown/SHE) = 4.50 - (-3.04)
E°(Unknown/SHE) = 7.54 V

Step 4:
Now let's find the potential of the unknown reaction against the Zn(2+)/Zn reference electrode:

E°(Unknown/Zn(2+)) = E°(Unknown/SHE) - E°(Zn(2+)/Zn)

Substitute the values from Step 1 and 3:

E°(Unknown/Zn(2+)) = 7.54 - (-0.77)
E°(Unknown/Zn(2+)) = 8.31 V

Step 5:
Now, we round off our answer to two decimal places:

E°(Unknown/Zn(2+)) ≈ 8.31 V

Thus, the potential of the unknown reaction against the $Zn^(2+)$/Zn reference electrode is approximately 8.31 V.

Answer: [8.31]
