Let's first assign some variables:

wtAα = weight percentage of A in phase α
wtBα = weight percentage of B in phase α

wtAβ = weight percentage of A in phase β
wtBβ = weight percentage of B in phase β


xαA = mole fraction of A in phase α
xαB = mole fraction of B in phase α

xβA = mole fraction of A in phase β
xβB = mole fraction of B in phase β

mA = atomic mass of A
mB = atomic mass of B

From given information,
(i) wtAα = wtBα (equal weight percentages of A and B in phase α)

(ii) xβA = 2 * xβB (Phase β has twice the mole fraction of A compared to B)

(iii) equal amounts of α and β means equal moles of both phases

(iv) mA = 2 * mB (Atomic mass of A is twice that of B)

Now, let's use these relationships to get the mole fraction of A in the resultant two-phase mixture. Since the amounts of α and β are equal, the weight percentages of the resultant mixture can be calculated as follows:

wtA = 0.5 * wtAα + 0.5 * wtAβ

Similarly, for B,

wtB = 0.5 * wtBα + 0.5 * wtBβ

Now, we can calculate the mole fractions in terms of weights as follows:

xαA = (wtAα * wtα) / (mA * wtα)
xαB = (wtBα * wtα) / (mB * wtα)

Recall that wtAα = wtBα in phase α:

xαA + xαB = 1

Now, let's use the relationship wtAα = wtBα to find the mole fractions in phase α:

xαA = (0.5 * wtA) / (2 * mB)
xαB = (0.5 * wtB) / mB

xαA + xαB = 1

For phase β, mole fractions:

xβA = (wtAβ * wtβ) / (mA * wtβ)
xβB = (wtBβ * wtβ) / (mB * wtβ)

Recall that xβA = 2 * xβB:

xβA + xβB = 1

Now, we can use the relationship xβA = 2 * xβB to find the mole fractions in phase β:

xβA = (0.5 * wtA) / mA
xβB = (0.5 * wtB) / (2 * mB)

xβA + xβB = 1

Now, we can find the mole fraction of A in the resultant two-phase mixture by combining the mole fractions from both phases:

x_total_A = (0.5 * (xαA + xβA)) / ((0.5 * (xαA + xβA)) + (0.5 * (xαB + xβB)))

But since xαA + xαB = xβA + xβB = 1:

x_total_A = 0.5 * (xαA + xβA)

Now we can substitute the expressions for xαA and xβA from previous equations:

x_total_A = 0.5 * ((0.5 * wtA) / (2 * mB) + (0.5 * wtA) / mA)

Now we know wtA = wtAα + wtAβ = (0.5 * wtAα + 0.5 * wtAβ):

x_total_A = 0.5 * ((0.5 * (0.5 * wtAα + 0.5 * wtAβ)) / (2 * mB) + (0.5 * (0.5 * wtAα + 0.5 * wtAβ)) / mA)

Now, we know that mA = 2*mB, and let's denote k = 0.5*(wtAα + wtAβ):

x_total_A = 0.5 * (0.5 * k / mB + 0.5 * k / (2 * mB))

Since we know the weights sum to 1, we can substitute for k and simplify the expression:

x_total_A = 0.5 * (0.5 * (1 - wtBα - wtBβ)/mB + 0.5 * (1 - wtBα - wtBβ)/(2*mB))

Now cancel out mB:

x_total_A = 0.5 * (0.5 * (1 - wtBα - wtBβ) + 0.5 * (1 - wtBα - wtBβ)/2)

x_total_A = 0.75 - 0.375 * (wtBα + wtBβ)

We know that wtBα and wtBβ add up to wtB = wtA as wtAα = wtBα:

x_total_A = 0.75 - 0.375 * (wtA)

Now we know that the total composition has equal amounts of A and B:

0.5 = 0.75 - 0.375 * (wtA)
0.25 = 0.375 * (wtA)
wtA = 0.6667 (rounded to 4 decimal places)

Now we can substitute this back to find the mole fraction of A in the two-phase mixture:

x_total_A = 0.75 - 0.375 * (0.6667) = 0.50005 (rounded to 5 decimal places)

Now we round off to one decimal place:

x_total_A ≈ 0.5

The mole fraction of A in the resultant two-phase mixture is approximately [0.5].
