An intrinsic semiconductor is a pure semiconductor material which has no impurities in it. In an intrinsic semiconductor, the electrical conductivity is due to the presence of intrinsic carriers (i.e., electrons and holes generated by thermal excitation).

Now, the electrical conductivity of intrinsic semiconductor depends on temperature and pressure. Therefore, among the given options:

(A) Electrical conductivity increases with increasing temperature and pressure - This is not true as the electrical conductivity of intrinsic semiconductor increases with increasing temperature but decreases with increasing pressure.

(B) Electrical conductivity increases with increasing temperature and decreasing pressure - This is also not true as the electrical conductivity of intrinsic semiconductor increases with increasing temperature but decreases with decreasing pressure.

(C) Electrical conductivity increases with decreasing temperature and increasing pressure - This is again not true as the electrical conductivity of intrinsic semiconductor decreases with decreasing temperature and increasing pressure.

(D) Electrical conductivity increases with decreasing temperature and pressure - This is not true either as the electrical conductivity of intrinsic semiconductor decreases with decreasing temperature but increases with increasing pressure.

Thus, none of the given options is correct.

The correct statement for an intrinsic semiconductor is:

(E) Electrical conductivity increases with increasing temperature but is not affected by pressure.
