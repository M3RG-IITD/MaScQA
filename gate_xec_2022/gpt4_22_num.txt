To find the lattice parameter of the face-centered cubic crystal, we can use Bragg's Law formula:

nλ = 2d * sin(θ)

Where:
n = order of reflection (in this case, 1)
λ = wavelength of the X-ray beam (1.54 Å)
d = interplanar distance
θ = angle between the incident and reflected rays (2𝜃 is given to be 45°, so 𝜃 = 22.5°)

For an FCC crystal, the third peak corresponds to the 220 plane. Therefore, interplanar distance d can be calculated using the following formula for the FCC lattice:

d = a / sqrt(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)

Where:
a = lattice parameter
h, k, l = indices of the plane (220 plane in this case)

Substitute the indices into the formula:

d = a / sqrt(2^2 + 2^2 + 0^2)
d = a / sqrt(8)
d = a / (2 * sqrt(2))

Now, substitute d and other values into Bragg's Law formula:

1 * 1.54 Å = 2 * (a / (2 * sqrt(2))) * sin(22.5°)

Rearrange to solve for a:

a = (1.54 Å * 2 * sqrt(2)) / (2 * sin(22.5°))

Calculate the lattice parameter:

a ≈ 3.98 Å

So, the lattice parameter of the crystal is approximately 3.98 Å. The answer should be written inside a list as [3.98].
