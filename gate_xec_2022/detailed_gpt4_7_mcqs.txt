Before we evaluate the statements, let us first define each term:

1. Vickers microhardness (HV) is a measure of the hardness of a material, which is its resistance to deformation, indentation, or penetration. A higher value indicates a harder material.
2. Young's modulus (also known as the elastic modulus) is a measure of the material's ability to deform elastically when stress is applied. A higher value indicates a stiffer material.
3. Yield strength is the stress at which a material begins to deform plastically. A higher value indicates a stronger material.
4. Scratch resistance refers to a material's resistance to damage from scraping or abrasive contact.
5. Ductility is the ability of a material to deform, usually through the drawing of the material into a thin wire, before it fractures. A higher value indicates a more ductile material.

Now, let us examine each statement one by one:

A) Young's modulus of A is greater than B:
Vickers microhardness measures the material's resistance to indentation, which is related to hardness but not necessarily directly to stiffness or the Young's modulus. We cannot conclude that the Young's modulus of A is greater than B based solely on the hardness.

B) Yield strength of A is greater than B:
Generally, harder materials tend to have a higher yield strength as they resist plastic deformation. However, this is not always the case, as different materials can have different hardness-yield strength relationships. Despite the likelihood, it is not guaranteed that material A has a greater yield strength than material B based on the hardness alone.

C) Scratch resistance of A is greater than B:
Harder materials usually offer more significant resistance to abrasive wear and scratching due to their higher resistance to deformation. It is reasonable to assume that the scratch resistance of material A is greater than material B since material A has a higher Vickers microhardness value.

D) Ductility of A is greater than B:
Generally, harder materials are less ductile because they are more resistant to plastic deformation. This would mean that ductility of material A is likely less than that of material B since material A has a higher Vickers microhardness value. 

In conclusion, the correct answer is:
