Given: 
- Third peak in the X-ray diffraction pattern
- Face-centered cubic crystal
- 2𝜃 value of 45°
- Wavelength of monochromatic X-ray beam = 1.54 Å

To find: Lattice parameter of the crystal

We know that for Face-centered cubic crystal, the third peak in the X-ray diffraction pattern corresponds to (220) plane. 

The formula for calculating the d-spacing of a crystal plane in a face-centered cubic structure is given by:

d = a/√2  where, 
d is the distance between two adjacent planes, 
a is the lattice parameter of the crystal.

Now, using Bragg's law, we know that:

nλ = 2d sin(θ)
where, n = order of reflection, λ = wavelength of X-ray, θ = angle of diffraction.

Here, we are considering first-order reflection, therefore n = 1. 

Substituting the given values in the Bragg's law equation, we get:

1.54 Å = 2 × (a/√2) × sin(45°/2)
=> a = (1.54 Å × √2)/(2 × sin(22.5°))

Using a calculator, 

a = 3.54 Å (rounded off to two decimal places)

Therefore, the lattice parameter of the face-centered cubic crystal is 3.54 Å.

Answer: [3.54 Å]
