Given: 
- A two-phase (α + β) mixture of an A-B binary system.
- Phase α has equal weight percentages of A and B.
- Phase β has twice the mole fraction of A compared to B.
- The two-phase mixture has equal amounts of α and β.
- Atomic mass of A is twice that of B.

To find: The mole fraction of A in the resultant two-phase mixture.

Solution:
Let us assume that we have 100 g of the two-phase mixture. Therefore, we have 50 g of phase α and 50 g of phase β.

From (i), we can say that phase α has 25 g of A and 25 g of B.
From (iii), we can say that phase β has 25 g of A and 25 g of B.

Let the mole fractions of A in phase α and phase β be x and 2x, respectively.

Using atomic mass of A is twice that of B we get,

Atomic weight of A/B = 2/1

From this, we can say that the molecular weight of A is twice that of B. Therefore, the molecular weight of A is 2x and the molecular weight of B is x.

The total molecular weight of the two-phase mixture can be calculated as

(molecular weight of A in phase α + molecular weight of B in phase α) + (molecular weight of A in phase β + molecular weight of B in phase β)

= [(2x)(1/2) + x(1/2)] + [(2x)(2/3) + x(1/3)]
= x + (8x/3)
= 11x/3

Now, using the given weights, we can write the following equation:

50g = (25g/x) + (25g/(2x))
50g = (50/3)(1/x)
x = 3/50 = 0.06 (approx.)

Therefore, the mole fraction of A in the resultant two-phase mixture is 0.06.
