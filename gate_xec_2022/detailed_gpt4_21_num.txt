To solve this problem, we will first understand the relationship between the transmitted light, absorption coefficient, and thickness of the glass material.

The fraction of transmitted light through the glass panel can be determined using the Beer-Lambert law:

$$
T = 10^{-αd},
$$

where:
- T is the fraction of light transmitted through the glass
- α is the absorption coefficient (in cm⁻¹)
- d is the thickness of the glass (in cm)

First, we need to convert the thickness of the glass panel from mm to cm:

$$
d = 5\,mm = 0.5\,cm
$$

Now we want to find the maximum and minimum fraction of light transmitted through the glass for the given range of absorption coefficients (0.3 cm⁻¹ to 1 cm⁻¹).

Let's start with the minimum absorption coefficient (0.3 cm⁻¹):

$$
T_{min} = 10^{-0.3(0.5)} = 10^{-0.15}
$$

Now let's calculate the fraction of light transmitted through the panel with maximum absorption coefficient (1 cm⁻¹):

$$
T_{max} = 10^{-1(0.5)} = 10^{-0.5}
$$

To find the ratio of the maximum to the minimum fraction of the light transmitted, we simply divide T_max by T_min:

$$
\frac{T_{max}}{T_{min}} = \frac{10^{-0.5}}{10^{-0.15}}
$$

Since both terms in the ratio are in the form of 10 raised to power, we can subtract the powers:

$$
\frac{T_{max}}{T_{min}} = 10^{(-0.15) - (-0.5)} = 10^{0.35}
$$

Let's round off the value of the ratio to two decimal places:

$$
\frac{T_{max}}{T_{min}} \approx 2.24
$$

So the ratio of the maximum to the minimum fraction of the light transmitted through the glass panel is approximately 2.24. 

Final Answer: [2.24]
