A continuous, aligned carbon fibre (CF) reinforced polymer composite with 30 vol% of CF and rest resin was designed for a specific application. The modulus of elasticity of CF is 170 GPa and that of the resin is 3.0 GPa. The modulus of elasticity for this composite in the direction of fibre alignment in GPa
