To solve this question, we need to analyze each statement given regarding the structure-property correlation in polymers:

(i) Polymers that are less coiled are more crystalline than those that are more coiled - This statement is true. In general, a polymer with a more linear and less coiled structure will have a higher degree of crystallinity. The reason behind this is that less coiled structures allow for greater regularity and close packing of polymer chains, which leads to more crystalline regions.

(ii) Branched polymers are more crystalline than the linear ones - This statement is false. Branched polymers usually have a lower degree of crystallinity as the branches disrupt the regular arrangement and close packing of polymer chains, thereby reducing the overall crystallinity.

(iii) Polymers with inter-chain interactions have higher glass transition temperature than those without inter-chain interactions - This statement is true. Polymers with strong inter-chain interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, or ionic interactions, require more energy to disrupt these interactions and to transition from the glassy state to the rubbery state. As a result, they have a higher glass transition temperature than polymers without inter-chain interactions.

(iv) Polymers with inter-chain interactions are more crystalline than those without inter-chain interactions - This statement is generally true. It is because the presence of inter-chain interactions enhances the regularity and orderliness of the polymer chains, leading to a greater degree of crystallinity.

Based on the analysis of the statements, the correct answer is (B) (i) and (iii).
