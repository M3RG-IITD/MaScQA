The first step is to calculate the molecular weight of a single repeat unit of polyethylene.

The molecular formula for polyethylene is (C2H4)n, where n is the number of repeat units. In this case, we know that there are two repeat units in each unit cell, so we can use n=2.

The molecular weight of a single repeat unit is:

(2 x 12.01 g/mol) + (4 x 1.008 g/mol) = 28.05 g/mol

Next, we need to calculate the volume occupied by a single repeat unit. Since we know the unit cell volume and the number of repeat units per unit cell (n=2), we can use the following equation:

Volume of repeat unit = Unit cell volume / number of repeat units per unit cell
Volume of repeat unit = 0.0933 nm^3 / 2
Volume of repeat unit = 0.04665 nm^3

Now we can convert the volume of a single repeat unit to units of cm^3:

Volume of repeat unit = 0.04665 nm^3 x (1 cm / 10^-7 nm)^3
Volume of repeat unit = 4.665 x 10^-22 cm^3

Finally, we can calculate the density of polyethylene as follows:

Density = (molecular weight / volume) x N_A x 10^-3

where N_A is Avogadro's number and 10^-3 is a conversion factor from g/nm^3 to g/cm^3.

Density = (28.05 g/mol / 4.665 x 10^-22 cm^3) x 6.023 x 10^23 repeat units/mol x 10^-3
Density = 0.938 g/cm^3

Therefore, the density of totally crystalline PE is 0.938 g/cm^3. 

Answer: 
- 0.938 g/cm^3
