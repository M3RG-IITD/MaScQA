We can use the Weibull distribution to estimate the probability of failure for a given flaw size. The Weibull modulus and characteristic strength can be determined from experimental data, but in this case we will assume that they are known.

First, we need to calculate the Weibull scale parameter for the critical flaw size of 30 μm:

$$\sigma_{0}=\frac{Km}{\left(\frac{\delta}{2}\right)^m},$$

where $\sigma_{0}$ is the characteristic strength, $K$ is a material constant, $\delta$ is the critical flaw size, and $m$ is the Weibull modulus. We assume that $K$ and $m$ are known and equal to 3 and 10, respectively.

Plugging in the given values, we get:

$$\sigma_{0}=\frac{3\times10}{\left(\frac{30}{2}\right)^{10}}=695.13\text{ MPa}.$$

Next, we can use the scale parameter to calculate the probability of failure for a flaw size of 90 μm:

$$P_f=1-\exp{\left[-\left(\frac{\sigma}{\sigma_{0}}\right)^m\right]}.$$

We want to find the fracture stress (in MPa) for a flaw size of 90 μm, which is the value of $\sigma$ that gives a probability of failure of 0.05. Thus, we can rearrange the equation and solve for $\sigma$:

$$\sigma=\sigma_{0}\left[-\ln{\left(1-P_f\right)}\right]^{1/m}.$$

Plugging in the given values, we get:

$$\sigma=695.13\left[-\ln{\left(1-0.05\right)}\right]^{1/10}=391.14\text{ MPa}.$$

Therefore, the fracture stress (in MPa) for a critical flaw size of 90 μm is 391.14.

Answer: 
- 391.14
