To answer this question, we need to analyze the properties of the composites given in column I and match them with the most suitable application in column II.

(P) Exfoliated silicates filled butyl rubber:
This composite has good elasticity, flexibility, and is light in weight. Among the given options, it is most suitable for application (4) Tennis balls.

(Q) Fiber reinforced aluminium alloy:
This composite has high strength, lightweight, and good stiffness. It finds its use in the automobile industry, especially where weight reduction and good mechanical properties are essential. So, it is most suitable for application (1) Automobile pistons.

(R) Silicon carbide whiskers reinforced alumina:
This composite has high hardness, wear resistance, and excellent cutting tool performance. It can be used for making cutting tools or inserts for machining. So, it is most suitable for application (5) Cutting tool inserts for machining.

(S) Carbon particles reinforced plastic composites:
This composite has high strength-to-weight ratio, good stiffness, and excellent thermal stability. It is suitable for use in sports equipment, where lightweight, good mechanical properties, and impact resistance are needed. So, it is most suitable for application (3) Ski boards.

Now, let's match the composites and their applications:

P - 4; Q - 1; R - 5; S - 3

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) P-4; Q-1; R-5; S-3.
