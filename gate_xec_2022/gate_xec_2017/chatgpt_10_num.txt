The molecular weight of ethylene is (2 x atomic weight of C) + (4 x atomic weight of H) = (2 x 12.01 g/mol) + (4 x 1.008 g/mol) = 28.05 g/mol.

One PE repeat unit contains two ethylene units, so the molecular weight of one repeat unit is 2 x 28.05 g/mol = 56.1 g/mol.

The number of repeat units in one unit cell can be calculated as follows:

Unit cell volume = volume of one repeat unit x number of repeat units

Number of repeat units = Unit cell volume / volume of one repeat unit = 0.0933 nm^3 / (56.1 g/mol / (6.023 x 10^23 repeat units/mol) x 1.0 x 10^-21 cm^3/nm^3) = 4.31 x 10^22 repeat units.

The mass of one unit cell can be calculated as follows:

Mass of one unit cell = molecular weight of one repeat unit x number of repeat units = 56.1 g/mol x 4.31 x 10^22 repeat units = 2.42 x 10^24 g.

The density of totally crystalline PE can be calculated as follows:

Density = mass of one unit cell / volume of one unit cell = 2.42 x 10^24 g / (0.0933 nm^3 x 1.0 x 10^-24 cm^3/nm^3) = 2.59 g/cm^3

Therefore, the density of totally crystalline PE will be 2.59 g/cm^3.

Answer: 
- 2.59 g/cm^3
