To find the number of oxygen vacancies present per mole of CeO₂ at 1000 K, we can use the Boltzmann distribution by the following formula:

n_i = N_A * exp(-ΔH / k_BT)

where n_i is the number of vacancies, ΔH is the enthalpy required to create a vacancy (4 eV), k_B is the Boltzmann constant (8.62 * 10^(-5) eV/K), T is the temperature (1000 K), and N_A is Avogadro's number (6.02 * 10^23 mole^(-1)).

First, let's convert ΔH from eV to Joules:

ΔH = 4 eV * (1.602 * 10^(-19) J/eV) = 6.408 * 10^(-19) J

Now, let's plug the values into the formula:

n_i = (6.02 * 10^23) * exp(- (6.408 * 10^(-19)) / (8.62 * 10^(-5) * 1000) )

n_i = (6.02 * 10^23) * exp(- (6.408 * 10^(-19)) / (8.62 * 10^(-5) * 1000) )

n_i = (6.02 * 10^23) * exp(-6.408 * 10^(-14) / 8.62 * 10^(-2) )

n_i = (6.02 * 10^23) * exp(-7.43 * 10^(-13))

n_i ≈ (6.02 * 10^23) * exp(-0)

n_i ≈ 6.02 * 10^23

As we can see, the number of oxygen vacancies present per mole of CeO₂ at 1000 K is very close to Avogadro's number but considering the approximation we made, the exact value will be slightly lower than that. Since the question asks for the nearest integer value, we can conclude that:

n_i ≈ 6.02 * 10^23 vacancies/mole

So, the answer is approximately [6.02 * 10^23].
