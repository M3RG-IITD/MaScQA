P: $Cu_{(0.5)}Al_{(0.5)}$ is an alloy composed of copper and aluminum. Both copper and aluminum have metallic bonding with each other, resulting in the alloy having metallic bonding.

Q: ZnS (zinc sulfide) is a compound composed of zinc and sulfur. Both zinc and sulfur are nonmetals, and they share electrons to form covalent bonding in ZnS.

R: $Na_2O$ (sodium oxide) is a compound composed of sodium and oxygen. Both sodium and oxygen are highly reactive elements, and they form an ionic bond in $Na_2O$.

S: $Li_4SiO_4$ (lithium silicate) is a compound composed of lithium, silicon, and oxygen. Lithium and oxygen have a large difference in electronegativity, so they form an ionic bond in Li4SiO4. Silicon and oxygen share electrons to form covalent bonding.

Based on the above explanations, the correct answer is (B) P - 3; Q - 4; R - 2; S - 1.
