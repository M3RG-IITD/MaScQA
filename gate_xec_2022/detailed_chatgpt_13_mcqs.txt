The given information are as follows:

- Two dog-bone samples of a Cualloy are tested under tension at room temperature to points “E” and “P”, respectively.
- Subsequently, they are unloaded completely and metallographically polished.
- Brinell hardness testing was performed in the gauge section of the samples.

There is no definite relationship between the tensile properties of a material and its hardness. Therefore, it cannot be concluded directly from the tensile test data that one sample is necessarily harder than the other.

For example, Sample 1 may have a higher tensile strength but a lower hardness than Sample 2, or vice versa. It is also possible that both samples have the same hardness value despite having different tensile properties.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) A conclusion about BHN of samples 1 and 2 cannot be made, with the provided information.
