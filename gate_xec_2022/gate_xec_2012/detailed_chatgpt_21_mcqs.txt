The atomic diameter (d) of chromium is given as 2.494 Å. 

The body-centered cubic (bcc) crystal structure can be visualized as a cube with atoms located at each corner and one atom at the center. 

Let's assume that the atoms are tightly packed in the bcc structure, which means that the atoms touch along the diagonal of the cube face. 

The diagonal of a cube face can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem: 

diagonal² = side² + side² 

Since there are two sides in a cube face, we can rewrite this as: 

diagonal² = 2(side²) 

The atomic diameter (d) of chromium can be related to the side of the cube (a) by: 

diagonal = 4d/√3 

Using these equations, we can solve for the lattice parameter (a): 

2(side²) = (4d/√3)² 

2(a²) = (4d/√3)² 

a = √[(4d/√3)² / 2] 

a = (2d/√3) 

Plugging in the value for d, we get: 

a = (2 x 2.494 Å) / √3 

a = 2.880 Å 

Therefore, the lattice parameter of chromium assuming tight atomic bonding is 2.880 Å, which corresponds to answer choice (B). 

The correct answer is:

(B) 2.880 Å
