We are given that the steel and aluminum bars have the same elastic strain. The elastic strain can be calculated using Hooke's Law, which states that stress is equal to Young's modulus multiplied by strain:

Stress = E * Strain

For the steel bar: 
Stress_steel = (20 kN) / (8 cm^2) = 2.5 kN/cm^2 (converted to N and mm for ease of calculation)
Elastic strain_steel = Stress_steel / E_steel = (2.5 kN/cm^2) / (200 GPa) 
= (2.5 * 10^3 N/mm^2) / (200 * 10^3 N/mm^2)
= (2.5 / 200) = 0.0125

Now, we can find the stress in the aluminum bar, knowing the elastic strain is the same:

Stress_Al = E_Al * Elastic strain_steel = 70 GPa * 0.0125
= 70 * 10^3 N/mm^2 * 0.0125
= 0.875 * 10^3 N/mm^2
= 0.875 kN/cm^2

To find the cross-sectional area of the aluminum bar, we can use the equation:

Area_Al = Load_Al / Stress_Al = (20 kN) / (0.875 kN/cm^2)
= 22.857 cm^2

Therefore, the cross-sectional area of the aluminum bar is approximately 22.86 $cm^2$. The correct answer is (D) 22.86 $cm^2$.
