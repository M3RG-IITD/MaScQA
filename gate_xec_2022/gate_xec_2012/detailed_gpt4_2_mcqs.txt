A Schottky defect in an ionic crystal is a type of point defect that occurs when oppositely charged ions (i.e., cations and anions) are missing from their regular positions in the crystal lattice. These defects are also called Schottky pairs, as they always occur in pairs to maintain the overall electrical neutrality of the crystal. Schottky defects are typically formed when a pair of adjacent anion and cation vacancies are created to minimize the electrostatic energy of the crystal.

Let's break down each option to better understand the nature of a Schottky defect:

(A) Cation vacancy:
This option suggests that only a cation is missing from the lattice site. However, the loss of only a charged ion would not maintain the overall electrical neutrality of the crystal. Therefore, this option is not a Schottky defect.

(B) Anion vacancy:
Similar to option A, this option indicates that only an anion is missing from the lattice site. As with A, the absence of only one charged ion would disturb the overall electrical neutrality of the crystal. Therefore, this option is not a Schottky defect as well.

(C) Cation and anion vacancy:
This option implies that both a cation and an anion are missing from their regular positions in the crystal lattice. Since a Schottky defect occurs in pairs of oppositely charged ions and their absence maintains the crystal's overall electrical neutrality, this option aligns with the definition of a Schottky defect.

(D) Cation and anion interstitial:
This option suggests that both a cation and an anion are not missing from their lattice sites but are instead placed in the interstitial spaces between lattice sites. This is a different type of point defect known as an interstitial defect, not a Schottky defect.

So, based on our analysis, the correct answer is:

[Cation and anion vacancy]
