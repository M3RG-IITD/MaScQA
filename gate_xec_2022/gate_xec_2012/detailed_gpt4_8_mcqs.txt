Microstrain is a measure of the local deformation of a crystalline material's lattice due to various factors such as lattice defects or dislocations. It can be evaluated using X-ray diffraction techniques. In X-ray diffraction, a beam of X-rays is directed towards a crystal, and the diffracted X-ray pattern is measured. The information about the crystal structure, lattice parameters, and lattice strains can be determined from this pattern.

In order to find the correct answer, let's examine each option one by one:

(A) Area and intensity
While the area and intensity of the peaks in X-ray diffraction pattern can provide information about the phase composition and crystal structure, they are not directly related to microstrain measurements. Thus, this option is not the correct choice for measuring microstrain.

(B) Position and area
Position of the peaks in X-ray diffraction pattern can be related to the lattice parameters and interplanar spacing. The shift in the position of peaks can provide information about the lattice strains that cause the change in interplanar spacing. However, the area of the peaks is related to the phase composition and crystal structure, not the microstrain. Therefore, this option is not the correct answer.

(C) Broadening and intensity
Broadening of the peaks in X-ray diffraction pattern can be attributed to various factors such as instrumental broadening, size broadening, and strain broadening. The strain broadening is due to the presence of lattice strains or microstrains within the crystalline material. By analyzing the peak broadening and considering the contribution of other factors, one can determine the microstrain within the crystal. Intensity of the peaks is mainly related to the structure factor and the phase composition of the material. Although it does not directly contribute to the microstrain measurement, the intensity needs to be considered to obtain accurate results. Therefore, this option is the correct answer for measuring microstrain.

(D) Position and broadening
Position of the peaks can provide information about the lattice strains; however, as stated before, the microstrain is mainly determined from the strain broadening of the peaks in X-ray diffraction pattern. So, while position is related to strain, this option is not as accurate as option C.

Hence, the correct answer for measuring microstrain using X-ray diffraction is (C) Broadening and intensity.

Answer: [(C) Broadening and intensity]
