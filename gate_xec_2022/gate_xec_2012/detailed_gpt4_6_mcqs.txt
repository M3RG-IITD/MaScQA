To determine which of the provided options is most suitable for an LED emitting at around 380 nm, we first need to understand the properties of direct and indirect bandgap materials and the concept of bandgaps in semiconductors.

A bandgap is an energy difference between the valence band and the conduction band in a semiconductor. The larger the bandgap, the greater the amount of energy required to move an electron from the valence band to the conduction band, resulting in the emission of higher energy (shorter wavelength) light.

Direct bandgap materials have a property that allows for efficient light emission as electrons transition from the conduction band directly to the valance band. In indirect bandgap materials, this transition is slower and less efficient, as it requires an additional momentum change via phonon interaction, leading to less efficient LEDs.

Now let's examine each option:

(A) Direct bandgap material with a small bandgap: This material would not be suitable since a small bandgap would emit low-energy (longer-wavelength) light, not the 380 nm required.

(B) Indirect bandgap material with a large bandgap: Although this material may have the right bandgap for emitting 380 nm light, the indirect nature of the bandgap would result in inefficient light emission.

(C) Direct bandgap material with a large bandgap: This material would be suitable for efficient light emission and could potentially have the correct bandgap to emit 380 nm light.

(D) Indirect bandgap material with a small bandgap: This material is not suitable since it has both inefficient light emission properties and is likely to emit low-energy (longer-wavelength) light due to the small bandgap.

Therefore, the most suitable material for an LED emitting at around 380 nm is a direct bandgap material with a large bandgap.

The correct answer is: [C]
