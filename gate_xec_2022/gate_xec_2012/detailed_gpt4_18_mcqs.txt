To find the volume % of pearlite for the 0.45 wt.% carbon steel just below 723°C, we need to apply the lever rule in the Fe-C phase diagram. 

The lever rule states that the fraction of a phase in a two-phase system can be found using the following relationship:

$$
w_1 = \frac{C_L-C_0}{C_L-C_S}
$$

$$
w_2 = \frac{C_0-C_S}{C_L-C_S}
$$

Where:
- $w_1$ is the weight fraction of phase 1
- $w_2$ is the weight fraction of phase 2
- $C_L$ is the concentration of solute in the liquid phase
- $C_S$ is the concentration of solute in the solid phase
- $C_0$ is the overall concentration of the solute in the system

In this case, we have the following information:

- $\gamma$ (austenite phase) has a 0.8 wt.% C
- The α (ferrite) phase has a 0.02 wt.% C
- $Fe_3C$ (cementite) has a 6.67 wt.% C

We are asked to find the volume % of pearlite, which is a combination of α (ferrite) and $Fe_3C$(cementite) phases. Thus, the concentrations we will use from the phase diagram are:

- $C_L$ = 6.67 wt.% C (cementite)
- $C_S$ = 0.02 wt.% C (ferrite)
- $C_0$ = 0.45 wt.% C (overall system)

Using the lever rule, we can find the weight fraction of the α (ferrite) and $Fe_3C$(cementite) phases:

$$
w_{Fe_3C} = \frac{0.45 - 0.02}{6.67 - 0.02} = \frac{0.43}{6.65} = 0.0647
$$

$$
w_\alpha = \frac{6.67 - 0.45}{6.67 - 0.02} = \frac{6.22}{6.65} = 0.9353
$$

Now, we will convert these weight fractions to volume fractions using the rule of mixtures:

$$
V_{Fe_3C} = \frac{w_{Fe_3C}\rho_{Fe_3C}}{w_{Fe_3C}\rho_{Fe_3C} + w_\alpha\rho_\alpha}
$$

We need the densities of the phases:

- The density of the α (ferrite) phase, $\rho_\alpha \approx 7.87 g/cm^3$
- The density of $Fe_3C$ (cementite) phase, $\rho_{Fe_3C} \approx 7.67 g/cm^3$

$$
V_{Fe_3C} = \frac{0.0647 \times 7.67}{0.0647 \times 7.67 + 0.9353 \times 7.87} = 0.4493
$$

The volume fraction of pearlite in the 0.45 wt.% carbon steel just below 723°C is 44.93%, which is approximately 44.9%.

Thus, the correct answer is (A) 44.9%.
