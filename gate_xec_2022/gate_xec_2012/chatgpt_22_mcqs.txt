We can use Bragg's Law to calculate the first diffraction peak position:

nλ = 2d sin(θ)

where n = 1 (first diffraction peak), λ = 1.54 Å (Cu Kα radiation), d is the interplanar spacing, and θ is the angle between the incident beam and the planes of atoms.

For bcc crystal structure, we know that the planes of atoms are (110) planes, and the interplanar spacing is given by:

d = a/√(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)

where a is the lattice constant, and h, k, l are the Miller indices for the planes. For (110) planes in bcc crystal, h = 1, k = 1, l = 0.

Substituting the values, we get:

d = 2.494 Å / √(1^2 + 1^2 + 0^2) = 1.770 Å

Substituting this value in Bragg's Law, we get:

sin(θ) = nλ / 2d = 1.54 Å / (2 x 1.770 Å) = 0.436

Taking the inverse sine of both sides, we get:

θ = 25.58°

Therefore, the closest answer choice is (B) 33.05°. 

Answer: (B) 33.05°.
