Magnetostriction is the property of a magnetic material to undergo a change in shape or size when subjected to a magnetic field. The strain produced in a magnetostrictive material is directly proportional to the strength of the magnetic field applied, making it an important property for applications such as sensors, actuators, and transducers.

(A) $Nd_2Fe_{14}B$ is a permanent magnet material known for its high magnetic energy product and excellent magnetic properties, but it is not a magnetostrictive material.

(B) $Fe_3O_4$ is a magnetic material known as magnetite and has a high magnetic susceptibility, but it is not a magnetostrictive material.

(C) $Cu_2MnAl$ is a Heusler alloy that exhibits a large magnetostriction, making it a promising material for various magnetic applications. It is an example of a ferromagnetic shape memory alloy, which has the additional benefit of being able to recover its original shape after being deformed.

(D) $ZnFe_2O_4$ is a ferrite material that is used in microwave devices and as a magnetic recording medium, but it is not a magnetostrictive material.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) $Cu_2MnAl$.
