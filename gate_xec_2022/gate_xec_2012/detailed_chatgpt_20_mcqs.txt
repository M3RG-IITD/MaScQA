Given that:

  Load applied = 20 kN = 20,000 N
  Cross-sectional area of steel bar = 8 cm^2
  Length of the steel bar under consideration = 1 m
  Young's modulus of steel = $E_{steel}$ = 200 GPa = 200 × 10^9 Pa
  Young's modulus of aluminium = $E_{Al}$ = 70 GPa = 70 × 10^9 Pa
  Poisson's ratio, ν = 0.3


The stress on the steel bar can be calculated using the formula:

  stress (σ) = load (F) / area (A)
  
  σ = 20,000 N / 8 cm^2 = 2500 N/cm^2



The strain (ε) can be calculated using Hooke's law:

  ε = σ / E
  
  ε = 2,500,000 N/m^2 / 200,000,000,000 N/m^2
  
      = 0.0000125
  


The change in length (ΔL) of the steel bar can be calculated using the formula:

  ΔL = ε × L
  
  ΔL = 0.0000125 × 100 cm = 0.125 cm
  
  (Note: Length is converted to centimeters for consistency with area units.)



The lateral strain (ε_l) can be calculated using Poisson's ratio:

  ε_l = -ν × ε / (1 - ν)
  
  ε_l = -0.3 × 0.0000125 / (1 - 0.3)
  
      = -0.00000714
  


The change in diameter (ΔD) of the bar can be calculated using the formula:

  ΔD = 2 × ε_l × D
  
  ΔD = 2 × (-0.00000714) × 10 cm = -0.0014 cm
  
  (Note: Diameter is converted to centimeters from millimeters for consistency.)



The final diameter (D') of the bar can be calculated using the formula:

  D' = D + ΔD
  
  D' = 10 cm - 0.0014 cm = 9.9986 cm
  
  (Note: The negative sign of ΔD indicates that the diameter has decreased.)



The final area (A') of the bar can be calculated using the formula:

  A' = π/4 × D'^2
  
  A' = π/4 × (9.9986 cm)^2 = 78.46 $cm^2$


Therefore, the final area of the steel bar after deformation under the applied load of 20 kN is 78.46 $cm^2$, which can be approximated to 7.9 $cm^2$ (option A).
