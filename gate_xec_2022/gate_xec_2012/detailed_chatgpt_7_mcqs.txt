The specific heat capacity of a material is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one unit mass of the material by one degree Celsius. It is a measure of the ability of a material to store thermal energy. The material with the lowest specific heat capacity at room temperature is the one that requires the least amount of heat to raise its temperature. 

To find the answer to this question, we need to compare the specific heat capacities of water, mercury, copper, and silver at room temperature. 

(A) Water has a very high specific heat capacity of 4.18 J/g째C at room temperature. It means that water requires a lot of heat to raise its temperature, and it can store a large amount of thermal energy. Therefore, water is not the material with the lowest specific heat capacity at room temperature.

(B) Mercury has a specific heat capacity of 0.14 J/g째C at room temperature. It means that mercury requires comparatively less heat to raise its temperature, which makes it a good conductor of heat. However, compared to copper and silver, mercury still has a higher specific heat capacity at room temperature. 

(C) Copper has a specific heat capacity of 0.39 J/g째C at room temperature. It requires more heat than mercury to raise its temperature but less than water. Copper is an excellent conductor of heat, and it is commonly used in heat sinks and cooling systems, which require high thermal conductivity.

(D) Silver has a specific heat capacity of 0.24 J/g째C at room temperature. It means that silver requires the least amount of heat to raise its temperature compared to water, mercury, and copper. Therefore, the material with the lowest specific heat capacity at room temperature is silver.

Correct answer: 

(D) Silver
