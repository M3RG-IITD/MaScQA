Column I  |  Column II
------------- | -------------
P. Titanium diboride | 3. Ultra high temperature material
Q. Molybdenum disilicide | 2. Furnace heating element
R. Hydroxyapatite | 5. Artificial bone implant
S. Nanocrystalline titanium oxide | 1. Photocatalyst

Explanation:

Titanium diboride is an ultra-high temperature material, which means it can withstand extremely high temperatures without melting. This makes it useful in applications such as high-speed cutting tools, as well as in rocket engines and space vehicles where heat resistance is important. Therefore, we match P with 3.

Molybdenum disilicide is often used as a heating element in high-temperature furnaces. It has a high melting point and excellent thermal stability, making it an ideal material for this application. Therefore, we match Q with 2.

Hydroxyapatite is a tough ceramic that is used as an artificial bone implant. It is a bioactive material that can bond directly to bone tissue, allowing for better integration and faster healing. Therefore, we match R with 5.

Nanocrystalline titanium oxide is a photocatalyst that can be used to remove pollutants from the air and water. It works by absorbing sunlight and using it to create free radicals that react with the pollutants, breaking them down into harmless compounds. Therefore, we match S with 1.

Hence, the correct match is option (A) P-3, Q-4, R-5, S-1.
