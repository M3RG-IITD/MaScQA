P. Scanning tunneling microscopy uses an atomically sharp tip to probe the surface of a material at the sub-Angstrom scale without requiring a vacuum. 

Q. Scanning electron microscopy uses backscattered electrons to create high-resolution images of the surface of a material. 

R. Transmission electron microscopy uses photoelectrons to produce an image of a material by transmitting a beam of electrons through a sample. 

S. Atomic force microscopy uses an atomically sharp tip to scan a surface and create a sub-Angstrom resolution image without requiring a vacuum. 

Matching these descriptions to the options presented, we get:

(A) P-4, Q-2, R-5, S-1 

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) P-4, Q-2, R-5, S-1.
