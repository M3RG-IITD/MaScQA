To solve this question, we will use Bragg's Law:

nλ = 2d sinθ

Where n is an integer representing the order of diffraction, λ is the wavelength of the radiation used (in this case, 1.54 Å for Cu Kα radiation), d is the distance between the planes of atoms in the crystal lattice, and θ is the diffraction angle.

Since we are asked to find the first diffraction peak position (2θ), we will use n = 1.

Step 1: Calculate the lattice parameter (a) for bcc structure

The lattice parameter (a) is related to the atomic diameter (D) for bcc structure as follows:

a = √3 * D / 2

Given the atomic diameter D = 2.494 Å, we can find the lattice parameter:

a = √3 * 2.494 Å / 2
a = 2.165 Å

Step 2: Calculate the interplanar distance (d)

For bcc structure, the interplanar distance d can be calculated using the following formula:

d = a / √(h² + k² + l²)

Where h, k, and l are Miller indices. For the first diffraction peak, we consider the lowest non-zero Miller indices, which are (1, 1, 1):

d = 2.165 Å / √(1² + 1² + 1²)
d = 2.165 Å / √3
d = 1.249 Å

Step 3: Calculate the diffraction angle (θ) using Bragg's Law

Now we can use Bragg's Law to find the diffraction angle:

λ = 2d sinθ

1.54 Å = 2 * 1.249 Å * sinθ
sinθ = 1.54 Å / (2 * 1.249 Å)
sinθ = 0.616

θ = arcsin(0.616)
θ ≈ 37.87°

Step 4: Calculate the diffraction peak position (2θ)

Finally, we can find the diffraction peak position:

2θ = 2 * 37.87°
2θ ≈ 75.74°
