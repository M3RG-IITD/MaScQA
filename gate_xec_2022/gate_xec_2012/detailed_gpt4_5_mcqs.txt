Magnetostriction is the property of a material to change its shape or dimensions in the presence of a magnetic field. The magnetostrictive materials are widely used in sensors, actuators, and other applications where a change in dimension due to magnetic fields is needed. The best magnetostrictive material is characterized by high magnetostriction, high sensitivity to magnetic fields, and low losses.

Now let's look at the given options:

(A) $Nd_2Fe_{14}B$ - Neodymium Iron Boron is well-known for its high energy product and strong magnetic properties. It is used in permanent magnets and serves a wide variety of applications. However, its magnetostrictive properties are not strong.

(B) $Fe_3O_4$ - Magnetite, or Iron (II, III) Oxide, is a ferrimagnetic material, which means it has both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic properties. Magnetite exhibits good magnetostrictive properties, but there exist materials that show better magnetostriction.

(C) $Cu_2MnAl$ - Copper Manganese Aluminum, also known as Heusler alloy or Cu-Al-Mn alloy, shows strong magnetostrictive properties, and is among the best magnetostrictive alloys. Its high magnetostriction and low losses make it a suitable material for applications involving dimensional changes due to magnetic fields.

(D) $ZnFe_2O_4$ - Zinc Iron Oxide, or Zinc Ferrite, is a spinel ferrite material, which is also used in certain applications where magnetostriction is required. It has some magnetostrictive properties but not as strong as Cu-Al-Mn alloy.

Based on the above information, the correct answer is:

[Option (C) $Cu_2MnAl$]
