In a body-centered cubic (bcc) structure, we can use the relationship between the lattice parameter (a) and the atomic diameter (d) to calculate the lattice parameter of chromium, which is given by:

a = (4/√3) * (d/2)

Given the atomic diameter d = 2.494 Å, we can now calculate the lattice parameter:

a = (4/√3) * (2.494 Å / 2) = (4/1.732) * 1.247 Å ≈ 2.880 Å

So the correct answer is (B) 2.880 Å.

Answer: [2.880]
