To find the volume % of pearlite in the steel, we can use the lever rule. The lever rule formula is:

% pearlite = [(C₀ - Cα) / (CFe₃C - Cα)] * 100

where:
% pearlite = volume % of pearlite
C₀ = initial carbon concentration in the steel (0.45 wt.%)
Cα = carbon concentration in the α phase (0.02 wt.%)
CFe₃C = carbon concentration in the $Fe_3C$ phase (6.67 wt.%)

Now, let's plug these values into the formula and calculate the volume % of pearlite:

% pearlite = [(0.45 - 0.02) / (6.67 - 0.02)] * 100
% pearlite = [0.43 / 6.65] * 100
% pearlite = 0.064661654135338 * 100
% pearlite ≈ 6.47%

The volume % of pearlite in the steel just below 723°C is around 6.47%. None of the given options (A, B, C, D) match this result, so it's possible there is an error in the question or the provided options. However, the calculated result is 6.47%.
