Using the equation of continuity, we have:

$A_1 v_1 = A_2 v_2$

Where:
- $A_1$ and $A_2$ are the cross-sectional areas of the top and base of the sprue, respectively.
- $v_1$ and $v_2$ are the velocities of the melt flow rate at the top and base of the sprue, respectively.

Given:
- The height of the sprue ($h$) is 0.25 m.
- The top cross-sectional area of the sprue ($A_1$) is 2.2 $m^2$.
- The melt flow rate ($Q$) is 4 $m^3.s^(-1)$.

We need to find the maximum cross-sectional area at the base of the sprue, which is $A_2$.

First, we calculate the velocity at the top of the sprue ($v_1$) using the given flow rate:

$v_1 = \dfrac{Q}{A_1} = \dfrac{4 \ m^3.s^(-1)}{2.2 \ m^2} = \dfrac{40}{22} \ m.s^(-1) = \dfrac{20}{11} \ m.s^(-1)$

Using Bernoulli's equation:

$v_1^2 + 2gh = v_2^2$

Where:
- $g$ is the gravitational acceleration, which is 9.81 $m.s^(-2)$.

Solving for $v_2$:

$v_2^2 = v_1^2 + 2gh$

$v_2^2 = \left(\dfrac{20}{11} \right)^2 + 2 \times 9.81 \times 0.25$

$v_2^2 = \dfrac{400}{121} + 4.901$

$v_2^2 = \dfrac{400}{121} + \dfrac{594.0821}{121}$

$v_2^2 = \dfrac{994.0821}{121}$

$v_2 = \sqrt{\dfrac{994.0821}{121}} = \dfrac{\sqrt{994.0821}}{11} \ m.s^(-1)$

Now, we can use the equation of continuity to find the maximum cross-sectional area at the base of the sprue ($A_2$):

$A_2 = \dfrac{A_1 v_1}{v_2} = \dfrac{2.2 \times \dfrac{20}{11}}{\dfrac{\sqrt{994.0821}}{11}} = \dfrac{2.2 \times 20}{\sqrt{994.0821}}$

$A_2 \approx \dfrac{44}{\sqrt{994.0821}}  m^2$

Therefore, the maximum cross-sectional area at the base of the sprue is approximately:

$A_2 \approx \dfrac{44}{\sqrt{994.0821}}  m^2$

Now, let's enclose the answer in a list:

[$A_2 \approx \dfrac{44}{\sqrt{994.0821}}  m^2$]
