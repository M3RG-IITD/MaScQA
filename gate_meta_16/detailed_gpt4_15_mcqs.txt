To answer this question, we must first understand what eutectoid steel is and how different cooling curves affect its microstructure. Eutectoid steel is a type of steel with 0.8% carbon content where the transformation of austenite to pearlite occurs at the eutectoid point. Bainite is a metastable microstructure formed in the steel when it is cooled at a rate between that of pearlite (slow cooling) and martensite (rapid cooling).

Now, let's analyze the different cooling curves and determine which one will result in a 50% bainitic structure.

(A) P:
A slow cooling rate, which allows the steel sufficient time to transform into pearlite. As a result, it will not produce a significant proportion of bainite.

(B) Q:
A moderate cooling rate will create a mix of bainite and pearlite. However, this cooling rate may not be the optimal for producing 50% bainitic structure, as it may lead to a large amount of pearlite and a smaller amount of bainite.

(C) R:
A faster cooling rate than Q, which will lead to a reduced proportion of pearlite and an increased proportion of bainite. This cooling rate might be optimal for producing 50% bainitic structure.

(D) S:
A very fast cooling rate, which leads to the formation of martensite rather than bainite. It will not produce a bainitic structure at all.

Based on the analysis of the cooling curves, the correct option is:

[C] R

This cooling curve has the appropriate cooling rate to produce a 50% bainitic structure in eutectoid steel.
