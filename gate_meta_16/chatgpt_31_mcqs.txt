The mean of the grain sizes can be found by adding all the values and dividing by the number of values:

Mean = (16 + 14 + 18 + 15 + 13)/5 = 15.2 µm

To find the median, we need to arrange the values in order from lowest to highest:

13, 14, 15, 16, 18

The median is the middle value, which is 15 µm.

To find the standard deviation, we first need to find the variance. The variance is the average of the squared differences between each value and the mean. We can calculate the variance as follows:

Variance = ((16-15.2)² + (14-15.2)² + (18-15.2)² + (15-15.2)² + (13-15.2)²)/5
Variance = (0.64 + 1.44 + 6.76 + 0.04 + 4.84)/5
Variance = 2.54/5
Variance = 0.508

The standard deviation is the square root of the variance:

Standard deviation = √0.508
Standard deviation = 0.712

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) 15.2, 15 and 1.9
