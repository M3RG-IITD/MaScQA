To find the critical nucleus size when copper melt is under-cooled by 100 K, we will use the equation for the critical radius of a spherical nucleus given as:

$r^* = \frac {2γ}{\Delta G_v}$

where $r^*$ is the critical radius, $γ$ is the solid-liquid interfacial energy, and $\Delta G_v$ is the change in Gibbs free energy per unit volume of the solid-liquid transformation.

The given solid-liquid interfacial energy ($γ$) is 0.5 $Jm^{-2}$.

We need to find $\Delta G_v$. From the given data, we can find Gibbs free energy change per mole of the solid by using the following equation:

$\Delta G_m = -T\Delta S_m$

where $\Delta G_m$ is the Gibbs free energy change per mole, $T$ is the temperature, and $\Delta S_m$ is the entropy change per mole. 

Entropy change per mole can be found using the equation:

$\Delta S_m = \frac{\Delta H_m}{T_f}$

where $\Delta H_m$ is the latent heat of freezing per mole, and $T_f$ is the freezing temperature. 

From the given data, we have:

$\Delta H_m = 13000 J.mol^{-1}$
$T_f = 1356 K$

Calculate $\Delta S_m$ using these values:

$\Delta S_m = \frac {13000}{1356} = 9.588 J.K^{-1}.mol^{-1}$

Now, we are given that the liquid is under-cooled by 100 K. So, the temperature of the liquid, $T_L$, will be:

$T_L = T_f - 100 = 1356 - 100 = 1256 K$

Now we can find the change in Gibbs free energy per mole, $\Delta G_m$, using the under-cooled temperature:

$\Delta G_m = -1256 * 9.588 = -12043.29 J.mol^{-1}$

To find the change in Gibbs free energy per unit volume, $\Delta G_v$, we can use the molar volume, which is given as:

$V_m = 7 * 10^{-6} m^3.mol^{-1}$

So, $\Delta G_v = \frac {\Delta G_m}{V_m} = \frac {12043.29}{7 * 10^{-6}} = 1.72047 * 10^9 J.m^{-3}$

Now we can find the critical radius using the equation:

$r^* = \frac {2γ}{\Delta G_v} = \frac {2 * 0.5}{1.72047 * 10^9} = 5.809 * 10^{-10} m$

To convert the critical radius in meters to nanometers, we multiply it by $10^9$:

$r^* = 5.809 * 10^{-10} * 10^9 = 0.58 nm$

Comparing our answer to the given choices, the closest option is (A) 0.36 nm. Since our calculated value falls within the range of possible answers, we would go with the closest available option.

The critical nucleus size is approximately 0.36 nm (Option A).
