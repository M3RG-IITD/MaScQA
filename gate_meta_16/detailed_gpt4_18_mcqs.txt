We will go through each option and analyze if it's a valid reason for the wavy slip line patterns in a plastically deformed metal crystal at low temperatures.

(A) Dislocation pile-up:

Dislocation pile-up occurs when dislocations accumulate at obstacles or defects, such as grain boundaries or precipitates, forming a pile-up. The pile-up of dislocations creates a stress concentration at the head, and this pinned leading dislocation might break away from the obstacle, creating a sudden slip in the adjacent grain in the metal. This sudden slip can create wavy slip lines on the surface of the deformed metal. At low temperatures, the metal's lower ductility and limited ability to absorb straining due to dislocation movement can increase the effect of the dislocation pile-up leading to the wavy line formation.

(B) Large number of slip systems:

Slip systems are the combination of slip planes and slip directions on which dislocations can move within the crystal lattice. A large number of slip systems result in more possible slip planes and directions, which give different slip line patterns, but it does not directly cause wavy slip line formation. Moreover, at low temperatures, the number of active slip systems usually decreases, causing a more pronounced wavy slip pattern.

(C) Low stacking fault energy:

Stacking fault energy (SFE) is the energy difference between the equilibrium crystal structure and the crystal structure when a fault occurs. Low stacking fault energy usually causes the crystal lattice to have a high number of partial dislocations, which can lead to planar slip and cross-slip. However, low SFE does not directly contribute to creating wavy slip lines at low temperatures.

(D) Dislocation climb:

Dislocation climb refers to the mechanism by which a dislocation moves perpendicular to its slip plane with the help of diffusion of vacancies. At low temperatures, the rate of dislocation climb is minimal due to reduced diffusion, and it does not directly create wavy slip line patterns.

Based on the analysis of the given options, we can conclude that wavy slip line patterns in plastically deformed metal crystals at low temperatures are primarily due to dislocation pile-up. Thus, the correct answer is:
