1. We will first find the mean, which is the sum of the values divided by the total number of values. 
Mean = (16 + 14 + 18 + 15 + 13) / 5

2. Next, we will find the median by arranging the values in ascending order (13, 14, 15, 16, and 18) and then finding the middle value. Since there are an odd number of values, the median is the middle value.

3. Finally, we will calculate the standard deviation, which is the square root of the variance. Variance is calculated by finding the average of the squared differences between each value and the mean.

Variance = [((13 - mean)^2 + (14 - mean)^2 + (15 - mean)^2 + (16 - mean)^2 + (18 - mean)^2)] / 5
   
Standard Deviation = √Variance

Let's calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation:

1. Mean = (16 + 14 + 18 + 15 + 13) / 5 = 76 / 5 = 15.2

2. Median = 15 (middle value in the ordered list: 13, 14, 15, 16, 18)

3. Variance = [((13 - 15.2)^2 + (14 - 15.2))^2 + (15 - 15.2)^2 + (16 - 15.2)^2 + (18 - 15.2)^2] / 5
   Variance = [(2.2^2 + 1.2^2 + 0.2^2 + 0.8^2 + 2.8^2)] / 5
   Variance = [(4.84 + 1.44 + 0.04 + 0.64 + 7.84)] / 5
   Variance = 14.8 / 5 = 2.96

Standard Deviation = √2.96 = 1.720.

So, the mean is 15.2, the median is 15, and the standard deviation is 1.7 (rounded to one decimal place).

The correct answer is therefore (A) 15.2, 15, and 1.7.
