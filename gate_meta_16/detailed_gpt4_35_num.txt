To find the initial mass flow rate of the liquid metal through the nozzle, we can use the Torricelli's theorem, which relates the speed of fluid flowing out of the nozzle to the height of the fluid column above the nozzle. 

1. First, let's find the speed of the liquid metal flowing out of the nozzle using Torricelli's theorem: 

$v = \sqrt{2gh}$

where
- $v$ is the speed of the liquid metal,
- $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 $m.s^{-2}$),
- $h$ is the height of the liquid metal column (3.2 m).

2. Calculate the speed, v:

$v = \sqrt{2 \times 9.81 \times 3.2} = \sqrt{62.976} = 7.936 \thinspace m/s$

3. Now we'll find the actual flow rate dependent on the discharge coefficient:

$v_{actual} = C_d*v$

where
- $C_d$ is the Nozzle discharge coefficient (0.80),
- $v$ is the speed of the liquid metal (7.936 $m/s$),

4. Calculate the actual speed, $v_{actual}$:

$v_{actual} = 0.80 * 7.936 = 6.3488 \thinspace m/s$

5. Next, we have to calculate the cross-sectional area $A$ of the nozzle:

$A = \frac{\pi d^2}{4}$

where
- $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the nozzle,
- $d$ is the diameter of the nozzle (30 mm = 0.03 m)

6. Calculate the cross-sectional area, $A$:

$A = \frac{\pi \times (0.03)^2}{4} = \frac{\pi \times 0.0009}{4} = 0.00070686 \thinspace m^2$

7. Now, we can find the volume flow rate, $Q$:

$Q = v_{actual} * A$

where
- $Q$ is the volume flow rate,
- $v_{actual}$ is the actual speed of the liquid metal (6.3488 $m/s$),
- $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the nozzle (0.00070686 $m^2$)

8. Calculate the volume flow rate, $Q$:

$Q = 6.3488 * 0.00070686 = 0.004489 \thinspace m^3/s$

9. Finally, we can find the initial mass flow rate, $\dot{m}$:

$\dot{m} = \rho * Q$

where
- $\dot{m}$ is the mass flow rate,
- $\rho$ is the density of liquid metal (7000 kg/$m^3$),
- $Q$ is the volume flow rate (0.004489 $m^3/s$)

10. Calculate the mass flow rate, $\dot{m}$:

$\dot{m} = 7000 * 0.004489 = 31.423 \thinspace kg/s$

The initial mass flow rate of the liquid metal through the nozzle is approximately 31.423 $kg/s$.
