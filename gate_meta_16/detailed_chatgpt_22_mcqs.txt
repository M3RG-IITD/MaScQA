The correct answer is (D) Rolling.

Explanation:
Railway tracks are typically made by rolling, which is the process of reducing the thickness of a metal sheet or plate by passing it between pairs of rolls. Rolling is a common method used in the manufacturing of various metal products, including rails. During the rolling process, the metal is forced to deform, resulting in a reduced thickness, increased length, and improved strength. The rolling process is also an efficient way to produce large quantities of material, making it an economical method for the production of railway tracks. Therefore, the answer is (D) Rolling.
