We will go through each entity and find their dimensions:

[P] Drag coefficient: Dimensionless because drag force is proportional to the dynamic pressure, and a dimensionless parameter to characterize flow behavior. Therefore, its dimensions are $M^(0)L^(0)T^(0)$. So, P corresponds to 3 in Column II.

[Q] Mass transfer coefficient: It is related to the rate of mass transfer and the driving force (concentration difference). The dimensions of the mass transfer rate are $ML^(-2)T^(-1)$ and the dimensions of the concentration difference are $ML^(-3)$. The mass transfer coefficient dimensions can be calculated as the ratio between the rate of mass transfer and the concentration difference: $(ML^(-2)T^(-1))/(ML^(-3)) = M^(0)LT^(-1)$. So, Q corresponds to 4 in Column II.

[R] Viscosity: The dynamic viscosity has dimensions of force time per area or stress(time). The dimensions of stress are $ML^(-1)T^(-2)$, and multiplying by the dimension of time $(T)$, we get $ML^(-1)T^(-1)$. So, R corresponds to 1 in Column II.

[S] Mass flux: It is the rate of mass flow per unit area. Mass flow rate has dimensions of $MLT^(-1)$ and area has dimensions of $L^2$. Thus, the dimensions of mass flux are $(MLT^(-1))/(L^2) = ML^(-2)T^(-1)$. So, S corresponds to 2 in Column II.

By matching entities with their correct dimensions, we get the option (A) P-3, Q-4, R-1, S-2 as the correct answer.

Answer: [(A) P-3, Q-4, R-1, S-2]
