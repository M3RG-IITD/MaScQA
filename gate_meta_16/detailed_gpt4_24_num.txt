To find the fill height required, we need to calculate the volume change during the compaction process.

1. Calculate the volume of the as-pressed compact.

We know the density and mass for the as-pressed compact, so we can use the formula:

Density = Mass / Volume

First, isolate the Volume (V1):

V1 = Mass / Density

Given:
Density = 1755 kg/m³
As-pressed height (h1) = 12 mm

We need to find the mass, so we take the volume of the as-pressed compact:

V1 = π * (h1 * D1²) / 4

Where D1 is the diameter of the as-pressed compact. To calculate the fill height, we don't need the exact value of D1, and it would have the same value before and after compaction, so we can write:

V1 = π * h1 * (D1² / 4) = k * h1

Where k = (π * D1²) / 4

2. Calculate the volume of the aluminium powder before compaction.

Now we want to find the initial volume of aluminium powder before compaction, where:

Mass = constant (Mass of aluminium powder remains the same throughout the process)

Density of aluminium powder = 810 kg/m³

We can write:

V2 = Mass / Density

Since Mass is constant, we can write:

V2 = (Density * V1) / (Density of aluminium powder)

V2 = (1755 * k * h1) / 810

Now, let's calculate the fill height (h2):

V2 = π * (h2 * D²) / 4

Since D is equal to D1, we can write:

V2 = k * h2

Now we can equate the expressions for V2:

k * h2 = (1755 * k * h1) / 810

Solve for h2 (fill height):

h2 = (1755 * h1) / 810

Given h1 = 12 mm:

h2 = (1755 * 12) / 810

h2 = 25.98 mm

The fill height required is approximately 25.98 mm.

Thus, the correct answer is [25.98].
