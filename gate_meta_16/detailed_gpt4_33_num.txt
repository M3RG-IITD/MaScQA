Unfortunately, we cannot view or analyze images in our current form. So, we cannot view the table in the image that you mentioned. However, I can explain how to calculate the activity of A (a_A) in a binary liquid system if you provide the necessary constants or functions describing the relationship between the activity and the atom fraction of the components.

A binary liquid system means that it consists of two components, A and B. The activity of a component in a mixture is a measure of its "effective concentration" and can be thought of as an expression of how that component behaves chemically in the mixture relative to its behavior in a pure state. The activity is dimensionless and is usually related to atom/mole fraction (x) of the components in the mixture.

The activity of a component can be calculated using various models, such as the ideal solution model, Raoult's law model, or some other activity coefficient model. We'd need to know the specific model or equations related to your provided table in order to solve the problem.

For example, in an ideal solution model, the activity of A (a_A) is simply equal to its atom fraction in the mixture (x_A):

a_A = x_A = 0.4

However, for non-ideal solutions or other specific cases, we'll need more data, constant values, or equations to determine the activity of A. Please provide the necessary information from your table so we can assist with calculating the activity of A in the binary liquid system at 1073 K when the atom fraction of A is 0.4.
