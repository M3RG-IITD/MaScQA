To find the standard Gibbs free energy change for the given equilibrium, we can use the formula:

ΔG° = -RT * ln(K)

Where ΔG° is the standard Gibbs free energy change, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T is the temperature in Kelvin, and K is the equilibrium constant.

First, we need to find the equilibrium constant K. Since we are given the activity coefficient of Si at infinite dilution (γ), we can use the following relation:

K = γ * X(Si)

Where X(Si) is the mole fraction of Si. Since Si is 1 wt.% in liquid Fe, we can assume that X(Si) is approximately 0.01. Now, we can find K:

K = 10^(-3) * 0.01 = 10^(-5)

Now, we can find the standard Gibbs free energy change:

ΔG° = -8.314 J/mol·K * 1873 K * ln(10^(-5))

ΔG° ≈ -8.314 * 1873 * (-5 * ln(10))

Here, we remember that ln(10) ≈ 2.303. So, we get:

ΔG° ≈ -8.314 * 1873 * (-5 * 2.303)

ΔG° ≈ 180498.534 J/mol

Now, we need to convert Joules into kJ:

ΔG° ≈ 180.498 kJ/mol

Therefore, the standard Gibbs free energy change for this equilibrium is approximately 180.498 kJ/mol.
