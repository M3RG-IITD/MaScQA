To find the weight percent of FeO in DRI, we can use the following formula:

Weight percent of FeO = (Total Fe - Metallic Fe) / Total wt.% composition * 100

Given:
Total Fe = 92 wt.%
Metallic Fe = 84 wt.%

Weight percent of FeO = (92 - 84) / 100 * 100
Weight percent of FeO = 8 wt.%

Thus, the weight percent of FeO in DRI is 8%.

Answer: [8]
