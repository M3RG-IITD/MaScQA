To solve this question, we will use the following equations:

- For a bcc crystal, the surface energy per unit area of a low Miller index plane is given by: 

$$\gamma_{hkl} = \frac{2E_s}{a^2},$$

where $E_s$ is the surface energy per unit area of the (001) plane, $a$ is the lattice parameter, and $(hkl)$ represents the Miller indices of the plane.

- The surface energy ratio between two planes is given by:

$$\frac{\gamma_{hkl_1}}{\gamma_{hkl_2}} = \frac{f_{hkl_1}}{f_{hkl_2}},$$

where $f_{hkl}$ is the atomic packing factor for the plane $(hkl)$.

For a bcc crystal, we have:

- The (100) plane has Miller indices (100), and the (110) plane has Miller indices (110).

- The atomic packing factor for a bcc crystal is $f_{\text{bcc}} = \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{3}} \approx 0.68$.

Therefore, the surface energy ratio between the (100) and (110) planes of a bcc crystal is:

$$\frac{\gamma_{100}}{\gamma_{110}} = \frac{f_{100}}{f_{110}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}.$$

The answer is:

- $\frac{\gamma_{100}}{\gamma_{110}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}.$
