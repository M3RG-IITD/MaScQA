The passive film in stainless steel forms above the (A) Primary passive potential.

Explanation:

In stainless steel, the passive film is a thin, transparent oxide (or nitride) layer that forms spontaneously on the surface of the steel when exposed to oxygen (or air) at room temperature. This passive film protects the steel against corrosion, and its properties depend on the composition and microstructure of the steel.

The primary passive potential is the range of electrochemical potentials where the passive film forms and protects the steel against corrosion. This range depends on the composition and microstructure of the steel, but typically lies between -0.3 and +0.5 volts (vs. a standard hydrogen electrode, SHE) for austenitic stainless steels.

The breakdown potential is the electrochemical potential at which the passive film breaks down and the steel starts to corrode under the action of an aggressive environment, such as chloride ions or acidic solutions. This potential is lower than the primary passive potential and depends on the aggressiveness of the environment.

The trans-passive potential is the electrochemical potential at which the steel undergoes a transition from the passive to an active state, where it starts to dissolve under the action of an aggressive environment. This potential is higher than the breakdown potential and depends on the composition and microstructure of the steel.

The pitting potential is the electrochemical potential at which localized corrosion (pitting) starts to occur on the steel surface under the action of an aggressive environment. This potential is lower than the breakdown potential and depends on the composition and microstructure of the steel.

Since the passive film forms within the range of the primary passive potential, the correct answer is (A) Primary passive potential.
