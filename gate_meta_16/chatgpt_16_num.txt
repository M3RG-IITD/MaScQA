The given Burger's vector is (a/2)[1 1 0] and the dislocation line is along [112]. 

We can find the angle between the dislocation line and Burger's vector using dot product formula:

cos(theta) = (a/2)[1 1 0] . [1 1 2]/(a/2) * sqrt(2)

On simplifying, we get:

cos(theta) = 1/sqrt(6)

Taking inverse cosine on both sides, we get:

theta = 35.26 degrees (approx)

Therefore, the angle between the dislocation line and its Burger's vector is 35.26 degrees (approx).

Answer: [35.26] degrees.
