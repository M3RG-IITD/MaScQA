Using Griffith's theory, the fracture stress can be calculated using the formula:

σ_f = (√(2 γ E))/a

where 
γ = surface energy per unit area
E = Young's modulus
a = crack length

For the internal crack, a = 5 μm
σ_f = (√(2 x 1 x 10^(-3) x 70 x 10^9))/5 x 10^(-6) = 21.0 MPa (approx)

For the surface crack, a = 3 μm
σ_f = (√(2 x 1 x 10^(-3) x 70 x 10^9))/3 x 10^(-6) = 24.3 MPa (approx)

Therefore, the fracture stress for the surface crack is approximately 24.3 MPa. 

Answer: [24.3]
