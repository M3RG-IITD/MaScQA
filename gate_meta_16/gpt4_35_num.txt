We can use the Torricelli's theorem to find out the velocity at the nozzle exit:

v = √(2gh),

where v is the velocity, g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s²), and h is the height of the liquid column (3.2 m). 

v = √(2 * 9.81 * 3.2)
v = √(62.912)
v = 7.932 m/s

Now, we can calculate the flow rate using the nozzle discharge coefficient (C_d = 0.80), the nozzle diameter (D = 0.03 m), and the density of the liquid metal (ρ = 7000 kg/m³):

Q = C_d * A * v,

where Q is the flow rate (in m³/s) and A is the area of the nozzle.

To find A, we can use the formula for the area of a circle, A = π * (D/2)²:

A = π * (0.03/2)²
A = π * 0.000225
A = 7.069e-4 m²

Now we can calculate the flow rate:

Q = 0.80 * 7.069e-4 * 7.932
Q = 0.00449 m³/s

Finally, to find the mass flow rate, we can use the formula:

mass_flow_rate = ρ * Q,

mass_flow_rate = 7000 * 0.00449
mass_flow_rate = 31.43 kg/s

So, the initial mass flow rate through the nozzle is approximately 31.43 kg/s.
