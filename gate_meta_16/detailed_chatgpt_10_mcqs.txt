(B) Ladle refining furnace

Explanation:

A sub-lance is a device used in steelmaking to measure the temperature and composition of molten steel. It is inserted into the ladle during the ladle refining process, which is a secondary steelmaking process that occurs after the steel has been tapped from the BOF (Basic Oxygen Furnace) and before it is cast in the continuous casting mold. Therefore, option (B) Ladle refining furnace is the correct answer. 

The ladle refining process is a time when various additives can be introduced and impurities removed to improve the quality of the steel. The sub-lance is an important tool used to monitor the process and ensure the steel meets the required specifications. It can be used to measure the temperature, oxygen content, and other parameters of the steel as it undergoes refining in the ladle.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Ladle refining furnace
