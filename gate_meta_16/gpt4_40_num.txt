We can use Henry's Law to solve this problem. Henry's Law states that the concentration of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of that gas above the liquid.

If we let N1 be the initial concentration of nitrogen in the steel (14 ppm) and P1 be the initial pressure (1 mbar), and let N2 be the final concentration and P2 be the final pressure (0.7 mbar), we can write:

N1 / P1 = N2 / P2

We're given N1, P1, and P2, so we can solve for N2:

N2 = (N1 * P2) / P1
N2 = (14 ppm * 0.7 mbar) / 1 mbar
N2 = 9.8 ppm

So, the equilibrium nitrogen content at 0.7 mbar is approximately 9.8 ppm.

The answer is [9.8].
