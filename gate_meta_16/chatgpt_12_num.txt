The radius of the octahedral void in a face-centered cubic lattice is given by:

$r = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{4}a$

where $a$ is the lattice parameter. 

Substituting the given values, we get:

$r = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{4}(0.3571\text{ nm}) \approx \boxed{0.126\text{ nm}}$

So, the radius of the octahedral void in Î³-Fe is approximately 0.126 nm.
