First, we need to calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of the given grain sizes.

Mean:
(16 + 14 + 18 + 15 + 13) / 5 = 76 / 5 = 15.2

Median:
To find the median, we first arrange the grain sizes in numerical order: 13, 14, 15, 16, 18
The median is the middle value, which in this case is 15.

Standard deviation:
1. Calculate the deviations: 
(16 - 15.2) = 0.8
(14 - 15.2) = -1.2
(18 - 15.2) = 2.8
(15 - 15.2) = -0.2
(13 - 15.2) = -2.2

2. Square the deviations:
0.8^2 = 0.64
(-1.2)^2 = 1.44
2.8^2 = 7.84
(-0.2)^2 = 0.04
(-2.2)^2 = 4.84

3. Calculate the mean of the squared deviations:
(0.64 + 1.44 + 7.84 + 0.04 + 4.84) / 5 = 14.8 / 5 = 2.96

4. Take the square root of the mean of the squared deviations:
√2.96 ≈ 1.72

So the mean, median, and standard deviation are 15.2, 15, and 1.7 respectively. The correct answer is (A) 15.2, 15 and 1.7.
