To solve this problem, we need to apply Chvorinov's Rule. Chvorinov's Rule is a simple method for estimating the solidification time (t_s) of a casting based on the mold geometry and a mold constant (n). The formula for Chvorinov's Rule is given as:

t_s = n * (V / A)^2

where:
t_s = solidification time (in seconds)
n = mold constant (in s/mm²)
V = volume of the casting (in mm³)
A = surface area of the casting (in mm²)

First, let us find the volume (V) and surface area (A) of the cylindrical aluminum bloom.

Given that the length (L) of the cylinder is 1000 mm and the diameter (D) is 750 mm, then the radius (R) of the cylinder is:

R = D / 2
R = 750 / 2
R = 375 mm

Now, we can calculate the volume (V) of the cylinder:

V = π * R^2 * L
V = π * (375)^2 * 1000
V ≈ 44,179,603 mm³

Next, let's calculate the surface area (A) of the cylinder. A cylinder has two base areas (each a circle) and one lateral area (a rectangle). The base area (A_base) can be calculated as:

A_base = π * R^2
A_base = π * (375)^2
A_base ≈ 441,786 mm²

Since the cylinder has two base areas (top and bottom), the total base area (A_bases) is:

A_bases = 2 * A_base
A_bases = 2 * 441,786
A_bases ≈ 883,572 mm²

Now, let's calculate the lateral area (A_lateral) of the cylinder:

A_lateral = 2 * π * R * L
A_lateral = 2 * π * 375 * 1000
A_lateral ≈ 2,356,194 mm²

Finally, let's calculate the total surface area (A) of the cylinder:

A = A_bases + A_lateral
A = 883,572 + 2,356,194
A ≈ 3,239,766 mm²

Now that we have the volume (V) and surface area (A) of the cylindrical aluminum bloom, we can apply Chvorinov's Rule to calculate the solidification time (t_s). Given that the mold constant (n) is 2 s/mm²:

t_s = n * (V / A)^2
t_s = 2 * (44,179,603 / 3,239,766)^2
t_s ≈ 28,175 seconds

Since the problem asks for the solidification time in minutes, we need to convert seconds to minutes:

t_s (minutes) = t_s (seconds) / 60
t_s ≈ 28,175 / 60
t_s ≈ 470 minutes

The approximate solidification time for the cylindrical aluminum bloom is 470 minutes, which is not any of the options given. However, the closest option to the correct answer is (C) 440.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is: [470]
