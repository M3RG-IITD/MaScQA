To solve this question, we need to perform a mass balance for iron and calcium oxide.

First, we calculate the amount of iron and calcium oxide in the hot metal and lime.

- Iron in hot metal: 100 metric ton * 93.2% = 93.2 metric ton
- CaO in lime: 5 metric ton * 90% = 4.5 metric ton

Now, we set up a mass balance for iron and calcium oxide in the slag.

Let S be the mass of the slag:

- Mass of CaO in slag: S * 40% = 0.4S
- Mass of FeO in slag: S * 22% = 0.22S

According to our mass balance:

- 4.5 metric ton (CaO in lime) = 0.4S (CaO in slag)
- 93.2 metric ton (Fe in hot metal) - 0.22S (FeO in slag) = Fe (yield)

Now we can solve for S:

4.5 / 0.4 = 0.4S / 0.4
S = 11.25 metric ton

Now we can plug S back into our equation for the yield of Fe:

93.2 - 0.22 * 11.25 = Fe (yield)
Fe (yield) = 93.2 - 2.475 = 90.725 metric ton

Now we can calculate the yield percentage of Fe:

Yield percentage = (90.725 / 93.2) * 100
Yield percentage = 97.34%

So, the yield of Fe is approximately 97.34%.

Final answer: [97.34]
