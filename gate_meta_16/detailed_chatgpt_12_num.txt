In a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure, there are octahedral voids between the close-packed layers. The radius of an octahedral void (rO) can be calculated using the formula:

rO = √(3/4)*a

where a is the lattice parameter of the FCC structure.

Given, the lattice parameter (a) of γ-Fe is 0.3571 nm.

Substituting the given value in the formula, we get:

rO = √(3/4)*0.3571 nm
   = 0.3084 nm

Therefore, the radius of the octahedral void in γ-Fe is 0.3084 nm.

Answer: [0.3084 nm]
