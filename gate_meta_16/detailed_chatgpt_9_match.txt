Column I: 

[P] Xanthate salts 

[Q] Thiobacillus Ferrooxidans 

[R] Hydrocyclone 

[S] Anode effect 

 

Column II: 

[1] Extraction of Al 

[2] Flotation 

[3] Classification 

[4] Bacterial Leaching 

 

Xanthate salts are used as a collector in the flotation process. Therefore, P corresponds to 2. 

Thiobacillus Ferrooxidans (Q) is used in the bacterial leaching process. Therefore, Q corresponds to 4. 

Hydrocyclones are used in the classification process. Therefore, R corresponds to 3. 

Anode effect (S) is a phenomenon that occurs in the extraction of aluminum. Therefore, S corresponds to 1. 

Therefore, the correct match is: 

(B) P-2, Q-4, R-3, S-1 

[P] Xanthate salts --> [2] Flotation 

[Q] Thiobacillus Ferrooxidans --> [4] Bacterial Leaching 

[R] Hydrocyclone --> [3] Classification 

[S] Anode effect --> [1] Extraction of Al 

 

Hence, the correct answer is (B) P-2, Q-4, R-3, S-1.
