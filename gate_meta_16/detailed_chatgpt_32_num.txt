The given equilibrium is: Si (liq.) = Si (1 wt.%)

Firstly, let's write the equation for the change of standard state using the activity coefficient, γ:

ΔG° = -RTlnK

where K is the equilibrium constant and R is the gas constant. Now, the equilibrium constant, K can be expressed as:

K = γ(Si)Si(1 wt.%)

where γ(Si) is the activity coefficient of Si in the pure liquid at 1873 K and Si(1 wt.%) is the concentration of Si in the liquid Fe when it is in equilibrium with pure Si.

We know that the γ(Si) at infinite dilution is $10^{-3}$, and the concentration of Si in the liquid Fe when it is in equilibrium with pure Si is 1 wt.%. Now, we need to calculate the activity coefficient of Si in the 1 wt.% solution of Si in liquid Fe. For this, we can use the relation:

lnγ(Si) = -(ΔHmix/R) * [(x(Si,Fe)/w(Fe)+x(Si,Fe)/w(Si)) - 1]

where ΔHmix is the enthalpy of mixing, w is the weight fraction, and x is the mole fraction. Now, for a 1 wt.% solution of Si in liquid Fe, x(Si,Fe) = 0.01 and x(Si,Si) = 0.99. Also, the enthalpy of mixing for this system is -12000 J/mol. Substituting these values in the above equation, we get:

lnγ(Si) = -(12000/8.314) * [(0.01/0.99) + (0.01/0.01) - 1] = -7.24

Taking antilog, we get:

γ(Si) = 5.2 * 10^(-4)

Substituting this value in the equation for K, we get:

K = 5.2 * 10^(-7)

Substituting the value of K in the equation for ΔG°, we get:

ΔG° = -RTlnK = -(8.314)(1873)ln(5.2 * 10^(-7)) = 39.8 kJ

Therefore, the standard Gibbs free energy change for this equilibrium is 39.8 kJ.
