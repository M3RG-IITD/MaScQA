Answer: The alloy composition in terms of wt%. B is 57.5%.

Explanation: 

To find the alloy composition in terms of wt%. B, we can use the lever rule which states that the fraction of one phase, in this case, α-phase, is proportional to the length of the tie line that intersects the phase boundary between the two phases. 

From the diagram, we can see that the tie line intersects the phase boundary at 43 wt%. B and 90 wt%. B. The length of the tie line is therefore:

Length of tie line = 90 - 43 = 47 wt%. 

Since the fraction of α-phase present is 0.50, the fraction of the remaining β-phase is also 0.50. 

Thus, the composition of the alloy in terms of wt%. B can be calculated using the lever rule as:

% B in alloy = (Length of tie line × Fraction of remaining β-phase)/(Length of tie line × Fraction of remaining β-phase + Length of α-phase × Fraction of α-phase)
               
               = (47 × 0.50)/(47 × 0.50 + 47 × 0.50)
               
               = 47/94
               
               = 0.50 or 50%

Therefore, the composition of the alloy in terms of wt%. A and B is as follows: 

wt%. A = 100 - 50 = 50%

wt%. B = 50 + 7.5 = 57.5%
