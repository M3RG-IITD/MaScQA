To find the resilience, we need to determine the area under the elastic portion of the stress-strain curve. Resilience is defined as the ability of a material to absorb energy when it is deformed elastically and then, upon unloading, to have this energy recovered.

Step-by-step solution:

1. We can see that the elastic portion of the curve is a straight line. Let's find the equation of this line.

 

The equation of the line is:

σ = (E × ε) + σ0

where:
E = slope of the line = (500 MPa - 0 MPa) / (0.02 - 0 MPa) = 25,000 MPa
ε = strain = stress/E = 225 MPa / 25,000 MPa = 0.009
σ0 = y-intercept = 0 MPa

Therefore, the equation of the line is:

σ = (25,000 MPa) × ε + 0 MPa

2. The area under the elastic portion of the curve is given by:

Resilience = (1/2) × σ × ε

= (1/2) × (25,000 MPa) × (0.009)

= 112.5 MPa

Therefore, the resilience of the material is 112.5 MPa.

Answer: [112.5] MPa
