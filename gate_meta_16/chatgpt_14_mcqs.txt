The miller indices of peak A in a cubic lattice can be determined by identifying the spacing between the planes that are causing the diffraction peak, and using Bragg's Law:

nλ = 2d sinθ

where n is an integer representing the order of the diffraction peak, λ is the wavelength of the X-rays, d is the spacing between the planes, and θ is the angle of diffraction.

Looking at the given diffraction pattern, we can see that peak A has the largest angle of diffraction, suggesting that it corresponds to the plane with the smallest spacing. By measuring the angle of diffraction from the pattern and using the wavelength of the X-rays (which is not provided), we could calculate the spacing between the planes and then identify the Miller indices using crystallographic tables.

However, since the information required to calculate the Miller indices is missing, we cannot give a specific answer to this question.

Answer: Not enough information provided to determine the Miller indices of peak A.
