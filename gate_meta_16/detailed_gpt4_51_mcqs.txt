To solve this problem, we will use the rule of mixtures for composite materials. The rule of mixtures states that the elastic modulus of the composite material, E_composite, can be calculated by taking weighted averages of the elastic moduli of the constituents (i.e., the fibers and the matrix).

In this case, the composite material is composed of 40 vol.% glass fiber and 60 vol.% polymer. The corresponding fractions are 0.4 for glass fiber and 0.6 for polymer. Let E_fiber and E_polymer be the elastic moduli of the glass fiber and the polymer, respectively.

Given:
E_fiber = 70 GPa
E_polymer = 3.5 GPa

Using the rule of mixtures:

E_composite = f_fiber * E_fiber + f_polymer * E_polymer

We are asked to find the elastic modulus along the transverse direction. Hence:

E_composite_transverse = 0.4 * E_fiber + 0.6 * E_polymer
E_composite_transverse = 0.4 * 70 GPa + 0.6 * 3.5 GPa
E_composite_transverse = 28 GPa + 2.1 GPa
E_composite_transverse = 30.1 GPa

So, the correct answer is (C) 30.1 GPa. 

Answer: [30.1]
