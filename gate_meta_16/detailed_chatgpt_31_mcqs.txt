To find the mean and median, we must first add up all the grain sizes and divide by the total number of measurements. 

Mean = (16 + 14 + 18 + 15 + 13)/5 = 76/5 = 15.2 µm 

To find the median, we must first put the grain sizes in order from smallest to largest: 

13, 14, 15, 16, 18 

The median is the middle value, which is 15 in this case. 

To find the standard deviation, we must first find the variance (s²). 

s² = ((16-15.2)² + (14-15.2)² + (18-15.2)² + (15-15.2)² + (13-15.2)²)/4 

s² = (0.64 + 1.44 + 6.76 + 0.04 + 4.84)/4 = 13.68/4 = 3.42 

The standard deviation (s) is the square root of the variance: 

s = √3.42 ≈ 1.85 µm 

Therefore, the answer is (B) 15.2, 15 and 1.9.
