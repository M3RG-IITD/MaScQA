To find the tensile stress required for initiating slip, we need to use the Schmid's law equation that relates tensile stress, critical resolved shear stress, and the angle between the direction of the applied stress and the slip direction.

1. Determine the slip direction and slip system:
In a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal, the slip systems are {111}<110>. This means that the slip planes are of the (111) type, and the slip directions are of the <110> type. 

2. Identify the angle between the stress direction and the slip direction:
The applied tensile stress is along the [100] direction. We need to find the angle between the [100] and <110> directions. Let's calculate the angle between [100] and one of the <110> directions, say, [110]:

cosθ = (u . v) / (|u| |v|)
Here, u = [1, 0, 0] (stress direction) and v = [1, 1, 0] (one of the slip directions)

cosθ = (1 * 1 + 0 * 1 + 0 * 0) / (sqrt(1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2) * sqrt(1^2 + 1^2 + 0^2))
cosθ = 1 / (1 * sqrt(2))
cosθ = 1 / sqrt(2)

θ = arccos(1 / sqrt(2))
θ = 45°

3. Identify the angle between the stress plane and the slip plane:
Since the stress plane is the (100) plane and the slip plane is the (111) plane, both contain the [100] direction. Thus, the angle between the stress direction and the slip direction, φ, is the same as the angle between the (100) and (111) planes, i.e., φ = 45°.

4. Use Schmid's law equation:
Schmid's law states that the critical resolved shear stress (τ_cr) is given by:
τ_cr = σ * cosθ * cosφ

Here, σ is the applied tensile stress. We can rearrange the equation to solve for σ:
σ = τ_cr / (cosθ * cosφ)

Given the critical resolved shear stress (τ_cr) is 6 MPa, using the calculated angles θ and φ, we have:
σ = 6 MPa / (cos45° * cos45°)

5. Calculate the tensile stress:
σ = 6 MPa / (0.7071 * 0.7071)
σ = 6 MPa / 0.5
σ = 12 MPa

The tensile stress required for initiating slip on the (111) slip plane in the FCC metal crystal is 12 MPa.

The correct answer is: [12]
