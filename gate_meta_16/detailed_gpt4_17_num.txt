Unfortunately, there is no schematic attached to the question. However, I can provide you with the general steps to calculate the resilience of a material based on a tensile stress-strain curve:

Step 1: Identify the elastic region on the stress-strain curve.
This is the region where the curve is linear or linear-elastic. The material will return to its original shape when the load is removed within this region. This region usually starts at the origin of the graph and extends until the yield point, where the material starts to exhibit plastic deformation.

Step 2: Locate the yield point on the curve.
The yield point marks the transition between the elastic and plastic regions on the stress-strain curve. It is usually characterized by a distinct change in the slope of the curve.

Step 3: Calculate the area under the curve up to the yield point.
The resilience of a material is defined as the energy it can absorb without undergoing plastic deformation. This is represented by the area under the curve up to the yield point, which can be considered as a triangle in most of the cases. To find this area, use the formula for the area of a triangle:

Area = 0.5 x base x height

where the base is the strain at the yield point and the height is the stress at the yield point.

Step 4: The area calculated in Step 3 is the resilience of the material (in MPa).

Keep in mind that the tensile stress-strain curve must be provided to actually perform these calculations.
