We can use the following formula to find the maximum possible reduction during rolling:

maximum_reduction = 2 * roll_diameter * coefficient_of_friction * ln(initial_thickness / final_thickness)

We want to find the final_thickness, so we can rewrite the formula as:

final_thickness = initial_thickness / exp(maximum_reduction / (2 * roll_diameter * coefficient_of_friction))

Given:
roll_diameter = 200 mm
initial_thickness = 250 mm
coefficient_of_friction = 0.1

We assume that the maximum_reduction is equal to the initial_thickness, so the final_thickness equals to 0. Let's rewrite the formula to find the maximum_reduction:

maximum_reduction = 2 * roll_diameter * coefficient_of_friction * ln(initial_thickness / final_thickness)

maximum_reduction = 2 * 200 * 0.1 * ln(250 / 0) - This is not possible to compute because ln(∞) is undefined.

We know that the maximum_reduction should be less than the initial_thickness, so let's assume that the maximum_reduction is equal to the initial_thickness - 1 (maximum possible reduction):

maximum_reduction = 249
final_thickness = 250 / exp(249 / (2 * 200 * 0.1))

final_thickness ≈ 1

Therefore, the maximum possible reduction during rolling of a 250 mm thick plate is roughly 249 mm. However, it's important to note that this is a theoretical value, and the actual maximum reduction might be different depending on factors like material properties and specific rolling conditions.

Answer: [249]
