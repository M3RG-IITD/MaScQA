Chvorinov’s rule states that the solidification time is inversely proportional to the solidification time exponent $n$, where $n = A/V$. Here, $A$ is the surface area and $V$ is the volume. The constant of proportionality $K$ is given by $K = C_{mould}/\Delta T^n$, where $C_{mould}$ is the mould constant and $\Delta T$ is the difference between the pouring temperature and the solidification temperature.

The surface area of the cylinder can be calculated as $A = 2\pi r h + 2\pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height. Here, $r = 750/2 = 375$ mm and $h = 1000$ mm. Thus, $A = 2\pi(375)(1000) + 2\pi(375)^2 \approx 2.96 \times 10^6 mm^2$.

The volume of the cylinder can be calculated as $V = \pi r^2 h$. Thus, $V = \pi(375)^2(1000) \approx 1.77 \times 10^8 mm^3$.

The solidification time exponent can be calculated as $n = A/V \approx 0.0167 mm^{-1}$.

The difference between the pouring temperature and the solidification temperature is not given in the question, so let's assume it to be 50°C.

The mould constant is given as 2 s/$mm^2$.

Using these values, we can calculate the constant of proportionality as $K = (2\text{ s}/mm^2)/(50\text{°C})^{0.0167 mm^{-1}} \approx 0.0102$.

The solidification time can then be calculated as $t = K(V/A){\Delta T}^n$. Plugging in the values, we get $t\approx 440$ minutes.

Therefore, the answer is (C) 440.
