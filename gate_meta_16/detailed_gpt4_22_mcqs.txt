To answer this question, let's first understand each of the manufacturing processes briefly and then determine which one is best suited for manufacturing railway tracks. 

(A) Forging
Forging is a manufacturing process where a metal workpiece is shaped by applying compressive forces through the use of a hammer or die. This process is commonly used for making complex shapes, including engine parts, turbine blades, and other heavy-duty components. This process generally works with small to medium-sized workpieces.

(B) Extrusion
Extrusion is a process used to create objects of a fixed cross-sectional profile. It involves pushing material through a die of the desired cross-section. This method is primarily used for making long products with consistent cross-sections, such as pipes, tubes, and certain automotive components.

(C) Deep Drawing
Deep drawing is a sheet metal forming process in which a sheet metal blank is radially drawn into a forming die by using a mechanical or hydraulic press. This process is commonly used to produce cups, pans, and other cylindrical or conical shapes from a sheet of metal. This process wouldn't be well-suited for producing the long, continuous shape of a railway track.

(D) Rolling
Rolling is a metal forming process in which metal stock is passed through one or more pairs of rolls to reduce thickness, shape, or improve its finish. Rolling is used to produce structural shapes, such as I-beams, railway tracks, and other large-scale metal components.

Now that we have an understanding of each process, we can see that the best-suited choice for manufacturing railway tracks is:

(D) Rolling

Here's the step-by-step explanation of the track's production process:

1. Metal Stock Preparation: First, the raw material, usually steel, is melted and cast into a billet, an intermediate steel form that can be further processed into rails.

2. Reheating: The billet is reheated to a high temperature, usually above 1000Â°C, to prepare it for rolling.

3. Rough Rolling: The hot billet is passed through a series of rolling mills, which reduces its thickness and starts to give it the desired railway track shape.

4. Finish Rolling: The workpiece is further rolled using specially designed rolling mills to achieve the precise dimensional tolerances and geometric profiles required for railway tracks, such as rail head shape, rail width, and rail height.

5. Cooling: Once the rail has been rolled to the desired shape, it is cooled slowly to achieve the desired mechanical properties and to avoid deformation due to rapid cooling.

6. Straightening: After cooling, the rails may be slightly bent, so they are straightened using mechanical rollers, ensuring they meet specific straightness criteria.

7. Inspection and Quality Control: The finished rails undergo stringent inspection and quality control checks to ensure they comply with required specifications and standards.

8. Cutting: The rails are cut to the desired length based on customer requirements and may also undergo additional finishing processes, such as grinding or welding.

Hence, the correct answer is [D].
