For a face-centered cubic unit cell, the lattice parameter (a) and the radius of the octahedral void (r) are related as follows:

a = 2 * (r + R) * √2

where R is the radius of the atom in the unit cell, and r is the radius of the octahedral void.

In a face-centered cubic unit cell, the radius of the atom is half the distance between adjacent atoms along the face diagonal. Let's represent the face diagonal as d. In this case, we can relate the lattice parameter (a) and the face diagonal (d) as:

d = a * √2

Since the face diagonal passes through two atoms and an octahedral void, we can also relate d, R, and r as follows:

d = 2*R + 2*r

Now, we can substitute the relationship of d and a to find the relationship between R, r, and a as:

a * √2 = 2*R + 2*r

Given that the lattice parameter of face-centered cubic iron (γ-Fe) is 0.3571 nm, we can write:

0.3571 * √2 = 2*R + 2*r

However, we still need an additional relationship between R and r to solve for r. In a face-centered cubic unit cell, the length of the lattice parameter (a) is also related to the radius of the atom (R) as:

a = 2 * R * √2

Therefore, we can substitute this relationship into the earlier equation to eliminate R:

0.3571 * √2 = 2 * (0.3571/√2) + 2 * r

Now we can solve for r:

0.3571 * √2 - 0.3571 = 2 * r

r = ((0.3571 * √2) - 0.3571) / 2

r ≈ 0.07275 nm

Thus, the radius of the octahedral void in γ-Fe is approximately 0.07275 nm.

The correct answer is [0.07275].
