The first law of thermodynamics can be expressed mathematically as follows: 

ΔE = Q - W

In other words, the change in internal energy (ΔE) of a system is equal to the heat (Q) added to the system minus the work (W) done by the system on its surroundings.

If we express this equation in differential form (using infinitesimal changes), we can write it as:

dE = δQ - δW

Here, dE represents the infinitesimal change in internal energy, while δQ and δW represent the infinitesimal amounts of heat and work, respectively.

From the given options, we can see that this corresponds to option (A):

(A) dE = δQ - δW

Thus, the correct answer is:
