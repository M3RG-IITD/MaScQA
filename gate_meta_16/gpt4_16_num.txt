To find the angle between the dislocation line and its Burger's vector, first, we need to normalize the direction vectors by dividing them by their magnitudes.

Burger's Vector (b): (a/2)[1 1 0]
Magnitude of Burger's Vector (|b|)
|b| = √((a/2)^2 + (a/2)^2 + 0^2)
|b| = √((a^2 + a^2)/4)
|b| = a/√2

Normalized Burger's Vector (b_normalized) = [1/√2 1/√2 0]

Dislocation Line Vector (l): [1 1 2]
Magnitude of Dislocation Line Vector (|l|)
|l| = √(1^2 + 1^2 + 2^2)
|l| = √6

Normalized Dislocation Line Vector (l_normalized) = [1/√6 1/√6 2/√6]

Now, using the dot product method, find the angle between the normalized Burger's vector and the normalized dislocation line vector.

theta = cos^(-1)((b_normalized • l_normalized) / (|b_normalized| * |l_normalized|))

theta = cos^(-1)((1/√2 * 1/√6 + 1/√2 * 1/√6 + 0 * 2/√6) / (1 * 1))

theta = cos^(-1)(1/√(12) + 1/√(12) + 0)
theta = cos^(-1)(2/√(12))
theta = cos^(-1)(2/2√(3))

theta = cos^(-1)(1/√(3))

Converting the value of the angle to degrees:

theta = (180/π) * cos^(-1)(1/√(3))
theta ≈ 54.74°

The angle between the dislocation line and its Burger's vector is approximately 54.74 degrees.

Answer: [54.74]
