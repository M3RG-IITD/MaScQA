To determine the remaining fatigue life of the piston rod at a stress of 250 MPa, we need to use Miner's rule of cumulative damage. This rule states that the total damage accumulated in a material under a cyclic load can be estimated as the sum of the fractions of life expended in each stress level, weighted by the number of cycles at each stress level.

The equation for Miner's rule can be written as:

`Σ(N_i/N_f)_i = 1`

where `N_i` is the number of cycles at stress level `i`, and `N_f` is the fatigue life of the material at that stress level (i.e., the number of cycles at which the material would fail if subjected to a constant stress at that level). The sum is taken over all stress levels experienced by the material.

To apply this rule, we need to find the fraction of life expended at each stress level. This can be calculated by dividing the number of cycles at that stress level by the fatigue life at that level. We can obtain the fatigue life values from the S-N plot provided in the question.

First, we need to determine the fatigue life expended during the first 1000 cycles at 420 MPa:

`N_1/N_f = 1000/10^4 = 0.1`

From the S-N plot, we can see that the fatigue life of the material at 420 MPa is 10,000 cycles. Therefore, the fraction of life expended at this stress level is 0.1.

Next, we need to determine the fatigue life expended during the next 1000 cycles at 300 MPa:

`N_2/N_f = 1000/10^6 = 0.001`

From the S-N plot, we can see that the fatigue life of the material at 300 MPa is 1,000,000 cycles. Therefore, the fraction of life expended at this stress level is 0.001.

Now, we can use Miner's rule to find the remaining fraction of life:

`Σ(N_i/N_f)_i = 0.1 + 0.001 + (N_3/N_f) = 1`

We can rearrange this equation to solve for `N_3/N_f`:

`N_3/N_f = 0.899`

This means that the remaining fraction of life is 0.899. To find the remaining fatigue life at 250 MPa, we need to determine the maximum number of cycles the material can sustain at this stress level before failure. From the S-N plot, we can see that this value is approximately 2x10^6 cycles.

Therefore, the remaining fatigue life at 250 MPa is:

`N_3 = (0.899)(2x10^6) = 1.798x10^6 cycles`

Answer: 

The remaining fatigue life at 250 MPa is 1.798x10^6 cycles.
