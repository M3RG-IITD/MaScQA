Chvorinov's rule states that the solidification time ($t_s$) is proportional to the volume of the casting ($V$) raised to a power $n$, and inversely proportional to the surface area of the casting ($A$). The proportionality constant is known as the mould constant ($C_m$).

$t_s=C_m \frac{V^n}{A}$

For a cylindrical casting, $V=\pi r^2h$ and $A=2\pi rh+2\pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height (or length) of the casting.

Substituting the given values: $r=375$, $h=1000$, $C_m=2$, $n=2$ (for cylindrical casting)

$t_s=2\frac{\pi(375)^2(1000)^2}{2\pi(375)(1000)+2\pi(375)^2}=\frac{281250000}{750\pi+250\pi} \approx 440$ minutes

Therefore, the approximate solidification time is 440 minutes.

Answer: (C) 440
