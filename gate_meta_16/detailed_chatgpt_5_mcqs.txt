In a typical Ellingham diagram for the oxides, the C + $O_2$ = $CO_2$ line is nearly horizontal because (A) The slope of the line is equal to the enthalpy change at standard state, which is approximately zero in this case. 

Explanation:
An Ellingham diagram is a graph of Gibbs free energy versus temperature. The C + $O_2$ = $CO_2$ line represents the formation of $CO_2$ from its elements. The slope of the line represents the enthalpy change, and the vertical intercept represents the standard free energy of formation, $\Delta G^{\circ}$. The slope of the line is approximately zero in this case because the enthalpy change is relatively small compared to the temperature range shown in the diagram. Therefore, option A is correct. 

Option B is incorrect because the slope of the line does not represent the entropy change. 

Option C is incorrect because the Ellingham diagram assumes ideal behaviour. 

Option D is incorrect because the fact that $CO_2$ is a gaseous oxide is not relevant to the slope of the line. 

Answer: 
(A) The slope of the line is equal to the enthalpy change at standard state, which is approximately zero in this case
