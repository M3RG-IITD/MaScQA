The thermal resistance ($R_{c}$) of a material is given as $\frac{thickness}{thermal \;conductivity}$.

The temperature difference ($\Delta T$) between the two surfaces of the composite is given as $1273 - 473 = 800 K$.

The thermal resistance ($R_{t}$) of the composite can be calculated as:

$$ R_{t} = \frac{thickness \; of \; refractory}{thermal \; conductivity \; of \; refractory} + \frac{thickness \; of \; steel}{thermal \; conductivity \; of \; steel} $$

Substituting the given values, we get:

$$ R_{t} = \frac{0.08}{1.2} + \frac{0.004}{32} = 0.069 \; K.(m^2/W) $$

The heat flux ($q$) through the composite is given as 1600 $W.m^(-2)$.

The thermal contact resistance ($R_{c}$) between refractory and steel can be calculated using the following formula:

$$ R_{c} = \frac{\Delta T}{q} - R_{t} $$

Substituting the given values, we get:

$$ R_{c} = \frac{800}{1600} - 0.069 = 0.431 \; W^(-1).(m^2.K) $$

Therefore, the thermal contact resistance between refractory and steel is 0.431 $W^(-1).m^(2).K$. 

Answer: [0.431 $W^(-1).m^(2).K$]
