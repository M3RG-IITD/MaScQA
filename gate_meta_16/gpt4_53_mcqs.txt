Chvorinov’s rule for solidification time (t) is given by the formula:

t = K * (V/A)^n

where
K is the mould constant
V is the volume of the casting
A is the surface area of the casting, and
n is a constant (usually taken as 2 for simplicity).

In this case, we have a cylindrical aluminum bloom with a length (L) of 1000 mm and a diameter (d) of 750 mm. Therefore, the radius (r) of the bloom is 750/2 = 375 mm.

Now, let's calculate the volume (V) and surface area (A) of the cylindrical bloom.

V = π * r^2 * L
V = π * (375)^2 * 1000 = 44178625π mm³

A = 2 * π * r * (r + L)
A = 2 * π * 375 * (375 + 1000) = 1,303,850π mm²

Now, we can plug these values into the Chvorinov’s rule formula with K = 2 s/mm² and n = 2:

t = 2 * [(44178625π)/(1,303,850π)]^2
t = 2 * (33.86)^2
t = 2 * 1146.3
t = 2292.6 s

Since we want the answer in minutes, let's convert seconds to minutes:

t = 2292.6 s * (1 minute / 60 seconds) ≈ 38.21 minutes

Now let's check which answer choice is closest to our calculated value:

(A) 45
(B) 316
(C) 440
(D) 620

The answer closest to 38.21 minutes is (A) 45.

So, the correct answer is [(A)].
