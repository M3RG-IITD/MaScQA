To calculate the weight percent of FeO in DRI, we first need to find the weight percent of Fe in FeO.

1. Calculate the weight percent of combined Fe (Fe in FeO):
Weight percent of combined Fe = Total Fe - Metallic Fe
Weight percent of combined Fe = 92% - 84%
Weight percent of combined Fe = 8%

2. Calculate the molecular weights of Fe and FeO:
Molecular weight of Fe = 55.85 g/mol (from the periodic table)
Molecular weight of O = 16.00 g/mol (from the periodic table)
Molecular weight of FeO = Molecular weight of Fe + Molecular weight of O
Molecular weight of FeO = 55.85 + 16.00
Molecular weight of FeO = 71.85 g/mol

3. Calculate the weight fraction of Fe in FeO
Weight fraction of Fe in FeO = Molecular weight of Fe / Molecular weight of FeO
Weight fraction of Fe in FeO = 55.85 / 71.85
Weight fraction of Fe in FeO = 0.77677 (rounded to 5 decimal places)

4. Calculate the weight percent of FeO in DRI using the weight percent of combined Fe
Weight percent of FeO in DRI = Weight percent of combined Fe / Weight fraction of Fe in FeO
Weight percent of FeO in DRI = 8% / 0.77677
Weight percent of FeO in DRI = 10.29% (rounded to 2 decimal places)

Therefore, the weight percent of FeO in DRI is approximately 10.29%.
