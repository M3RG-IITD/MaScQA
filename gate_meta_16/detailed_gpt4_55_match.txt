To match the deformation processes with the corresponding stress states, let's first understand each process and the stress state involved in it.

Column I:
[P] Wire Drawing: It is a process where a metal wire is pulled through a die to reduce its diameter. The stress state involved in wire drawing is indirect compression as the material is indirectly compressed from its original shape to a smaller shape.

[Q] Forging: It is a manufacturing process where metal is shaped by applying compressive forces. The stress state involved in forging is direct compression as the material is directly compressed by the hammers or dies.

[R] Stretch Forming: It is a process where a metal sheet or a profile is stretched and bent simultaneously over a die to create a curved shape. The stress state involved in stretch forming is tension as the material is being pulled or stretched.

[S] Cutting: It is a process where excess material is removed from a workpiece with a cutting tool. The stress state involved in cutting is shear as the material is sheared away by the cutting tool.

Column II:
[1] Direct Compression
[2] Indirect Compression
[3] Tension
[4] Shear

Now let's match the deformation processes with the corresponding stress states:

[P] Wire Drawing - Indirect Compression: P-2
[Q] Forging - Direct Compression: Q-1
[R] Stretch Forming - Tension: R-3
[S] Cutting - Shear: S-4

So, the correct answer is:
[(C) P-2; Q-1; R-3; S-4]
