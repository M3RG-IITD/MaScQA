To determine the correct graph for the activation energy of a chemical reaction, we need to recall the Arrhenius equation, which describes the temperature dependence of the rate constant (k) of a chemical reaction. The Arrhenius equation is given by:

k = A * exp(-Ea / (R * T))

where:
- k is the rate constant
- A is the pre-exponential factor or frequency factor (a constant)
- Ea is the activation energy (the energy required for the reaction to occur)
- R is the gas constant
- T is the temperature

Now, we need to see which of the options provided can be used to estimate the activation energy graphically.

(A) k versus T:
This graph does not represent the Arrhenius equation properly. Therefore, activation energy cannot be determined from this graph.

(B) 1/k versus T:
This graph also does not represent the Arrhenius equation well enough to estimate the activation energy graphically.

(C) 1/k versus ln T:
This graph too doesn't model the Arrhenius equation properly and hence, cannot be used to estimate the activation energy.

(D) ln k versus 1/T:
We can rewrite the Arrhenius equation as:

ln k = ln A - (Ea / (R * T))

Now, this equation is in the form of y = mx + c, where y = ln k, x = 1/T, m = -Ea/R, and c = ln A. This graph is a straight line with a slope equal to -Ea/R. If we plot ln k on the y-axis and 1/T on the x-axis, we can determine the slope of the line, and therefore the activation energy (Ea) can be determined graphically.

So, the correct answer is:
