To determine the average interparticle neck size, we can use the relationship between the neck size, the SiC-SiC grain boundary energy, and the SiC-Ni interfacial energy. 

The relationship is given by: 

$$r = 2\frac{γ_{SiC-SiC}}{γ_{SiC-Ni}}d$$

Where r is the neck radius, d is the SiC grain size, $γ_{SiC-SiC}$ is the solid-solid grain boundary energy and $γ_{SiC-Ni}$ is the solid-liquid interfacial energy. 

We are given that $γ_{SiC-SiC}$ = 0.8 J/m^2 and $γ_{SiC-Ni}$ = 0.45 J/m^2. We are also given that d = 20 µm. 

Substituting these values into the equation, we get: 

$$r = 2\frac{0.8}{0.45}(20 \times 10^{-6}) = 7.11 \times 10^{-5} m$$

To convert this to micrometers, we multiply by $10^6$: 

$$r = 71.1 \mu m$$

The average neck size is twice the neck radius: 

$$\text{Average neck size} = 2r = 2(71.1 \mu m) = 142.2 \mu m$$

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 18.32.
