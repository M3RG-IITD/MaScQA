We can use Bernoulli's equation to determine the initial mass flow rate through the nozzle:

$\frac{1}{2}\rho v^2 + \rho gh = \text{constant}$

At the surface of the liquid metal column, the velocity of the fluid is zero, so we can simplify the equation to:

$\rho gh = \frac{1}{2}\rho v^2$

Solving for velocity, we get:

$v = \sqrt{2gh}$

The diameter of the nozzle is given as 30 mm, so the cross-sectional area is:

$A = \frac{\pi}{4}d^2 = \frac{\pi}{4}(0.03\text{ m})^2 = 7.07 \times 10^{-4} \text{ m}^2$

The mass flow rate is given by:

$\dot{m} = \rho AvC$

where C is the discharge coefficient of the nozzle. 

Substituting in the given values, we get:

$\dot{m} = (7000 \text{ kg/m}^3)(7.07 \times 10^{-4} \text{ m}^2)(\sqrt{2gh})(0.80) = 28.67 \text{ kg/s}$

Therefore, the initial mass flow rate through the nozzle is 28.67 kg/s. 

Answer: [28.67 kg/s]
