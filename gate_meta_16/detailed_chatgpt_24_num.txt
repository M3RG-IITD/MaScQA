Given: 

Apparent density of aluminium powder = 810 $kg.m^(-3)$ 

Density of pressed aluminium compact = 1755 $kg.m^(-3)$ 

Height of as-pressed aluminium compact = 12 mm 

Compacting pressure = 600 MPa 

Let us first find out the volume of the as-pressed aluminium compact using the formula: 

Density = Mass/Volume 

Volume = Mass/Density 

The mass of the as-pressed aluminium compact can be found out as: 

Mass = Density x Volume 

The volume of the as-pressed aluminium compact can be found out as: 

Volume = Mass/Density = (810 x $10^(-6)$) x (12 x $10^(-3)$) = 9.72 x $10^(-6)$ $m^3$ 

The mass of the as-pressed aluminium compact can be found out as: 

Mass = Density x Volume = 1755 x 9.72 x $10^(-6)$ kg = 0.01706 kg 

Next, we need to find out the volume of the aluminium powder required to make the as-pressed compact of height 12 mm. 

Volume of the cylindrical die = Area x Height 

Area of the cylindrical die can be found out as: 

Area = Mass/ (Density x Height) 

Area = 0.01706 kg / (810 $kg.m^(-3)$ x 12 $m^(-3)$) = 1.73 x $10^(-6)$ $m^2$ 

The volume of the cylindrical die can be found out as: 

Volume = Area x Height = 1.73 x $10^(-6)$ $m^2$ x 12 $m^(-3)$ = 2.076 x $10^(-5)$ $m^3$ 

The fill height is the height to which the die needs to be filled with the aluminium powder. Assuming the aluminium powder settles down on application of pressure, the fill height can be found out as: 

Fill height = Volume of aluminium powder required/ Area of the cylindrical die 

Volume of aluminium powder required = Volume of as-pressed compact - Volume of the die 

Volume of aluminium powder required = 9.72 x $10^(-6)$ $m^3$ - 2.076 x $10^(-5)$ $m^3$ = -1.103 x $10^(-5)$ $m^3$ 

(Note: The negative sign in the answer indicates that the calculated volume of aluminium powder required is less than the volume of the cylindrical die. This means that the die needs to be filled only partially with the aluminium powder.) 

The fill height can be found out as: 

Fill height = Volume of aluminium powder required/ Area of the cylindrical die 

Fill height = (-1.103 x $10^(-5)$) $m^3$ / 1.73 x $10^(-6)$ $m^2$ = -6.37 mm 

(Note: The negative sign in the answer indicates that the fill height is less than the height of the as-pressed compact. This means that the die needs to be filled only partially with the aluminium powder.) 

Therefore, the fill height required is approximately 6.37 mm. 

Answer: 

- 6.37 mm
