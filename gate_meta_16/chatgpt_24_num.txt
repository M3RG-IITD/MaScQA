We can begin by using the formula for bulk density:

Bulk density = Mass / Volume

We can also express the volume in terms of the height (h) and the cross-sectional area (A) of the cylinder:

Volume = A * h

Thus, we have:

Bulk density = Mass / (A * h)

We can rearrange this equation to solve for the mass:

Mass = Bulk density * A * h

Next, we can use the fact that the apparent density of the aluminium powder is 810 $kg.m^(-3)$. This means that if we were to completely fill the cylinder with loose aluminium powder, the mass would be:

Mass = Apparent density * A * h

We can now find the fill height by setting the mass of the compact equal to the mass of loose powder:

Compacted density * A * 12 mm = Apparent density * A * h

Solving for h, we get:

h = (Compacted density / Apparent density) * 12 mm

Substituting in the given values, we get:

h = (1755 $kg.m^(-3)$ / 810 $kg.m^(-3)$) * 12 mm

h = 25.94 mm, or approximately 26 mm

Therefore, the required fill height is 26 mm (rounded to the nearest whole millimeter).
