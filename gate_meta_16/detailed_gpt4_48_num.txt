To determine the fracture stress for the glass plate with given internal and surface cracks, we'll use Griffith's Crack Theory, which is helpful when dealing with the presence of microscopic cracks.

Griffith's Crack Theory states that the presence of cracks weakens the materials, and when the stress applied is higher than the critical stress, the material will fracture.

The formula for the critical stress (σ) is given by:

σ = √(2 * E * γ) / π * a

where:
E = Young's Modulus of the material
γ = Surface energy per unit area
a = Length of the crack

For the glass plate, we are given the Young's Modulus E = 70 GPa = 70 * 10^9 Pa and surface energy γ = 1 J/m² = 1 N/m. We have two parallel cracks with lengths of 5 μm and 3 μm.

First, we need to determine the critical stress for each crack independently.

Crack 1:
a_1 = 5 μm = 5 * 10^(-6) m

σ_1 = √(2 * E * γ) / (π * a_1)
σ_1 = √(2 * (70 * 10^9 Pa) * (1 N/m)) / (π * (5 * 10^(-6) m))
σ_1 ≈ 4.4 * 10^6 Pa = 4.4 MPa

Crack 2:
a_2 = 3 μm = 3 * 10^(-6) m

σ_2 = √(2 * E * γ) / (π * a_2)
σ_2 = √(2 * (70 * 10^9 Pa) * (1 N/m)) / (π * (3 * 10^(-6) m))
σ_2 ≈ 5.6 * 10^6 Pa = 5.6 MPa

Now, we need to compare the two critical stresses. Since the glass plate fractures at the lowest critical stress, we'll choose the minimum of the two values.

Fracture stress = min(σ_1, σ_2) = min(4.4 MPa, 5.6 MPa) = 4.4 MPa

The fracture stress for the glass plate is 4.4 MPa.

Answer: [4.4MPa]
