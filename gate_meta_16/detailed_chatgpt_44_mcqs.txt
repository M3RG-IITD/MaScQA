The density of a material gives an idea about the degree of packing of the molecules in it. For crystalline materials, molecules are in a fixed arrangement and hence have a higher packing density. In contrast, amorphous materials have random packing arrangements with lower packing density which reflects in its lower density value. The degree of crystallinity is the ratio of crystalline mass to the total mass of the material.

From the given chart, we know that for Sample A, the degree of crystallinity is 0%. This implies that the entire mass is amorphous. Therefore, the density value of Sample A is the same as the density of amorphous polypropylene.

From the chart, at a degree of crystallinity of 0%, the density of Sample A lies between 700 and 800 $kgm^{-3}$. To get a more precise value, we could linearly interpolate using the values given in the chart. 

For example, we can choose two densities and their corresponding degrees of crystallinity and find the density that corresponds to a degree of crystallinity of 0%. 

Let's take the densities corresponding to degrees of crystallinity of 10% and 20%, which are 781 and 827 $kgm^{-3}$ respectively, for Sample B. Using the formula for linear interpolation, we get:

Density of Sample A = Density of Sample B at 10% crystallinity + (Degree of crystallinity of Sample A / Difference in degree of crystallinity) x (Density of Sample B at 20% crystallinity - Density of Sample B at 10% crystallinity)

Plugging in the values, we get:

Density of Sample A = 781 + (0 / (20-10)) x (827-781)
Density of Sample A = 781

Therefore, the density of amorphous polypropylene, as given by Sample A, is 781 $kgm^{-3}.$

The correct answer is (B) 841. 

Note: Linear interpolation is just an approximation technique and the answer could vary slightly depending on the chosen values for interpolation. However, the answer will always be within the range given in the chart.
