Let's analyze each welding process to determine the width of the heat-affected zone (HAZ).

[P] Laser Beam Welding (LBW):
Laser Beam Welding is a fusion welding process that uses a concentrated laser beam to generate a localized and controlled heat source. The high-energy density of the laser beam results in rapid heating and cooling rates, leading to a small HAZ. 

[Q] Submerged Arc Welding (SAW):
Submerged Arc Welding is a fusion welding process that uses a consumable electrode and a continuously fed wire or flux. The arc and molten pool are submerged under a blanket of granular flux, protecting the weld from atmospheric contamination. This welding process generates a widespread heat source that results in a larger HAZ compared to the more focused heat source in Laser Beam Welding.

[R] Metal Inert Gas Welding (MIG):
Metal Inert Gas Welding, also known as Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW), is a fusion welding process that uses a consumable wire electrode and a shielding gas to protect the weld from atmospheric contamination. The heat source is an electric arc between the wire electrode and the workpiece. The HAZ in MIG welding is larger than that in Laser Beam Welding but smaller than in Submerged Arc Welding, as the heat source is more focused than SAW but not as concentrated as LBW.

So, considering the width of HAZ in decreasing order, based on the above analysis, we have:

Q > R > P

Therefore, the correct answer is:

[B] Q > R > P
