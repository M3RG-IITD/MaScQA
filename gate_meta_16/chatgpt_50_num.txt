The surface energy of a crystal plane is given by the formula:

$\gamma = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( \frac{\partial E}{\partial \epsilon_i} \right)_{N,V} A_i$

where $\gamma$ is the surface energy per unit area, $\epsilon_i$ is the strain on the crystal in the $i$-th direction, $E$ is the total energy of the crystal, $N$ is the number of particles, $V$ is the volume, and $A_i$ is the area of the surface perpendicular to the $i$-th direction.

For a bcc metal, the (100) plane has a surface energy of:

$\gamma_{100} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\partial E}{\partial \epsilon_{100}} \right)_{N,V} A_{100}$

where $\epsilon_{100}$ is the strain along the [100] direction and $A_{100}$ is the area of the (100) plane.

Similarly, the (110) plane has a surface energy of:

$\gamma_{110} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\partial E}{\partial \epsilon_{110}} \right)_{N,V} A_{110}$

where $\epsilon_{110}$ is the strain along the $[\bar{1}10]$ direction and $A_{110}$ is the area of the (110) plane.

Using experimental and theoretical results, it has been found that for bcc metals:

$\frac{\gamma_{110}}{\gamma_{100}} \approx 0.86$

Therefore, the ratio of the surface energy per unit area of the (100) plane to that of the (110) plane for a bcc metal is approximately:

$1 : 0.86$

Answer: 

- 1 : 0.86
