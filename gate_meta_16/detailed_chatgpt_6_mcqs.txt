The correct plot for estimating activation energy of a chemical reaction is the Arrhenius plot, which is a plot between ln k (natural logarithm of rate constant) versus 1/T (reciprocal of absolute temperature). 

The equation of the Arrhenius plot is:

ln k = -Ea/RT + ln A

Where:
k = rate constant
Ea = activation energy
R = gas constant
T = absolute temperature
A = pre-exponential factor 

Taking natural logarithm on both sides of the rate equation:

ln k = ln A - Ea/RT

The plot of ln k versus 1/T will be a straight line with slope equal to -Ea/R and intercept equal to ln A. By knowing the slope, we can calculate the activation energy of the reaction.

Therefore, the correct option is (D) ln k versus 1/T.
