To answer this question, we can use Miner's Rule of cumulative damage, which states that the damage caused by different stress levels is linearly additive. So, we can calculate the damage caused by the two stress levels (420 MPa and 300 MPa), and then we can find out the remaining fatigue life at 250 MPa.

First, let us find out the fatigue lives (N) for the two given stress levels:

1. At 420 MPa: N1 (number of cycles for 420 MPa)
2. At 300 MPa: N2 (number of cycles for 300 MPa)

Additionally, let's say the number of cycles at 250 MPa is N3.

Now, we can use Miner's Rule to calculate the cumulative damage:

D = (1000/N1) + (1000/N2) + (Remaining life/N3)

However, we don't have enough information to calculate N1 or N2 directly. We need the S-N curve for the aluminum alloy to determine N1 and N2. The S-N curve generally shows the relationship between stress amplitude (S) and the number of cycles to failure (N). It is typically obtained through experiments or provided by the material manufacturer.

If you can provide the S-N curve or the equation relating S and N for the aluminum alloy, we can proceed with the calculation. Otherwise, we won't be able to solve the problem or give an answer in numerical form.

Assuming you can find the S-N curve or equation relating S and N, you plug in the stress values (420 MPa and 300 MPa) to get N1 and N2. Then use Miner's Rule to solve for the remaining life (number of cycles) at 250 MPa.
