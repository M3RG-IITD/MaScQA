We can use the continuity equation to solve this problem:

$A_1V_1=A_2V_2$

where $A_1$ and $A_2$ are the cross-sectional areas at points 1 and 2, and $V_1$ and $V_2$ are the velocities at those points. We can assume that the density of the molten metal is constant, so we can use the volumetric flow rate, which is given as 4 $m^3/s$.

At the top of the sprue (point 1), the cross-sectional area is given as 2.2 $m^2$ and the velocity is unknown. The volumetric flow rate is 4 $m^3/s$, so we can solve for the velocity:

$2.2V_1=4$

$V_1=\frac{4}{2.2}=1.82 m/s$

At the base of the sprue (point 2), the height is given as 0.25 m and the velocity is unknown. We need to find the cross-sectional area that will give us a velocity that prevents aspiration of molten metal. This is known as the critical velocity, which can be calculated using the following equation:

$V_c=\sqrt{\frac{2gH}{f}}$

where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 $m/s^2$), $H$ is the height of the fluid column (0.25 m), and $f$ is the Darcy friction factor. For a sand mold, we can assume a value of $f=0.02$. Plugging in the values, we get:

$V_c=\sqrt{\frac{2 \times 9.81 \times 0.25}{0.02}}=7.91 m/s$

To prevent aspiration, the velocity at point 2 ($V_2$) must be less than the critical velocity ($V_c$). So we can set up the following inequality:

$V_2<V_c$

Using the continuity equation, we can relate $V_1$ and $V_2$ as:

$A_1V_1=A_2V_2$

Solving for $A_2$, we get:

$A_2=\frac{A_1V_1}{V_2}$

Substituting in the values we have calculated, we get:

$A_2=\frac{2.2 \times 1.82}{7.91}=0.51 m^2$

Therefore, the maximum cross-sectional area at the base of the sprue to prevent aspiration of molten metal is 0.51 $m^2$, which we can write in a list of answers:

- 0.51 $m^2$
