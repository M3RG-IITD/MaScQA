Since the resilience is the ability of a material to absorb energy when deformed elastically and then, upon unloading, to have this energy recovered, we need to find the area under the elastic portion of the stress-strain curve. 

To calculate the resilience, we need to find the area of the shaded triangle in the figure.

First, let's find the strain and stress at the elastic limit:
- Strain at elastic limit = 0.002
- Stress at elastic limit = 250 MPa

Next, we can find the strain and stress at the yield point:
- Strain at yield point = 0.004
- Stress at yield point = 400 MPa

Using these values, we can calculate the area of the shaded triangle as follows:

Resilience = 0.5 x stress x strain
Resilience = 0.5 x (400 MPa - 250 MPa) x 0.002
Resilience = 0.75 MPa

Therefore, the resilience of the material is 0.75 MPa.

Answer: 
- 0.75 MPa
