Given data: Thermal conductivity of refractory = 1.2 $W.m^(-1)K^(-1)$, Thickness of refractory lining = 80 mm, Thermal conductivity of steel = 32 $W.m^(-1)K^(-1)$, Thickness of steel plate = 4 mm. The lining of a box-type furnace is made up of a refractory layer and steel plate as shown in the figure. Steady state temperature at the surface of the refractory is 1273 K and that at the outer steel surface is 473 K. If the steady-state heat flux through the refractory-steel plate composite is 1600 W.$m^(-2)$, and heat flow is along x-direction, the thermal contact resistance ($W^(-1).m^(2)$.K) between refractory and steel is?
