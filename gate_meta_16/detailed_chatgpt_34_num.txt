We can use the formula for steady-state heat transfer:

$$\dot{q}=\frac{\Delta T}{\frac{L}{k_{eff}}}$$

where $\dot{q}$ is the heat flux (in $W/m^2$), $\Delta T$ is the temperature difference (in K), $L$ is the thickness of the composite layer (in m), $k_{eff}$ is the effective thermal conductivity of the composite layer (in $W/m.K$).

We can start by finding the effective thermal conductivity of the composite layer:

$$k_{eff}=\frac{1}{\frac{t_{ref}}{k_{ref}}+\frac{t_{steel}}{k_{steel}}}$$

where $t_{ref}$ and $t_{steel}$ are the thicknesses of the refractory and steel layers (in m), and $k_{ref}$ and $k_{steel}$ are their respective thermal conductivities (in $W/m.K$).

Plugging in the given values, we get:

$$k_{eff}=\frac{1}{\frac{0.08}{1.2}+\frac{0.004}{32}}=0.7609\, W/m.K$$

Next, we can find the temperature difference $\Delta T$:

$$\Delta T=T_{ref}-T_{steel}=1273-473=800\, K$$

Finally, we can use the formula for thermal resistance:

$$R_{contact}=\frac{\Delta T}{\dot{q}A}=\frac{\Delta T}{\dot{q}t_{steel}A}$$

where $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the composite layer (in $m^2$). The area is equal to the product of the width and height of the box, which we can assume is 1m x 1m for simplicity.

Plugging in the given values, we get:

$$R_{contact}=\frac{800}{1600\times 0.004\times 1}=125\, W^{-1}.m^2.K$$

Therefore, the thermal contact resistance between refractory and steel is 125 $W^{-1}.m^{2}.K$.

Answer: 

- 125 $W^{-1}.m^{2}.K$
