To answer this question, let's first understand what a dye penetrant test is and then analyze each statement.

A dye penetrant test (also called a liquid penetrant test or simply penetrant testing) is a widely applied and low-cost inspection method to locate surface-breaking defects in non-porous materials like metals, plastics, and ceramics. The process involves applying a colored liquid (dye) with high surface wetting characteristics, allowing it to seep into any surface-breaking defects, cleaning excess dye from the surface, applying a developer to draw out the dye from the defects, and then inspect the sample for any indications of defects.

Now, let's analyze each statement:

(A) Pre- and post-cleaning of parts are not required
This statement is incorrect. Pre-cleaning the surface is essential to remove any contaminants, allowing the dye to penetrate any surface-breaking defects effectively. Post-cleaning is needed to remove excess dye from the surface, ensuring proper application of the developer and a clear indication of defects after the test.

(B) Internal defects can be detected
This statement is incorrect. Dye penetrant testing can only identify defects that break the surface of the sample, such as cracks, porosity, and other surface discontinuities. It cannot detect internal defects like voids, inclusions, or internal cracks in the material.

(C) Surface oxides help in crack identification
This statement is incorrect. Surface oxides can obscure surface-breaking defects, making it difficult for the dye to penetrate and provide accurate indications. For better results, it is essential to remove surface oxides during the pre-cleaning process.

(D) Dye with low contact angle is required
This statement is correct. The dye used in penetrant testing should have a low contact angle (high wetting ability) to effectively penetrate surface-breaking defects. A low contact angle ensures that the dye can spread easily and evenly over the surface, resulting in better penetration and more accurate results.

So, the correct answer is:
[D]
