An Ellingham diagram is a graphical representation showing the stability of various compounds in relation to temperature and partial pressure of oxygen. It is used to determine the spontaneity of a reduction reaction and making predictions about the feasibility of a reaction. In this diagram, the x-axis represents the temperature, while the y-axis measures the free energy, the Gibbs free energy, of the reaction or the standard free energy of formation (ΔG) of oxides.

The equation for calculating ΔG is:
ΔG = ΔH - TΔS

Where ΔH is the enthalpy change, ΔS is the entropy change, and T represents the temperature.

Now let's examine the options one by one.

(A) The slope of the line is equal to the enthalpy change at standard state, which is approximately zero in this case.
The enthalpy change (ΔH) is not responsible for the slope of the line in the Ellingham diagram. The slope of the line is determined by the entropy change (ΔS) since the equation is ΔG = ΔH - TΔS. So, option A is incorrect.

(B) The slope of the line is equal to the entropy change at standard state, which is approximately zero in this case.
As ΔG = ΔH - TΔS, the slope of the line is -ΔS (negative of the entropy change). In the case of the C + $O_2$ = $CO_2$ reaction, the entropy change is approximately zero because there is no significant change in the number of moles of the gaseous components (1 mole of CO2 produced and 1 mole of O2 consumed). Thus, the slope is nearly horizontal, and option B is correct.

(C) $CO_2$ shows non-ideal behavior.
Non-ideal behavior of CO2 does not affect the slope of the line in the Ellingham diagram. Therefore, option C is incorrect.

(D) $CO_2$ is a gaseous oxide.
The fact that CO2 is a gaseous oxide does not directly explain why the line is nearly horizontal in the Ellingham diagram. Option D is incorrect.

So, the correct answer is [B].
