To find out the weight percent of FeO in DRI, we first need to calculate the weight percent of C in DRI.

Weight percent of C = 100% - (total weight percent of Fe + weight percent of gangue)
Weight percent of C = 100% - (92% + remainder)
Weight percent of C = 8% - remainder

We know that metallic Fe is 84 wt.%, which means that the rest of the Fe is in the form of FeO.

Weight percent of FeO = total weight percent of Fe - weight percent of metallic Fe
Weight percent of FeO = 92% - 84%
Weight percent of FeO = 8%

Therefore, the weight percent of FeO in DRI is 8%. 

Answer: 
- 8%
