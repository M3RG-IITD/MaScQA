Unfortunately, I am not able to view images. However, I can try to help you with the concept of energy band diagrams of intrinsic semiconductors at thermal equilibrium.

An intrinsic semiconductor at thermal equilibrium (300 K) has the following properties:

1. The Fermi level (E_f) lies near the middle of the energy gap between the conduction band (E_c) and the valence band (E_v).
2. Electrons and holes have the same effective mass, so their concentrations (n and p) in the semiconductor will be equal.
3. The electron concentration in the conduction band (n) is equal to the hole concentration in the valence band (p) and can be found using the intrinsic carrier concentration (n_i).

I hope this information is helpful. However, I am unable to give the correct answer in this case since I cannot access the given image or the accompanying columns.
