First, let's determine the interfacial energies in the composite. We have the solid-solid grain boundary energy (γ_(SiC-SiC)) and solid-liquid interfacial energy (γ_(SiC-Ni)). These energies are important because they determine the balance of forces at the solid-solid grain boundaries in the sintered composite.

Next, we will use the Young-Laplace equation to calculate the capillary pressure at the solid-solid grain boundary. The Young-Laplace equation is given by:

ΔP = 2 × γ_(SiC-SiC) / r_Neck

Where ΔP is the capillary pressure, γ_(SiC-SiC) is the solid-solid grain boundary energy, and r_Neck is the radius of the neck between solid particles (SiC-SiC).

We're given the solid-solid grain boundary energy (γ_(SiC-SiC) = 0.80 J/m²), and we want to find the r_Neck that corresponds to the average interparticle neck size.

To find the neck size, we need to consider the balance between the forces acting on the neck. The capillary pressure is trying to increase the size of the neck, and the solid-liquid interfacial energy opposes that.

We can write an equilibrium equation based on the forces acting on the neck:

γ_(SiC-Ni) × π × r_Neck = γ_(SiC-SiC) × 2π × r_Neck

Dividing by π × r_Neck on both sides, we get:

γ_(SiC-Ni) = 2 × γ_(SiC-SiC)

Now, we'll plug in the given values for the interfacial energies:

0.45 = 2 × 0.80

Let's solve for γ_(SiC-SiC):

γ_(SiC-SiC) = 0.45 / 2 = 0.225 J/m²

Now that we have the value for γ_(SiC-SiC), we can use the Young-Laplace equation to find r_Neck:

ΔP = 2 × γ_(SiC-SiC) / r_Neck

ΔP = 2 × 0.225 J/m² / r_Neck

Since the given SiC grain size is 20 µm, we can assume that the capillary pressure ΔP is equal to the atmospheric pressure (P_atm). Therefore, we can write:

P_atm = 2 × γ_(SiC-SiC) / r_Neck

To solve for r_Neck, we can isolate it in the equation:

r_Neck = 2 × γ_(SiC-SiC) / P_atm

Let's plug in the values for γ_(SiC-SiC) and P_atm (taking P_atm ≈ 10^5 Pa):

r_Neck = 2 × 0.225 J/m² / 10^5 Pa = 4.5 × 10^(-6) m

Now, we'll convert r_Neck to µm:

r_Neck = 4.5 × 10^(-6) m × 10^(6) µm/m = 4.5 µm

Since the neck size is rounded up, we get:

r_Neck ≈ 4.5 µm

Looking at the given options (A) 3.03, (B) 4.28, (C) 9.16, and (D) 18.32, the closest value to our calculated r_Neck is option (B) 4.28. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 4.28 µm.

Answer: [(B) 4.28]
