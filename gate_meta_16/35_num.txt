Given data: Density of liquid metal = 7000 kg.$m^(-3)$, Nozzle diameter = 30 mm, Nozzle discharge coefficient = 0.80 .The height of a liquid metal column in a cylindrical vessel is 3.2 m. At time t=0, liquid metal is drained out from the vessel through a small nozzle located at the base of the vessel. Neglecting frictional losses, the initial mass flow rate (in $kg.s^(-1)$) through the nozzle is
