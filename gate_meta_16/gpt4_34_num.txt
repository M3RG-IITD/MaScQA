Let's denote the temperatures at the refractory-steel interface and the outer steel surface as T1 and T2, respectively. We know the heat flux (Q) through the composite is 1600 W/m². Heat flux across the refractory can be calculated as:

Q_r = k_r * (T_surface - T1) / d_r

Where k_r = 1.2 W/m.K is the thermal conductivity of the refractory, d_r = 80 * 10^(-3) m (thickness of refractory), and T_surface = 1273 K is the temperature on the surface of the refractory. We'll solve for T1 later.

Heat flux across the steel can be calculated as:

Q_s = k_s * (T1 - T2) / d_s

Where k_s = 32 W/m.K is the thermal conductivity of the steel, d_s = 4 * 10^(-3) m (thickness of steel), and T2 = 473 K is the temperature at the outer steel surface. We'll solve for T1 later.

At steady state, heat flux across the refractory and steel are equal, so we can set Q_r = Q_s:

k_r * (T_surface - T1) / d_r = k_s * (T1 - T2) / d_s

Now we can solve for T1:

(1.2 * (1273 - T1)) / 0.080 = (32 * (T1 - 473)) / 0.004

Simplifying and solving for T1:

T1 = 935 K

Now that we have T1, we can determine the contact resistance:

Heat flux through the refractory-steel plate composite is given, Q = 1600 W/m². Let R_c be the thermal contact resistance between the refractory and steel. Then, contact resistance can be calculated as:

Q = (T1 - T2) / R_c

We can now solve for R_c:

R_c = (T1 - T2) / Q

R_c = (935 - 473) / 1600

R_c = 0.289 W^(-1).m^(2).K

Thus, the thermal contact resistance between the refractory and steel is 0.289 W^(-1).m^(2).K. The correct answer is [0.289].
