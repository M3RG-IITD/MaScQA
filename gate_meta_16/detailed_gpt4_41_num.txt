To answer this question, we need the values of the Avrami exponent (n) and the rate constant (k). However, these values are not provided in the question. So, we cannot give a numeric answer to this question. Instead, I will provide a detailed explanation of the isothermal phase transformation, the Avrami equation, and how to use the equation to calculate the fraction transformed after a given time.

Isothermal phase transformation is a process that occurs in materials where the phase change (e.g., solidification, crystallization, or phase separation) happens at a constant temperature. It is a common phenomenon in metallurgy, ceramics, and polymers. In isothermal phase transformation, the fraction of a material that has transformed depends on the transformation time and the kinetics of the process, which can be described using the Avrami equation.

The Avrami equation is given by:

f = 1 – exp(–kt^n)

where,
f: fraction transformed (dimensionless)
k: rate constant (depends on the material and temperature, units: [time]^(-n))
t: transformation time (units: time, e.g., seconds)
n: Avrami exponent (dimensionless, an empirical value that can range between 1 and 4, depending on the dimensionality of the transformation and nucleation mechanism)
exp: exponential function

If we are provided the values of n and k, we can use the Avrami equation to calculate the fraction transformed at any given transformation time.

Now, let's say we have n and k values and want to calculate the fraction transformed in 300 seconds. We would follow these steps:

Step 1: Plug in the values of k, n, and t (300 seconds) into the Avrami equation:

f = 1 – exp(–k(300)^n)

Step 2: Evaluate the exponent, -k(300)^n.

Step 3: Calculate exp(–k(300)^n) using the value found in Step 2.

Step 4: Subtract the value found in Step 3 from 1:

f = 1 - [the value from Step 3]

Step 5: The result obtained in Step 4 is the fraction transformed at 300 seconds. 

Given that we do not have values for n and k, we cannot provide a concrete answer for the fraction transformed in 300 seconds. If you can provide the values of n and k, we would be happy to help you calculate the fraction transformed.
