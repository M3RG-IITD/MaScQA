To determine the chemical formula of wüstite, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Know what wüstite is.
Wüstite is a mineral containing iron and oxygen. It is an iron oxide with non-stoichiometric composition.

Step 2: Compare the given options with the known information about wüstite.
Now let's go through each option and see if they match the properties of wüstite.

(A) $FeS_2$: This is iron sulfide, not an iron oxide, so it cannot be wüstite.

(B) $Fe_2O_3$: This is iron (III) oxide, also known as hematite. It is a red iron oxide, but it's not wüstite as it has a stoichiometric composition, whereas wüstite has a non-stoichiometric composition.

(C) $Fe_3O_4$: This is iron (II, III) oxide, also known as magnetite. It is a black or brownish-black iron oxide, but it's not wüstite because it also has a stoichiometric composition.

(D) $Fe_{(1-x)}O$: This formula represents non-stoichiometric iron (II) oxide, where x represents the deviation from the ideal stoichiometric composition. Since wüstite is a non-stoichiometric iron oxide, this formula matches the known properties of wüstite.

Answer: The correct chemical formula for wüstite is (D) $Fe_{(1-x)}O$.
So, the correct answer is [D].
