To solve this problem, we will first calculate the volume of the as-pressed compact, and then use the volume and apparent density of the aluminum powder to find the fill height required.

Step 1: Calculate the volume of the as-pressed compact.
The mass of the as-pressed compact can be found using the density of the as-pressed aluminum compact and the formula:

Mass = Density x Volume

We can rearrange this to find the volume of the as-pressed compact:

Volume = Mass / Density

We know the density of the as-pressed compact is 1755 kg/m³, and we know that the height of the compact is 12 mm = 0.012 m. Let's assume the base area of the cylinder is A.

Therefore, the volume of the as-pressed compact is:

V = A * 0.012

Step 2: Calculate the mass of the as-pressed compact.

We know that the density of the as-pressed compact is 1755 kg/m³. We can use the volume equation from step 1 to find the mass of the compact.

Mass = Density * Volume
     = 1755 kg/m³ * A * 0.012

Step 3: Calculate the volume of the uncompacted aluminum.

We know that the mass of the compact remains the same before and after compaction. Therefore, we can use the apparent density of the aluminum powder (810 kg/m³) to find the volume before compaction.

Volume = Mass / Density
Let's call the required fill height H. So the volume of the uncompacted aluminum will be A * H.

A*H = Mass / 810 kg/m³
A*H = (1755 kg/m³ * A * 0.012) / 810 kg/m³

Step 4: Solve for fill height (H).

Now we can solve for the fill height H:

A*H = (1755 kg/m³ * A * 0.012) / 810 kg/m³
H = (1755 * 0.012) / 810

H ≈ 0.0259 m

Convert the fill height to mm:

Fill height = 0.0259 m * 1000 = 25.9 mm

The fill height required is approximately 25.9 mm.

The answer is [25.9].
