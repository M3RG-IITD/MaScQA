To solve this question, we need to use the principle of mass balance. 

Let's first calculate the mass of lime used in BOF steelmaking: 

Mass of lime = 5 metric ton 

Now let's calculate how much CaO was added to the hot metal: 

Mass of CaO added = 5 metric ton x 0.9 = 4.5 metric ton 

Next, we need to calculate how much CaO and FeO are present in the slag: 

Mass of slag produced = 100 metric ton - Mass of hot metal = 100 metric ton - 5 metric ton = 95 metric ton 

Mass of CaO in slag = 95 metric ton x 0.4 = 38 metric ton 

Mass of FeO in slag = 95 metric ton x 0.22 = 20.9 metric ton 

Using the principle of mass balance, we know that: 

Mass of CaO added = Mass of CaO in slag 

Therefore, 

4.5 metric ton = 38 metric ton x (1/90) 

Solving for 38, we get: 

Mass of CaO in slag = 1.58 metric ton 

Now, we can use the mass of FeO in slag to calculate the yield of Fe: 

Yield of Fe = (Mass of hot metal - Mass of FeO in slag) / Mass of hot metal x 100 

Yield of Fe = (100 metric ton - 20.9 metric ton) / 100 metric ton x 100 = 79.1% 

Therefore, the yield of Fe is 79.1%. 

Answer: 
- 79.1%
