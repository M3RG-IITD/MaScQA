We can solve this problem step by step.

1. Calculate the maximum possible angle of bite:
The angle of bite is the angle between the tangent to the roll surface and the rolling direction. It is related to the coefficient of friction (μ) by the formula: tan(α) = μ.

Let's find the angle of bite in degrees:

α = arctan(μ)
α = arctan(0.1)

α ≈ 5.71°

2. Calculate the contact length of the roll (L):

Now we have to find the length of the contact area between the rolls and the plate. The contact area is in the form of an ellipse, but we can assume it's a segment of a circular arc. In this case, the relation between the roll diameter (D), contact width (L), and the angle of bite (α) is:

L = (D/2) × (1 - cos(α))

Now we can find L:

L = (200/2) × (1 - cos(5.71°))
L ≈ 100 × (1 - 0.996)
L ≈ 100 × 0.004

L ≈ 0.4 mm

3. Calculate the maximum possible reduction (Δh):

The maximum possible reduction is related to the roll diameter (D) and the contact length of the roll (L) by the formula:

Δh = D - √(D² - L²)

Let's find Δh:

Δh = 200 - √(200² - 0.4²)
Δh = 200 - √(40000 - 0.16)
Δh = 200 - √(39999.84)

Δh ≈ 200 - 199.998

Δh ≈ 0.002 mm

So, the maximum possible reduction during rolling of a 250 mm thick plate is 0.002 mm.

Answer: [0.002]
