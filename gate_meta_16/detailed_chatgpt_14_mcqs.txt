To determine the Miller indices of a peak in an X-ray diffraction pattern, we need to use Bragg's law, which relates the angle of diffraction ($\theta$), the wavelength of the incident X-rays ($\lambda$), and the distance between planes of atoms in the crystal ($d$):

$n \lambda = 2d \sin \theta$

where $n$ is an integer representing the order of diffraction. For a cubic crystal, the distance between planes of atoms can be expressed as:

$d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2}}$

where $a$ is the lattice parameter and $h$, $k$, and $l$ are the Miller indices of the planes being diffracted. 

Looking at the X-ray diffraction pattern given, we can see that the peak labeled "A" has the highest intensity and is the most well-defined peak. Therefore, we will focus on determining the Miller indices of this peak.

First, we need to measure the angle of diffraction ($\theta_A$) for peak A. We can use the scale given in the schematic to estimate that $\theta_A \approx 29^\circ$. We also need to know the wavelength of the X-rays being used. The schematic does not provide this information, so we will assume a common value for X-ray diffraction experiments, which is $\lambda = 1.54$ Å (angstroms).

Next, we can use Bragg's law to calculate the distance between planes of atoms ($d_A$) for the planes that diffracted peak A:

$n \lambda = 2d_A \sin \theta_A$

We will assume the first order of diffraction ($n=1$) since that is most common and corresponds to the highest intensity. Solving for $d_A$:

$d_A = \frac{n \lambda}{2 \sin \theta_A} = \frac{(1)(1.54\ \textrm{Å})}{2 \sin 29^\circ} \approx 2.87\ \textrm{Å}$

Now we can use the formula for the distance between planes of atoms in a cubic crystal to determine the possible Miller indices for peak A:

$d_A = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h_A^2 + k_A^2 + l_A^2}}$

We recognize that since peak A is a strong (highly intense) peak, it corresponds to a plane with a high atomic density (i.e. many atoms lying perpendicular to the plane of the crystal). For a cubic crystal this means we should consider only the planes that are perpendicular to one of the main crystallographic axes, which are the [100], [010], and [001] directions.

Let's begin by considering the [100] direction. This means that $h_A = 1$ and $k_A = l_A = 0$. Substituting these values into the formula for $d_A$ and solving for $a$:

$a = d_A \sqrt{h_A^2 + k_A^2 + l_A^2} = 2.87\ \textrm{Å} \sqrt{1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2} \approx 2.87\ \textrm{Å}$

This is a reasonable value for the lattice parameter of a cubic crystal, but it does not allow for any unique Miller indices to be determined. We could try the same procedure for the [010] and [001] directions, but we would obtain the same result: a lattice parameter of approximately 2.87 Å.

Therefore, we conclude that peak A in the X-ray diffraction pattern corresponds to a cubic crystal with a lattice parameter of approximately 2.87 Å, but we cannot determine the unique Miller indices of the planes responsible for diffraction based on the information provided in the schematic. 

So the answer is: none of the given options (A), (B), (C), or (D) are correct.
