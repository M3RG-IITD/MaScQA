To determine the fracture stress, we can use the Griffith's criterion for brittle materials, which states:
  
  σ_f = √(2 * E * γ / π * a)
  
Where:

- σ_f is the fracture stress
- E is Young's Modulus
- γ is the surface energy per unit area
- a is the half of the crack length (a = L / 2)

For the internal crack:

- Length L = 5 μm = 5 * 10^(-6) m
- a = L / 2 = 2.5 * 10^(-6) m

For the surface crack:

- Length L = 3 μm = 3 * 10^(-6) m
- a = L / 2 = 1.5 * 10^(-6) m

We'll calculate the fracture stress for both cases and choose the lower value, as it represents the weakest point.

For the internal crack:

σ_f(internal) = √(2 * 70 * 10^9 * 1 * 10^(-2) / (π * 2.5 * 10^(-6)))
σ_f(internal) ≈ √(140000000 / 7.85398 * 10^(-6))
σ_f(internal) ≈ 1,697 MPa

For the surface crack:

σ_f(surface) = √(2 * 70 * 10^9 * 1 * 10^(-2) / (π * 1.5 * 10^(-6)))
σ_f(surface) ≈ √(140000000 / 4.71239 * 10^(-6))
σ_f(surface) ≈ 2,598 MPa

The fracture stress for the internal crack is lower, so the correct answer is the fracture stress for the internal crack:
