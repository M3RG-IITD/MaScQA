The resolved shear stress in FCC crystal structure is given by:

τ = (σ/2) * [1+(cos(3θ))]^(1/2)

Here, σ is the applied tensile stress along the [100] direction and θ is the angle between the tensile stress direction and slip plane normal.

For slip to initiate on (111) plane, the angle between tensile stress and slip plane should be 45 degrees.

θ = 45 degrees

τ = 6 MPa

Substituting these values in the above equation gives

6 = (σ/2) * [1 + cos(135)]^(1/2)

6 = (σ/2) * (1 + (-1/√2))

6 = (σ/2) * (1 - 0.707)

6 = (σ/2) * 0.293

σ = 40.904 MPa

Therefore, the tensile stress required for initiating slip on the (111) slip plane is 40.904 MPa. 

Answer: [40.904 MPa]
