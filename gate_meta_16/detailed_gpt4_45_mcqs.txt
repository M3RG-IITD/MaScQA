Unfortunately, there is no image or table provided to base the answer. However, we can discuss some basic concepts of intrinsic semiconductors at thermal equilibrium, and you can use this information to guide your decision.

An intrinsic semiconductor is a pure semiconductor material without any doping, and at thermal equilibrium, it means that the semiconductor is in a stable state and not externally driven, and the energy levels are distributed according to the Fermi-Dirac statistics.

In an intrinsic semiconductor at thermal equilibrium, several essential properties hold:

1. The number of electrons (n) is equal to the number of holes (p): n = p
2. The Fermi level (Ef) lies approximately in the middle of the bandgap.
3. The product of the electron concentration (n) and the hole concentration (p) is equal to the square of intrinsic carrier concentration (ni^2): np = ni^2

To determine which of the four columns correctly represents the listed parameters for the intrinsic semiconductor, you should consider the above properties and check if the information in the column matches these properties.

Again, since I cannot see the image or the table, I recommend considering these properties while choosing the correct column.
