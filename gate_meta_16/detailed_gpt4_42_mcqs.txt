We have two reactions at thermodynamic equilibrium:

1) ZnO(s) + C(s) = Zn(g) + CO(g)
2) 2CO(g) = CO2(g) + C(s)

Let's write the expressions for equilibrium constants for these reactions.

1) K1 = (p(Zn) * p(CO)) / (p(ZnO) * p(C))
2) K2 = (p(CO2)) / (p(CO))^2

Now, we need to find a relationship between partial pressures of Zn, CO, and CO2. Let's derive that using the expressions for equilibrium constants.

From expression (1), we get:
p(Zn) * p(CO) = K1 * p(ZnO) * p(C)     
=> p(Zn) = (K1 * p(ZnO) * p(C)) / p(CO)    .... (Eq. 1)

From expression (2), we get:
p(CO2) = K2 * (p(CO))^2                      
=> p(CO) = sqrt(p(CO2)/K2)               .... (Eq. 2)

Now, let's substitute Eq. 2 into Eq. 1:
p(Zn) = (K1 * p(ZnO) * p(C)) / sqrt(p(CO2)/K2)

Since p(ZnO) and p(C) are constants in this system, let's introduce a new constant K3 = K1 * p(ZnO) * p(C). So, the equation becomes:
p(Zn) = K3 / sqrt(p(CO2)/K2)

Now let's find the relationship between p(Zn), p(CO), and p(CO2). From Eq. 2, we can write:
p(CO) = sqrt(K2 * p(CO2))        .... (Eq. 3)

Now let's express p(CO2) in terms of p(CO) using Eq. 3:
p(CO2) = (p(CO))^2 / K2          .... (Eq. 4)

Now substitute Eq. 4 into Eq. 1:
p(Zn) = K3 / sqrt((p(CO))^2 / K2)

This equation can be simplified to:
p(Zn) = (K3 * sqrt(K2)) / p(CO)

Since K3 * sqrt(K2) is also a constant, let's write:
p(Zn) = K4 / p(CO)

Now multiply both sides by p(CO) to get the relationship between p(Zn), p(CO), and p(CO2):
p(Zn) * p(CO) = K4

Now substitute Eq. 4 for p(CO2) to express the relationship in terms of p(Zn), p(CO), and p(CO2):
p(Zn) * p(CO) = K4
p(Zn) * (p(CO2) / K2) = K4

This equation can be rearranged to give the relationship between p(Zn), p(CO), and p(CO2):
p(Zn) = (K4 * K2) / p(CO2)

Comparing this with the given options, we find that it matches the form of option C:

p(Zn) = p(CO) + p(CO2)

So, the correct answer is:
