Let's first understand the stress states associated with each deformation process:

- Wire Drawing: involves pulling a metal wire through a small orifice, which leads to an increase in its length and a decrease in its diameter. This process involves tension stress as the material is being stretched.
- Forging: involves shaping a metal by hammering it while heated. This process involves compression stress as the material is being squished.
- Stretch Forming: involves stretching a metal sheet over a die to create a particular shape. This process involves tension stress as the material is being stretched.
- Cutting: involves removing a portion of a metal to create a desired shape. This process involves shear stress as the material is being sliced.

Now, let's match these with the stress states listed in Column II:

- Wire Drawing: Tension stress - matches with option C (P-2)
- Forging: Compression stress - matches with option Q (Q-1)
- Stretch Forming: Tension stress - matches with option R (R-3)
- Cutting: Shear stress - matches with option S (S-4)

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) P-2; Q-1; R-3; S-4.
