We can use the formula for maximum possible reduction in rolling, which is:

Maximum possible reduction = (roll diameter) x (coefficient of friction) x (0.5) x ln(initial thickness/final thickness)

Here, the roll diameter is given as 200 mm, and the coefficient of friction is given as 0.1. The initial thickness is 250 mm, and we want to find the maximum possible reduction.

Plugging in the values, we get:

Maximum possible reduction = (200) x (0.1) x (0.5) x ln(250/final thickness)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

Maximum possible reduction = 10 x ln(250/final thickness)

To find the final thickness, we need to rearrange the equation:

ln(250/final thickness) = (maximum possible reduction)/10

Using the natural logarithm function on both sides, we get:

250/final thickness = e^((maximum possible reduction)/10)

Multiplying both sides by final thickness and dividing by e^((maximum possible reduction)/10), we get:

final thickness = 250/(e^((maximum possible reduction)/10))

Now, we can plug in the given values and solve for the maximum possible reduction:

final thickness = 250/(e^((maximum possible reduction)/10))

Simplifying this equation, we get:

e^((maximum possible reduction)/10) = 250/final thickness

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get:

((maximum possible reduction)/10) = ln(250/final thickness)

Multiplying both sides by 10, we get:

maximum possible reduction = 10 x ln(250/final thickness)

Plugging in the given values, we get:

maximum possible reduction = 10 x ln(250/0.2) â‰ˆ 250.89 mm

Therefore, the maximum possible reduction during rolling of a 250 mm thick plate is approximately 250.89 mm.

Answer: [250.89] mm (rounded to two decimal places)
