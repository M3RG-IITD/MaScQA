To determine the Miller indices of peak A in the X-ray diffraction pattern of a single-phase cubic polycrystal, we need to first understand the relationship between Miller indices and the diffraction pattern.

For a cubic crystal system, the Bragg's law can be re-written using Miller indices (h, k, l) as follows:

nλ = 2d_hkl * sinθ, where d_hkl is the inter-planar spacing, and n is an integer.

We can also obtain the lattice constant (a) of the cubic crystal by taking the square root of the following equation: 

(h^2 + k^2 + l^2) / d_hkl^2 = 1/a^2

Now, let's consider the given options:

A) (210)
In this case, h = 2, k = 1, l = 0.
So, (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) = (2^2 + 1^2 + 0^2) = 5.

B) (220)
In this case, h = 2, k = 2, l = 0.
So, (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) = (2^2 + 2^2 + 0^2) = 8.

C) (222)
In this case, h = 2, k = 2, l = 2.
So, (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) = (2^2 + 2^2 + 2^2) = 12.

D) (310)
In this case, h = 3, k = 1, l = 0.
So, (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) = (3^2 + 1^2 + 0^2) = 10.

We are looking for the lowest angle (2θ) peak, which corresponds to the lowest value of sin^2θ, because the lattice constant (a) and wavelength (λ) are going to be constant for all the options. 

From Bragg's law equation, sin^2θ is proportional to 1/(h^2 + k^2 + l^2).

So, the lowest angle peak corresponds to the largest value of (h^2 + k^2 + l^2). In our options, the largest value is 12, which belongs to option (C) (222).

Therefore, the correct answer is:

[ (C) 222 ]
