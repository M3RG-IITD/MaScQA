The interparticle neck size can be calculated using the following equation:

$γ_(SiC-SiC)$/(2$γ_(SiC-Ni)$) = $\frac{r}{d}$

where r is the radius of the neck and d is the average grain size of SiC particles.

Substituting the given values, we get:

0.80/(2 x 0.45) = r/20µm

r = 3.03 µm

Therefore, the interparticle neck size is 3.03 µm.

Answer: (A) 3.03 µm
