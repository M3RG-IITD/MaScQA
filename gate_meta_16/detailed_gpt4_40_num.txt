To solve this problem, we can use the principle of partial pressures and the relationship between the initial and final states of the system.

First, let's recall the concept of partial pressure. In a mixture of gases, each gas exerts a pressure proportional to its mole fraction. In this case, the nitrogen pressure (in mbar) corresponds to its "partial pressure" in the system.

Now let's designate the initial state of the system (State 1) and the final state of the system (State 2).

State 1:
Temperature = 1873 K
Pressure = 1 mbar
Dissolved Nitrogen = 14 ppm

State 2:
Temperature = 1873 K (Temperature remains the same)
Pressure = 0.7 mbar
Dissolved Nitrogen = x ppm

We will assume that the relationship between dissolved nitrogen content and nitrogen gas pressure is linear:

ppm_N2 / Pressure_N2 = constant

So we can write the proportion as:

(ppm_N2_State1 / Pressure_N2_State1) = (ppm_N2_State2 / Pressure_N2_State2)

We're given the values for State 1 and the pressure for State 2. We need to solve for the equilibrium nitrogen content (in ppm) for State 2, which we will represent as x ppm.

(14 ppm / 1 mbar) = (x ppm / 0.7 mbar)

To solve for x ppm, we can rearrange the equation and perform the calculation:

x ppm = (14 ppm / 1 mbar) * (0.7 mbar)

x ppm = 14 ppm * 0.7

x ppm = 9.8 ppm

So the equilibrium nitrogen content at 1873 K and 0.7 mbar is 9.8 ppm.

The correct answer is [9.8].
