We can match the entities with their dimensions as follows:

[P] Drag coefficient: Dimensionless, so it has dimensions $M^(0)L^(0)T^(0)$ --> P-3

[Q] Mass transfer coefficient: Dimensions of $M^(0)LT^(-1)$ --> Q-4

[R] Viscosity: Dimensions of $ML^(-1)T^(-1)$ --> R-1

[S] Mass flux: Dimensions of $ML^(-2)T^(-1)$ --> S-2

So the correct match is Option (A) P-3, Q-4, R-1, S-2.

Answer: [(A)]
