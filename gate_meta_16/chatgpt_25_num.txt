The maximum possible reduction during rolling can be found using the formula:

Maximum reduction = (roll diameter) x (coefficient of friction) x (plate thickness)

Substituting the given values, we get:

Maximum reduction = 200 x 0.1 x 250

Maximum reduction = 5000 mm

Therefore, the maximum possible reduction during rolling of a 250 mm thick plate is 5000 mm.

Answer: 
- 5000 mm
