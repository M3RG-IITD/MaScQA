We can use Henry's Law to solve this problem. Henry's Law states that at a constant temperature, the amount of gas dissolved in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of the gas above the liquid.

Mathematically, we can write:

P = k*C

where P is the partial pressure of the gas, C is the concentration of the gas in the liquid, and k is Henry's Law constant.

We can rearrange this equation to get:

C = P/k

We are given that at 1873 K, the equilibrium nitrogen content is 14 ppm at a pressure of 1 mbar. Therefore, we can write:

14 = 1/k

Solving for k, we get:

k = 1/14

Now, we can use this value of k to find the equilibrium nitrogen content at a pressure of 0.7 mbar. Using the equation above, we get:

C = P/k = 0.7/(1/14) = 9.8 ppm

Therefore, the equilibrium nitrogen content at a pressure of 0.7 mbar is 9.8 ppm.

Answer: [9.8]
