We have a cubic crystal with lattice parameter 'a'. The Burger's vector (b) of the dislocation is given as (a/2)[1 1 0]. The dislocation line is along the [1 1 2] direction. We are to find the angle between the dislocation line and the Burger's vector.

First, let's express the Burger's vector and the dislocation line vector in terms of their magnitudes and unit vectors:

Burger's vector (b) = (a/2)(i + j)
Dislocation line vector (t) = i + j + 2k

Now, we need to find the magnitudes of these vectors:

|b| = |(a/2)(i + j)| = (a/2)|1 + 1| = a/√2
|t| = |i + j + 2k| = √(1^2 + 1^2 + 2^2) = √6

To find the angle between the Burger's vector (b) and the dislocation line vector (t), we can use the dot product formula:

b • t = |b| |t| cos(θ)

where θ is the angle between b and t.

We can find the dot product of b and t:

b • t = ((a/2)i + (a/2)j) • (i + j + 2k) = (a/2)i • (i + j + 2k) + (a/2)j • (i + j + 2k)

b • t = ((a/2)i • i) + ((a/2)i • j) + ((a/2)i • 2k) + ((a/2)j • i) + ((a/2)j • j) + ((a/2)j • 2k)

b • t = (a/2)(1) + 0 + 0 + 0 + (a/2)(1) + 0 = a

Plugging this into the formula for the angle:

a = (a/√2)(√6)(cos(θ))
cos(θ) = a / (a√(12)/2) = a / (3a) = 1/3

θ = cos^(-1) (1/3) ≈ 70.53°

So, the angle between the Burger's vector and the dislocation line vector in the cubic crystal is approximately 70.53°.

Answer: [70.53°]
