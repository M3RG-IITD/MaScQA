Given data:
Total Fe = 92 wt.%
Metallic Fe = 84 wt.%

Let the weight percent of FeO be x. 

As per the question, DRI contains only Fe, FeO, C and gangue. Therefore, the weight percent of FeO + Metallic Fe should add up to the total Fe as follows:

Weight percent of FeO + Weight percent of Metallic Fe = Total Fe
x + 84 = 92

Solving the above equation, we get:

x = 8 wt.%

Therefore, the weight percent of FeO in DRI is 8 wt.%.

The final answer is: [8]
