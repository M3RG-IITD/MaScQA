Fatigue behaviour of an aluminium alloy is shown in the S-N plot. A piston rod made of this material is subjected to: (i) 1000 cycles at 420 MPa, followed by (ii) 1000 cycles at 300 MPa. Using Minerâ€™s rule of cumulative damage, the remaining fatigue life (in terms of number of cycles) at stress of 250 MPa is?
