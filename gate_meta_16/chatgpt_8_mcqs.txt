The possible reactions involved in the roasting of a sulfide ore of metal M are:

1. $MS + \frac{3}{2} O_2 \rightarrow MO + SO_2$
2. $2MS + 5O_2 \rightarrow 2MSO_4$

Using these reactions, we can construct a stability diagram by plotting the partial pressures of $S$, $O$, and $SO_2$ (or equivalently, $\frac{1}{p_{SO_2}}$) that correspond to the equilibrium conditions for the various solid phases. The stability diagram will have three curves that intersect at a point, which corresponds to the conditions where all four solid phases can coexist.

The stability diagram for the given reactions is:

The curves represent the conditions where the following phases are stable:

- Curve 1: $MS$ and $MO$
- Curve 2: $MO$ and $MSO_4$
- Curve 3: $MS$ and $MSO_4$

The point where all three curves intersect represents the conditions where all four solid phases can coexist, which is:

- Point X: $MS$, $MO$, $MSO_4$, and $M$

Therefore, the correct answer is:

- (A) M, MS, MO, $MSO_4$
