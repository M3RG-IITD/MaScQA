To solve this problem, we will use Miner's rule of cumulative damage. The Miner's rule states that the damage caused by different stress cycles is directly proportional to the ratio of the applied number of cycles to the total number of cycles required to cause failure under each stress condition.

We are given the following information:

1. The piston rod undergoes 1000 cycles at 420 MPa
2. The piston rod undergoes 1000 cycles at 300 MPa
3. We need to find the remaining fatigue life at a stress of 250 MPa

Let's denote the total number of cycles required to cause failure under each stress condition as:

N1 = Number of cycles at 420 MPa to cause failure
N2 = Number of cycles at 300 MPa to cause failure
N3 = Number of cycles at 250 MPa to cause failure

Also, let's denote the applied number of cycles as:

n1 = 1000 cycles at 420 MPa
n2 = 1000 cycles at 300 MPa

Now, we will use Miner's rule to calculate the fraction of fatigue life consumed at each stress level:

Damage at 420 MPa: D1 = n1 / N1
Damage at 300 MPa: D2 = n2 / N2

The total damage D_total is the sum of D1 and D2:

D_total = D1 + D2

Now, we will find the remaining fatigue life at a stress of 250 MPa. Let's denote the number of remaining cycles as N_remaining:

N_remaining = N3 * (1 - D_total)

We are not given the exact S-N curve, so we cannot determine the exact values of N1, N2, and N3. However, we can still express the remaining fatigue life in terms of the S-N curve parameters.

Let's replace the values of D1 and D2 with the corresponding ratios:

D_total = (n1 / N1) + (n2 / N2)

Now let's plug this into the remaining fatigue life equation:

N_remaining = N3 * (1 - ((n1 / N1) + (n2 / N2)))

This equation gives the remaining fatigue life at a stress of 250 MPa in terms of the S-N curve parameters (N1, N2, N3) and the applied cycles (n1, n2).

To find the exact solution, the S-N curve for the aluminum alloy must be provided to determine N1, N2, and N3. In the absence of that information, this equation is the best representation of the remaining fatigue life.

So, the answer is [N_remaining = N3 * (1 - ((n1 / N1) + (n2 / N2)))].
