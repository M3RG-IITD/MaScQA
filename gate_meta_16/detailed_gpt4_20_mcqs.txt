A) Gating:
Gating is a system of channels and gates that distribute the molten metal into the cavity of the mold during the casting process. It controls the flow of metal, helps to avoid turbulence and allows the metal to solidify properly. Therefore, gating is associated with casting.

B) Fettling:
Fettling is the process of cleaning and finishing the casting after it has solidified and cooled. This operation may involve removing excess material, grinding, polishing, and painting. As it is related to finalizing the cast product, fettling is associated with casting.

C) Stack Moulding:
Stack moulding is a type of moulding process that involves stacking two or more moulds on top of each other in the moulding machine. This method allows for increased production since multiple parts can be cast at the same time, thus making it more efficient. Therefore, stack moulding is associated with casting.

D) Calendaring:
Calendaring is a process used in the manufacturing of rubber, plastics, and paper. It involves passing the material through a series of rollers to give it a required thickness, finish, and texture. Calendaring has no direct connection to the casting process and is mainly used in other manufacturing industries.

From the above explanations, the correct answer is: 

Answer: [D) Calendaring]
