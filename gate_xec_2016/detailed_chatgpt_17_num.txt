First, we need to find the volume of a single titania particle using its density. Let us assume the diameter of the particles is 'd'.

The volume of a sphere, V = $\frac{4}{3}$ $\pi$ $r^3$, where r is the radius of the sphere.

We know that the density of the titania particle is, 

$\rho$ = $\frac{mass}{volume}$

Mass, m = volume x density

Mass, m = $\frac{4}{3}$ $\pi$ $(\frac{d}{2})^3$ x $\rho$

Now, we will find the surface area of a single particle using its specific surface area, which is given as,

Specific surface area = (surface area of all particles in 1 gm of sample) / mass of sample

125 $m^2 g^{-1}$ = $\frac{4 \pi r^2}{m}$

125 $m^2 g^{-1}$ = $\frac{4 \pi (\frac{d}{2})^2}{m}$

125 $m^2 g^{-1}$ = $\frac{d^2}{m}$

125 $m^2 g^{-1}$ = $\frac{d^2}{\frac{4}{3} \pi (\frac{d}{2})^3 \rho}$

125 $m^2 g^{-1}$ = $\frac{3d}{\rho}$

Substituting m value into this equation, we get:

125 $m^2 g^{-1}$ = $\frac{3d}{\rho}$ = $\frac{3d}{4.23}$

d = (125 x 4.23 x 3 / $\pi$)$^{0.5}$

d = 25.42 nm

Therefore, the diameter of the titania particles is 25.42 nm.

Answer: 

- 25.42 nm
