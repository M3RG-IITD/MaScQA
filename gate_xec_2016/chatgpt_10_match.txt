(B) P-3, Q-1, R-2, S-5

Explanation:

- Mechanical attrition is a process of crushing and grinding solids into fine particles, which results in the formation of nanoparticles. Hence, P-3.
- Physical vapor deposition is used to create thin films by the process of condensation of a vaporized material onto a substrate. Therefore, Q-1.
- Injection moulding is a process used to manufacture plastic products. Hence, R-2.
- Sintering is a process used in the manufacturing of hard materials, such as carbide tools, by heating the powdered material until the particles stick together. Therefore, S-5.
- Rails are not specifically produced by any of these processes.

Thus, the correct answer is (B) P-3, Q-1, R-2, S-5.
