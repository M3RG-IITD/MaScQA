We can use the Hall-Petch relationship to solve this problem, which states that the yield strength of a material is inversely proportional to the square root of its grain size:

σ_y = σ_0 + k_y * d^(-1/2)

where:
σ_y = yield strength
σ_0 = a constant
k_y = a constant called the strength coefficient
d = grain size

We can use the given information to find the values of σ_0 and k_y:

σ_y at d = 256 μm: 120 MPa
σ_y at d = 64 μm: 150 MPa

Using these values, we can solve for σ_0:

120 = σ_0 + k_y * 256^(-1/2)
150 = σ_0 + k_y * 64^(-1/2)

Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:

30 = k_y (64^(-1/2) - 256^(-1/2))
k_y = 1.44 MPa μm^(1/2)

Substituting k_y into either of the equations and solving for σ_0, we get:

σ_0 = 99.97 MPa

Now we can use the Hall-Petch relationship to find the yield strength at d = 16 μm:

σ_y at d = 16 μm = 99.97 + 1.44 * 16^(-1/2) = 187.05 MPa

Therefore, the expected yield strength when the grain size is further reduced to 16 μm is 187.05 MPa. 

Answer: 
- 187.05 MPa
