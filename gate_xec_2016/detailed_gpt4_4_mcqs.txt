Cross slip is a phenomenon in crystalline materials where a dislocation jumps from one slip plane to another intersecting slip plane. This process can help a dislocation to move around obstacles and contribute to plastic deformation.

Now let's go through each option to determine which one promotes cross-slip:

(A) A low stacking fault energy
When a metal has a low stacking fault energy (SFE), it indicates that the energy required to create a fault on the stacked planes is also low. This means that the dislocation can easily jump between the planes and create stacking faults, resulting in an increased likelihood of cross-slip. A low SFE would promote cross slip as it allows the dislocation to easily switch between the closely-spaced slip planes.

(B) A low grain boundary energy
The grain boundary energy has little influence on cross-slip, as cross slip occurs within individual grains, and it involves the motion of dislocations between slip planes, rather than the motion of grain boundaries. Low grain boundary energy would not promote cross slip.

(C) A high stacking fault energy
A high stacking fault energy means that the energy required to create a fault on the stacked planes is high. This makes it harder for dislocations to jump between the planes and create stacking faults. As a result, cross slip is less likely to occur in metals with high SFE.

(D) A high grain boundary energy
Similar to option (B), high grain boundary energy has little influence on cross-slip, as it occurs within individual grains and does not involve the motion of grain boundaries. High grain boundary energy would also not promote cross slip.

Considering the explanations above, the correct answer is:
[(A) a low stacking fault energy]
