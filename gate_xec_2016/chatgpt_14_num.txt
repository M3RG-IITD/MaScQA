The balanced equation for the reaction occurring in the cell is:

$Ni(s) + Cd^{2+}(aq) → Ni^{2+}(aq) + Cd(s)$

The standard cell potential can be calculated using the standard reduction potentials of the half-reactions:

$Eº_{cell} = Eº_{Ni^{2+}/Ni}- Eº_{Cd^{2+}/Cd}$

$Eº_{cell} = (-0.250) - (-0.403)$

$Eº_{cell} = 0.153 V$

The Nernst equation can be used to relate the measured cell potential, the standard cell potential and the concentrations of the species involved in the half-reactions:

$E_{cell} = Eº_{cell} − \frac{RT}{nF}lnQ$

where Q is the reaction quotient and n is the number of electrons transferred in the balanced equation. Since the cell potential is zero, we can simplify the equation to:

$lnQ = \frac{nF}{RT}Eº_{cell}$

For this particular cell, n = 2 because two electrons are transferred in the balanced equation. The temperature is 25°C, so we can use R = 8.31 $J mol^{−1} K^{−1}$ and F = 96500 $C mol^{−1}$. Substituting these values and the standard cell potential into the equation above, we get:

$lnQ = \frac{2 \times 96500}{8.31 \times 298} \times 0.153$

$lnQ = 1.931$

$Q = e^{1.931}$

$Q = 6.885$

Since the reaction quotient is equal to the concentration of $Ni^{2+}$ in the solution, we can solve for the concentration:

$Q = \frac{[Ni^{2+}]}{[Cd^{2+}]}$

$6.885 = \frac{[Ni^{2+}]}{1}$

$[Ni^{2+}] = 6.885 \mu M$

Therefore, the concentration of $Ni^{2+}$ in the solution is 6.885 $\mu M$.

Answer: [6.885]
