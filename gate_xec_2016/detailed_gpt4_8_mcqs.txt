To determine the maximum number of phases that can coexist in a ternary system at equilibrium, we can use the phase rule equation. The phase rule, which was formulated by J. Willard Gibbs, is a general principle that helps determine the number of phases that can coexist in equilibrium in a system involving various components.

The phase rule equation is given by:

F = C - P + 2

Where:
F = degrees of freedom or number of independent variables that can be changed without affecting the system's equilibrium.
C = number of components in the system.
P = number of phases in the system.

In a ternary system, there are three components (C = 3), and we are given that the pressure is constant, so one degree of freedom is lost. This gives us:

F = 3 - P + 2 - 1
F = 4 - P

For a system to be in equilibrium, it must have zero degrees of freedom (F = 0). Therefore, we can set F = 0 and solve for P:

0 = 4 - P
P = 4

Hence, at equilibrium, the maximum number of phases that can coexist in a ternary system at constant pressure is 4.

The correct answer is [4].
