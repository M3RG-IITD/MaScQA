The threshold wavelength can be calculated using the formula:

λ = hc/E_g

where λ is the wavelength, h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and E_g is the bandgap energy of the semiconductor.

First, we need to convert the bandgap energy from eV to joules:

E_g = 1.8 eV * (1.6 * 10^(-19) J/eV) = 2.88 * 10^(-19) J

Next, we can substitute the given values into the formula and solve for λ:

λ = (6.626 * 10^(-34) J s)(3 * 10^8 m/s)/(2.88 * 10^(-19) J) = 6.9 * 10^(-7) m

Finally, we convert to angstroms:

λ = 6.9 * 10^(-7) m * (10^10 Å/m) = 6900 Å

Therefore, the threshold value of the wavelength below which this material will absorb radiation is 6900 Å.

Answer: [6900]
