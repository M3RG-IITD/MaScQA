(Given: Universal gas constant, R = 8.31 J $mol^(−1)K^(−1)$, Faraday’s constant, F = 96500 C $mol^(−1)$). A half cell consisting of pure Ni immersed in an aqueous solution containing $Ni^(2+)$ ions of unknown concentration, is galvanically coupled with another half cell consisting of pure Cd immersed in a 1M aqueous solution of $Cd^(2+)$ ions. The temperature is 25°C and pressure is 1 atm. The standard electrode reduction potentials of Ni and Cd are −0.250 V and −0.403 V, respectively. The voltage of the cell is found to be zero. The concentration(in micro molar) of $Ni^(2+)$ in the solution is
