A tensor of rank 4 can be represented as a 4-dimensional array. Therefore, the total number of elements in this array will be the product of the sizes of each dimension. Let's say the sizes of the four dimensions are n1, n2, n3, and n4. Then the total number of elements in a rank 4 tensor is given by:

total number of elements = n1 x n2 x n3 x n4

Therefore, without knowing the sizes of the four dimensions, we cannot determine the number of elements in the tensor.

Answer: Cannot be determined without knowing the sizes of the four dimensions.
