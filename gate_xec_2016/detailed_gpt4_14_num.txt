Given the standard electrode reduction potentials of Ni and Cd are −0.250 V and −0.403 V, respectively. The cell voltage is found to be zero, which means the overall reaction is in equilibrium. We can use the Nernst equation to find the concentration of $Ni^{2+}$ in the solution.

The Nernst equation is as follows:

$E = E^{0} - \frac{RT}{nF} \ln{Q}$

where E is the cell voltage, $E^{0}$ is the standard cell voltage, R is the universal gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, n is the number of moles of electrons transferred in the reaction, F is Faraday's constant, and Q is the reaction quotient.

Since the cell voltage is zero, the Nernst equation becomes:

$0 = E_{Ni}^{0} - E_{Cd}^{0} - \frac{RT}{nF} \ln{Q}$

Before plugging in the known values, we need to convert the temperature to Kelvin:

Temperature (T) = 25°C + 273.15 = 298.15 K

Now we can plug in the values:

$0 = (-0.250) - (-0.403) - \frac{8.31 \times 298.15}{2 \times 96500} \ln{Q}$

$0 = 0.153 - \frac{2.4685 \times 10^{-4}}{2} \ln{Q}$

Solve for Q:

$\ln{Q} = \frac{0.153 \times 2}{2.4685 \times 10^{-4}}$

$\ln{Q} = 1239.5083$

Take the exponent of both sides:

$Q = e^{1239.5083}$

Since the cell reaction is:

$Ni^{2+} + Cd \rightleftharpoons Ni + Cd^{2+}$

The reaction quotient Q is:

$Q = \frac{[Cd^{2+}]}{[Ni^{2+}]} $

Given that the concentration of $Cd^{2+}$ is 1M:

$1 = \frac{[Cd^{2+}]}{[Ni^{2+}]} = \frac{1}{[Ni^{2+}]}$

Therefore, the concentration of $Ni^{2+}$ is:

$[Ni^{2+}] = \frac{1}{Q} = \frac{1}{e^{1239.5083}}$

Since the question is asking for the concentration in micro molar, we will convert the concentration into micro molar:

$[Ni^{2+}] = \frac{1}{e^{1239.5083}} \times 10^{6} \, \mu M$

However, as the exponent in this case is too big (1239.5083) and practically the answer is tending towards zero. So, the concentration would not have any significant value and technically cannot be given explicitly. Therefore, the answer comes out to be very close to 0 (approximately zero) and is negligibly small.
