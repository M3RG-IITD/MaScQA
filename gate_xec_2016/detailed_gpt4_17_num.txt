To determine the diameter of the titania nanoparticles, we will first need to find the particle volume, and then the radius.

Step 1: Calculate the particle volume
Specific surface area is defined as the surface area per unit mass, which can be expressed as:

Specific surface area = Surface area / Mass

We know that the surface area of a sphere is given by:

Surface area = 4 * π * r^2

We also know that the mass of a sphere can be given by:

Mass = Density * Volume

For a sphere, Volume = (4/3) * π * r^3

So, Mass = Density * (4/3) * π * r^3

Now, we can substitute these expressions into the specific surface area equation:

Specific surface area = (4 * π * r^2) / (Density * (4/3) * π * r^3)

Step 2: Calculate the radius
We are given the specific surface area (125 m^2 g^(-1)) and the density (4.23 g cm^(-3)), so we can solve for the radius (r) in the above equation:

125 = (4 * π * r^2) / (4.23 * (4/3) * π * r^3)

First, we can cancel out the π from both the numerator and the denominator:

125 = (4 * r^2) / (4.23 * (4/3) * r^3)

Next, multiply both sides of the equation by (4.23 * (4/3) * r^3) to get rid of the denominator:

125 * (4.23 * (4/3) * r^3) = 4 * r^2

Dividing both sides by 4, we get:

(125 * 4.23 * (4/3) * r^3) / 4 = r^2

Multiplying both sides by 3, we get:

(125 * 4.23 * 4 * r^3) = 3 * r^2

Now, divide both sides by 12 to obtain:

(125 * 4.23 * r^3) = r^2

Given that the density is in g cm^(-3) and specific surface area is in m^2 g^(-1), it's necessary to convert the density to m^2.

4.23 g/cm³ = 4.23 * 10^6 g/m³

Substituting the given values:

(125 * (4.23 * 10^6) * r^3) = r^2

Solving for r:

r = sqrt(125 / (4.23 * 10^6))
r ≈ 6.09 * 10^(-9) m

Step 3: Calculate the diameter
Now that we have the radius, we can find the diameter by multiplying the radius by 2:

Diameter (d) = 2 * r
d ≈ 2 * 6.09 * 10^(-9) m

Converting the diameter to nm:

d ≈ 12.18 * 10^(-9) * (10^9 nm/m)
d ≈ 12.18 nm

Answer: The diameter of the particles is approximately [12.18] nm.
