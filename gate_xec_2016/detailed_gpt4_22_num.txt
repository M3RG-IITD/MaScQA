1. First, we need to understand the concept of crystallographic directions. In a cubic system, the crystallographic directions are denoted as [uvw], where u, v, and w are the direction indices corresponding to the x, y, and z axes, respectively. These indices describe the direction of a vector in terms of the unit cell's edge lengths.

2. The given directions are [110] and [111]. To calculate the angle between these directions, we can use the dot product formula of vectors:

   A · B = |A| |B| cos(θ)

where A · B is the dot product of the two direction vectors A and B, |A| and |B| are their magnitudes, and θ is the angle between them.

3. For the [110] direction, A = (1, 1, 0), and for the [111] direction, B = (1, 1, 1).

4. Let's calculate the dot product A · B:

   A · B = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (0)(1) = 1 + 1 = 2

5. Now, let's calculate the magnitudes |A| and |B|:

   |A| = √((1)^2 + (1)^2 + (0)^2) = √(1 + 1) = √2

   |B| = √((1)^2 + (1)^2 + (1)^2) = √(1 + 1 + 1) = √3

6. Now let's plug these values into the dot product formula:

   2 = (√2)(√3) cos(θ)
   
   cos(θ) = 2 / (√2 * √3)
   
   cos(θ) = 2 / (√6)

7. To find θ, we can take the inverse cosine (arccos) of cos(θ):

   θ = arccos(2 / √6)

8. Computing this value, we get:

   θ ≈ 54.7°

Therefore, the angle between the [110] and [111] directions in the cubic system is approximately 54.7°.

Answer: [54.7]
