The angle between the two directions can be found using the dot product formula,

cosθ = a . b / |a||b|

where a and b are the two directions and |a| and |b| are their magnitudes. Since both [110] and [111] are unit vectors in the cubic system, their magnitudes are equal to 1.

Taking a = [110] and b = [111], we get:

cosθ = (1 x 1 + 1 x 1 + 0 x 1) / (1 x 1 x √2) = 2 / √2 = √2

Therefore, θ = cos⁻¹(√2) ≈ 35.26°

Answer: The angle between [110] and [111] directions in the cubic system is approximately 35.26 degrees.
