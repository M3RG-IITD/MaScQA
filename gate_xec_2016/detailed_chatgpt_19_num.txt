To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the number of moles of sulfur and rubber. 

Number of moles of sulfur = 10 g / 32 g/mol = 0.3125 mol 

Number of moles of rubber = 50 g / 68 g/mol = 0.7353 mol 

Since the mer to S ratio is 1:1, the maximum number of cross-linked sites that could be connected is equal to the number of moles of sulfur (0.3125 mol). 

Assuming every sulfur atom connects two rubber chains, the maximum number of cross-linked sites that could be formed is: 

0.3125 mol S * 2 cross-links/mol S = 0.625 cross-links 

The total number of sites available for cross-linking would be: 

0.7353 mol rubber * 6 sites/mer = 4.41 sites 

Therefore, the maximum percentage of cross-linked sites that could be connected is: 

(0.625 cross-links / 4.41 total sites) * 100% = 14.16% 

Answer: 

- 14.16%
