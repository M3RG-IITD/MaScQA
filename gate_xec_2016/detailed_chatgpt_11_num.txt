The BCC (Body Centered Cubic) structure has the following form:

Assuming that the X-rays are incident perpendicular to the plane of the material, the Bragg's law equation can be used to determine the position of the first diffraction peak:

nλ = 2dsinθ

where n is an integer representing the order of diffraction, λ is the wavelength of the X-rays, d is the interatomic spacing between the planes in the crystal lattice, and θ is the angle of diffraction.

For the BCC structure, the first diffraction peak will be from the (110) plane. The interatomic spacing between the (110) planes can be determined using the lattice parameter a:

d = a / sqrt(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)

where h, k, and l are the Miller indices that define the plane of interest. For the (110) plane, h = 1, k = 1, and l = 0.

Therefore, 
d = 4.1 Å / sqrt(1^2 + 1^2 + 0^2) 
d = 4.1 Å / sqrt(2) 
d = 2.91 Å 

Now we can substitute the values of n, λ, and d into Bragg's law to find θ:

nλ = 2dsinθ
1 * 1.54 Å = 2 * 2.91 Å * sinθ
sinθ = 0.265
θ = 15.3°

Therefore, the angular position θ of the first diffraction peak is 15.3°.

Answer: [15.3]
