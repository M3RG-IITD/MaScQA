To determine the angular position of the first diffraction peak in a material with a BCC (Body-Centered Cubic) structure, we can use Bragg's Law and the equation for the interplanar spacing(d) in a Body-Centered Cubic structure.

Bragg's Law is given as:

nλ = 2d sin(θ)

where,
n = order of the diffraction (in this case, we will consider the first diffraction peak, so n = 1)
λ = wavelength of X-rays used (1.54 Å)
d = interplanar spacing
θ = angle of diffraction (to be determined)

The interplanar spacing (d) in a BCC structure can be calculated using the equation:

d = a / √(h² + k² + l²)

where,
a = lattice parameter (4.1 Å)
h, k, l = Miller indices

In the BCC structure, the diffraction conditions are that the sum of the Miller indices h+k+l should be an even number (this results in constructive interference). The first set of indices that satisfy this condition and give the lowest value for the interplanar spacing is (h,k,l) = (1,1,0). This means that h=1, k=1, and l=0.

Now, we can calculate d using the given lattice parameter (a) and the Miller indices:

d = 4.1 / √(1² + 1² + 0²) = 4.1 / √(1 + 1) = 4.1 / √2 ≈ 2.8983 Å

Now that we have d, we can plug the values back into Bragg's Law to find the angle of diffraction (θ):

1 * 1.54 = 2 * 2.8983 * sin(θ)

Solving for sin(θ):

sin(θ) = (1.54) / (2 * 2.8983) ≈ 0.2658

Now, we can find the angle of diffraction (θ) in degrees:

θ = arcsin(0.2658) ≈ 15.4°

So, the angular position of the first diffraction peak for this BCC material with a lattice parameter of 4.1 Å when using monochromatic X-rays of wavelength 1.54 Å is approximately 15.4°.
