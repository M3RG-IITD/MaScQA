To answer this question, let's understand some basic definitions about transparency, translucency, and opacity first.

- Transparent: A transparent material allows light to pass through it without significantly scattering or changing the direction of the light rays. As a result, objects can be clearly seen through the material.

- Translucent: A translucent material allows some light to pass through it, but the light is scattered as it enters the material, making it difficult or impossible to clearly see objects through the material.

- Opaque: An opaque material does not allow light to pass through it. No light is transmitted or scattered through the material, and objects cannot be seen through it.

Now, let's discuss the question.

Sapphire is a single crystal form of alumina (Al2O3). It is known for its hardness, stability at high temperatures, and resistance to chemical attack. These properties make it useful in various applications, including transparent armor, optical components, and electronic substrates.

When defect-free, single crystal alumina (sapphire) is:

(A) Opaque and white: This option is incorrect because defect-free sapphire is known for its transparency or translucency, depending on the crystal's thickness, orientation, and purity. Opaque materials do not allow light to pass through, while sapphire does.

(B) Transparent: This option is correct. Defect-free single crystal alumina (sapphire) is transparent, allowing light to pass through the material without significantly scattering it. This makes it possible to clearly see objects through the material, giving sapphire its well-known clarity and ability to be used in various optical applications.

(C) Translucent: This option is incorrect because defect-free single crystal alumina (sapphire) is generally not translucent, which would involve scattering light significantly, while sapphire is known for its transparency and clarity.

(D) Opaque and black: This option is incorrect because defect-free single crystal alumina (sapphire) is not opaque, which means it allows light to pass through. Black sapphire does exist, but it consists of trace elements that contribute to the color and opacity of the material, making it different from pure, defect-free single crystal alumina.

So, the correct answer is:

[B]
