In the photoelectric effect, electrons are ejected
(A) at all wavelengths, as long as the intensity of the incident radiation is above a threshold value. (B) at all wavelengths, as long as the intensity of the incident radiation is below a threshold value. (C) at all intensities, as long as the wavelength of the incident radiation is below a threshold value. (D) at all intensities, as long as the wavelength of the incident radiation is above a threshold value
