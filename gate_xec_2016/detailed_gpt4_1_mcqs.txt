Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) is a technique used to perform elemental identification and quantitative analysis of a sample in a scanning electron microscope (SEM). It works by measuring the characteristic X-rays emitted by the sample when it is bombarded by an electron beam.

When an electron beam is focused on a specimen in an SEM, several interactions occur between the electrons and the atoms of the sample, leading to the production of various signals. These include secondary electrons, backscattered electrons, characteristic X-rays, and diffracted electrons.

Let's analyze each option:

(A) Secondary electrons from the sample: These are low energy electrons that are ejected from the sample due to inelastic scattering of the incident electron beam. Secondary electrons are mainly used for imaging topographical features of the sample, but they don't provide elemental information.

(B) Backscattered electrons from the sample: These are high-energy electrons that are scattered back from the sample after elastic interactions with the atoms. Backscattered electrons provide information about the sample's composition, but they are not used in EDS for elemental identification.

(C) Characteristic X-rays from the sample: When the electron beam interacts with the sample, it can displace electrons from the inner shells of the atoms. These vacancies are filled by electrons from higher energy levels, resulting in the emission of X-rays with characteristic energies specific to the element. By collecting and analyzing these characteristic X-rays, EDS can determine the elemental composition of the sample.

(D) Diffraction pattern from the sample: Diffracted electrons are produced when the incident electron beam interacts with the crystal structure of the sample. This technique is used in electron diffraction studies for determining crystallographic structure and orientation, but it does not provide elemental information.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
