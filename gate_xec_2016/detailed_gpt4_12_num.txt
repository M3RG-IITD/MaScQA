To solve this problem, we need to use the Hall-Petch equation, which describes the relationship between the yield strength of a material and its grain size:

σ_y = σ_0 + k * d^(-1/2)

where σ_y is the yield strength, σ_0 is the material constant, k is the Hall-Petch constant, and d is the grain size.

We are given two sets of yield strengths (σ_y) and grain sizes (d) and asked to find the yield strength when the grain size is further reduced to 16 μm.

First, let us write the Hall-Petch equation for the initial yield strength and grain size:

σ_y1 = σ_0 + k * d1^(-1/2)

where σ_y1 = 120 MPa and d1 = 256 μm.

Next, let us write the Hall-Petch equation for the final yield strength and grain size:

σ_y2 = σ_0 + k * d2^(-1/2)

where σ_y2 = 150 MPa and d2 = 64 μm.

Now, we will solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of σ_0 and k.

(1) 120 = σ_0 + k * (256)^(-1/2)
(2) 150 = σ_0 + k * (64)^(-1/2)

We can rewrite these equations as:

(1) σ_0 = 120 - k * (256)^(-1/2)
(2) σ_0 = 150 - k * (64)^(-1/2)

Now, set the two expressions for σ_0 equal to each other:

120 - k * (256)^(-1/2) = 150 - k * (64)^(-1/2)

Rearrange the equation to isolate k:

k * (64)^(-1/2) - k * (256)^(-1/2) = 150 - 120

k * (1/(64^(1/2)) - 1/(256^(1/2))) = 30

Now, we can plug in the given values for the grain sizes:

k * (1/8 - 1/16) = 30

k * (1/16) = 30

Now, solve for k:

k = 30 * 16
k = 480

Now, we can plug the value of k back into either equation (1) or (2) to solve for σ_0:

σ_0 = 120 - 480 * (256)^(-1/2)

σ_0 = 120 - 480 * (1/16)

σ_0 = 120 - 30

σ_0 = 90

Now that we have the values for σ_0 and k, we can use the Hall-Petch equation to find the expected yield strength when the grain size is reduced to 16 μm:

σ_y = 90 + 480 * (16)^(-1/2)

σ_y = 90 + 480 * (1/4)

σ_y = 90 + 120

σ_y = 210 MPa

So, the expected yield strength when the grain size is further reduced to 16 μm is 210 MPa.

The correct answer is [210].
