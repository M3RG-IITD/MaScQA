To find the number of elements in a tensor of rank 4, we must know the dimensions along each axis of the tensor. A tensor of rank 4 can be thought of as a 4-dimensional array, where each axis has a specific number of elements. Let's denote the dimensions along each axis by the variables a, b, c, and d. For example, if the dimensions of the tensor were 2x3x4x5, a would be 2, b would be 3, c would be 4, and d would be 5. 

Now, to find the total number of elements in the tensor, we simply multiply the dimensions along each axis together. 

Number of elements = a * b * c * d

For our example with dimensions 2x3x4x5, the number of elements would be:

Number of elements = 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120

So, without knowing the exact dimensions of the tensor of rank 4 you're referring to, we cannot provide a specific numerical answer. But the general formula for the number of elements in a tensor of rank 4 is given by:

Number of elements = a * b * c * d
