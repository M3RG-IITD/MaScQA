We can use Fick's second law of diffusion to solve this problem. The equation is:

ΔC/Δt = D * (Δ^2C/Δx^2)

where ΔC/Δt is the rate of change of concentration with respect to time, D is the diffusion coefficient, and Δ^2C/Δx^2 is the rate of change of concentration with respect to distance.

At steady state, the rate of change of concentration is zero, so we can set ΔC/Δt = 0. We also know that the concentration at a depth of $10^(−3)$ cm is half the surface concentration. Let's call the surface concentration Cs, then the concentration at a depth of $10^(−3)$ cm is Cs/2. We can assume that the wafer is initially at a uniform Cs concentration, so the initial condition is:

C(x,0) = Cs          where x = 0 to x = ∞

The boundary condition is:

C(0,t) = Cs         at the surface of the wafer, where x = 0

C($10^(−3)$,t) = Cs/2   at a depth of $10^(−3)$ cm, where x = $10^(−3)$ cm

We can solve this problem using the complementary error function:

C(x,t) = (Cs/2) + (Cs/2) * erf(x/(2*sqrt(D*t)))

At the boundary condition, x = 0:

Cs = (Cs/2) + (Cs/2) * erf(0)

erf(0) = 0, so Cs/2 = Cs/2, which is true

At the other boundary condition, x = $10^(−3)$ cm:

Cs/2 = (Cs/2) + (Cs/2) * erf($10^(−3)$/(2*sqrt(D*t)))

erf($10^(−3)$/(2*sqrt(D*t))) = 1/2

$10^(−3)$/sqrt(D*t) = sqrt(2)

t = (($10^(−3)^(2))/(2*D)) = 8.3 seconds (rounded to two significant figures)

Therefore, the time the silicon wafer should be heated in contact with gallium vapor at 1355°C is 8.3 seconds.

Answer: 

- 8.3 seconds
