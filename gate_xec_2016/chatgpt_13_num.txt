The formula to calculate the threshold value of the wavelength is given by:

$$
\lambda_{th} = \frac{hc}{E_{g} e}
$$

where $E_{g}$ is the bandgap energy.

Substituting the given values:

$$
\lambda_{th} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34}\text{ J s})(3 \times 10^{8} \text{ m s}^{-1})}{(1.8 \text{ eV})(1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C})}
$$

$$
\lambda_{th} \approx 3441.67 \text{ Å}
$$

Therefore, the threshold value of the wavelength below which this material will absorb radiation is approximately 3441.67 Å.

Answer: 
- 3441.67 Å
