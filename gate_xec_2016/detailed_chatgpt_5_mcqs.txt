The Fermi energy is defined as the energy level for which the probability of occupancy is 0.5. 

Explanation:
In a metal at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, the electrons are distributed according to the Fermi-Dirac distribution, which gives the probability of finding an electron at a given energy level. The Fermi energy is defined as the energy level for which the Fermi-Dirac distribution is 0.5. At this energy level, there is an equal probability of finding an electron or a hole (an empty state), which is why the energy level is often referred to as the Fermi level. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 0.5.
