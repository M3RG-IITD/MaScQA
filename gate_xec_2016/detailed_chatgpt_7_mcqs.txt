The answer to this question is (B) Seebeck.

Explanation:

A thermocouple is a device that converts thermal energy directly into electrical energy. It is based on the principle of Seebeck effect. The Seebeck effect is the production of an electromotive force (EMF) and hence a current in a circuit of two dissimilar metals, when there is a temperature difference between their junctions. When two dissimilar metals are joined together to form a closed circuit, and one junction is heated and the other junction is maintained at a constant temperature, a potential difference is generated between the two junctions. This potential difference is proportional to the temperature difference between the two junctions.

In a thermocouple, the two dissimilar metals are usually joined together as two legs of a circuit, and the temperature difference is created by heating one junction of the two legs. The other junction, called the cold junction, is usually maintained at a constant temperature, often by using an ice bath. The potential difference generated by the thermocouple is measured by a voltmeter, and the temperature difference is determined from the calibration of the thermocouple.
