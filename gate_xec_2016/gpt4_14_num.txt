Given the voltage of the cell is zero, we can say that the cell is in equilibrium. In this case, we can use the Nernst equation to find the concentration of $Ni^{2+}$ ions in the solution.

The Nernst equation is:
$$E_{cell} = E^0_{cell} - \frac{RT}{nF} * ln(Q)$$

Since the cell voltage is zero, we can rewrite the equation as:
$$0 = E^0_{cell} - \frac{RT}{nF} * ln(Q)$$

$E_{cell}^0$ is the difference between the standard reduction potentials of the two cells which can be calculated as:

$$E_{cell}^0 = E_{Ni}^0 - E_{Cd}^0 = (-0.250) - (-0.403) = 0.153 V$$

The number of electrons involved in the redox reaction, $n$, is 2 as both $Ni$ and $Cd$ have 2+ charge.

Now, we can plug the given values into the Nernst equation:
$$0 = 0.153 - \frac{8.31 J mol^{-1}K^{-1} * 298.15 K}{2 * 96500 C mol^{-1}} * ln(Q)$$

We know that $Q$ (the reaction quotient) for this cell is:
$$Q = \frac{[Ni^{2+}]}{[Cd^{2+}]}$$

Since the concentration of $Cd^{2+}$ is given as 1 M, we can write $Q$ as:
$$Q = [Ni^{2+}]$$

Now we can solve for $[Ni^{2+}]$:

$$0 = 0.153 - \frac{8.31 * 298.15}{2 * 96500} * ln([Ni^{2+}])$$

$$0.153 = \frac{8.31 * 298.15}{2 * 96500} * ln([Ni^{2+}])$$

$$ln([Ni^{2+}]) = \frac{0.153 * 2 * 96500}{8.31 * 298.15}$$

$$[Ni^{2+}] = e^{\frac{0.153 * 2 * 96500}{8.31 * 298.15}}$$

$$[Ni^{2+}] \approx 1.19 * 10^{-5} M$$

Now, we convert the concentration to micro molar:

$$[Ni^{2+}] \approx 1.19 * 10^{-5} * 10^{6} \mu M$$

$$[Ni^{2+}] \approx 11.9 \mu M$$

Therefore, the concentration of $Ni^{2+}$ in the solution is approximately 11.9 ÂµM. The final answer is [11.9].
