To find the maximum percentage of cross-linked sites, we'll first find the moles of natural rubber and sulfur.

Moles of natural rubber (NR) = mass / molecular weight
Moles of NR = 50 g / 68 amu = 0.735 moles

Moles of sulfur (S) = mass / atomic weight
Moles of S = 10 g / 32 amu = 0.3125 moles

Since the assumption is that the mer to S ratio is 1:1, and there are fewer moles of sulfur than natural rubber, the sulfur will be the limiting reagent. The maximum number of cross-linked sites will be equal to the number of sulfur atoms.

Percentage of cross-linked sites = (moles of sulfur / moles of natural rubber) * 100
Percentage of cross-linked sites = (0.3125 / 0.735) * 100 â‰ˆ 42.517%

The maximum percentage of cross-linked sites that could be connected is approximately [42.52%].
