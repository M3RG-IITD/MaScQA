Given, 

Specific surface area of titania nanoparticles = 125 $m^2$ $g^{−1}$ 

Density of titania = 4.23 g $cm^{−3}$ 


We know that, 

 Specific surface area = Surface area / mass 

 Surface area of a sphere = 4πr^2 

 Mass of the sphere = Density * Volume * (4/3)πr^3 

So, combining the above equations we get, 

 Specific surface area = 3 / (density * diameter) 

which gives, 

 Diameter of the titania nanoparticle = 3 / (density * specific surface area) 

 Substituting the values, we get 

 Diameter of the titania nanoparticle = 3 /(4.23 * 125) nm 

   = 0.0181 nm 

Therefore, the diameter of the titania nanoparticle is 0.0181 nm.

Answer: [0.0181 nm]
