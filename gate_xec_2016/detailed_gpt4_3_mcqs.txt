In a second-order phase transition, there is a discontinuity in the second derivative of the Gibbs free energy (G) with respect to temperature (T) or pressure (P). The second-order phase transition is associated with a discontinuity in the response functions, which are the second derivatives of the thermodynamic potential.

Recall that the Gibbs free energy (G) is related to the enthalpy (H), the temperature (T), and the entropy (S) as follows:

G = H - TS

Differentiating G with respect to T, while keeping the pressure (P) constant, we get:

(∂G/∂T)_P = (∂H/∂T)_P - T(∂S/∂T)_P - S

Recall that the heat capacity at constant pressure (C_P) is defined as:

C_P = T(∂S/∂T)_P

Therefore, the equation can be rewritten as:

 ( ∂G/∂T)_P = (∂H/∂T)_P - C_P - S

Now differentiate this equation once more with respect to T:

(∂^2G/∂T^2)_P = (∂^2H/∂T^2)_P - (∂C_P/∂T)_P - (∂S/∂T)_P

During a second-order phase transition, the second derivative of G with respect to T has a discontinuity. That means at least one term in the equation above must also have a discontinuity. The volume (Option A) and enthalpy (Option B) are first-order derivatives, while entropy (Option C) is a first-order state function which does not show any discontinuity during a second-order phase transition. Therefore, they can all be ruled out.

However, the heat capacity (Option D) is directly related to the second derivative of G with respect to T, as it is involved in the derivatives in the equation above, and thus will show a discontinuity during a second-order phase transition. 

Answer: [D] Heat capacity
