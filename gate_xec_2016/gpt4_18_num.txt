To find the probability that the random variable x takes a value between 1 and √5, we need to find the area under the probability distribution function (pdf) in the given interval. Since f(x) = 0.25x for 1 ≤ x ≤ 3, we need to integrate f(x) in the interval [1, √5]:

∫(0.25x dx) from 1 to √5

Let's first set u = 0.25x, then du = 0.25 dx.

Now, the integral becomes:

∫(u du) from 0.25(1) to 0.25(√5)

Now we can take the integral:

(1/2)u^2 | 0.25 to 0.25√5

Substituting the bounds:

(1/2)(0.25√5)^2 - (1/2)(0.25)^2

(1/2)(0.0625*5 - 0.0625)

(1/2)(0.3125 - 0.0625)

(1/2)(0.25)

The probability that the random variable x takes a value between 1 and √5 is:

0.125

Hence, the answer is [0.125].
