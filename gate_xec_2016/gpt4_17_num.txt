To find the diameter of the spherical titania nanoparticles, we need to use the specific surface area formula:

Specific Surface Area (SSA) = 6 / (density x diameter)

Given:
SSA = 125 m²/g
Density = 4.23 g/cm³ (in g/m³, multiply by 1e6 so, 4.23×10⁶ g/m³)

Let's find the diameter.

1. Rearrange the equation to solve for diameter:
Diameter = 6 / (density x SSA)

2. Plug in the values:
Diameter = 6 / (4.23×10⁶ g/m³ x 125 m²/g)

3. Simplify the equation:
Diameter = 6 / (5.2875×10⁸)

4. Calculate the Diameter in meters:
Diameter = 1.135×10⁻⁹ m

5. Convert Diameter to nanometers (1 m = 1e9 nm):
Diameter = 1.135×10⁻⁹×10⁹ nm

6. Diameter = 1.135nm

The diameter of the spherical titania nanoparticles is approximately 1.135 nm.

Answer: [1.135].
