To solve this question, we need to understand the basic concept of different types of magnetism and their corresponding materials.

Group 1: [P: Ferromagnetic, Q: Ferrimagnetic, R: Antiferromagnetic, S: Paramagnetic]

Group 2: [1: Nickel oxide, 2: Sodium, 3: Magnetite, 4: Cobalt]

1. Ferromagnetic materials: In these materials, magnetic moments spontaneously align parallel to each other even in the absence of an external magnetic field. Common examples include iron, cobalt, and nickel. So, P corresponds to 4 (Cobalt).

2. Ferrimagnetic materials: In these materials, magnetic moments are aligned non-uniformly, resulting in an overall net magnetic moment. A common example is magnetite. Thus, Q corresponds to 3 (Magnetite).

3. Antiferromagnetic materials: In these materials, magnetic moments are aligned in a staggered manner. A common example is nickel oxide. Hence, R must correspond to 1 (Nickel oxide).

4. Paramagnetic materials: In these materials, magnetic moments align with an external magnetic field, but revert back to a random state once the field is removed. A common example is sodium. Thus, S corresponds to 2 (Sodium).

So, the correct matching is P-4, Q-3, R-1, and S-2.

The correct answer is (A) P-4, Q-3, R-1, S-2.
