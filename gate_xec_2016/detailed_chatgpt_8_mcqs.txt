The maximum number of phases that can coexist in a ternary system at constant pressure can be determined from the Gibbs phase rule, which is given by:

    F = C - P + 2

where F is the degrees of freedom (the maximum number of intensive variables that can be independently varied without changing the number of phases), C is the number of components, and P is the number of phases.

For a ternary system (C = 3), the Gibbs phase rule becomes:

    F = 3 - P + 2
    F = 5 - P

To determine the maximum number of phases that can coexist at equilibrium, we need to find the value of F when it is equal to zero (i.e., when all the intensive variables are fixed and the system is at equilibrium). Setting F = 0, we get:

    0 = 5 - P
    P = 5

Therefore, the maximum number of phases that can coexist in a ternary system at constant pressure is 5.
