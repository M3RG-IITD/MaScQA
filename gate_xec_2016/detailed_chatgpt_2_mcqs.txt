In a perfectly periodic 3-dimensional lattice, the basic unit cell must be identical at each lattice point. Therefore, any rotation that does not leave the lattice invariant is forbidden since it would result in a structure that is not identical at every lattice point. 

(A) 1-fold rotational symmetry is allowed, as any object will have 1-fold rotational symmetry. 

(B) 3-fold rotational symmetry is allowed, as there are crystals that are helical, and have three-fold symmetry around the helical axis. 

(C) 5-fold rotational symmetry is not allowed, due to the fact that five-fold symmetry is not compatible with translational symmetry along three directions.

(D) 6-fold rotational symmetry is allowed, as there are structures such as cuboctahedral crystals with six-fold symmetry that can fit within a periodic 3-dimensional lattice.

Therefore, the answer is (C) 5-fold.
