To solve this question, it's important to review the key ideas of the photoelectric effect. 

The photoelectric effect is the phenomenon by which electrons are ejected from the surface of a material when it is illuminated by light of a certain frequency or wavelength. It was first explained by Albert Einstein in 1905, and his explanation of this effect helped establish the particle nature of light, which is now believed to exist as both a particle (photon) and a wave.

The explanation of the photoelectric effect depends on the concept of the photon, the quantum of light. Photons have particle-like characteristics, such as distinct energies that depend on their frequency. The energy of a photon is given by the relationship:

E = h*f, 

where E is the energy of the photon, h is Planck's constant, and f is the frequency of the light.

Now, let's examine the answer choices:

(A) at all wavelengths, as long as the intensity of the incident radiation is above a threshold value.

The photoelectric effect is not dependent on the intensity of the light, as increasing intensity simply increases the number of photons, not individual photon's energy. So, this statement is incorrect.

(B) at all wavelengths, as long as the intensity of the incident radiation is below a threshold value.

This choice is also incorrect as, mentioned before, the effect is not dependent on the intensity of the light.

(C) at all intensities, as long as the wavelength of the incident radiation is below a threshold value.

This choice seems more reasonable, as the photoelectric effect is based on the wavelength (or frequency) of the incident light. The threshold wavelength corresponds to the minimum energy required to eject an electron from the material. If the incident light has a wavelength below the threshold value, its photons will have enough energy to eject electrons. This is regardless of how many photons are present (intensity). So, this statement appears correct.

(D) at all intensities, as long as the wavelength of the incident radiation is above a threshold value.

This choice is incorrect because if the wavelength of the incident radiation is above the threshold value, the photons will not have enough energy to eject electrons, regardless of the intensity.

So, based on our analysis, the correct answer is:

[C]
