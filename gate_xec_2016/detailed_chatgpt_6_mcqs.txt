To find the number of elements in a tensor of rank 4, we need to consider four indices. Let's assume the tensor dimensions as $n_1 \times n_2 \times n_3 \times n_4$. 

Then the number of elements in the tensor is given by the product of all the dimensions, i.e., 

$$n_1 \times n_2 \times n_3 \times n_4$$

Therefore, the number of elements in a tensor of rank 4 is the product of its 4 dimensions.

Mathematically, we can represent it as:

Number of elements $= \prod\limits_{i=1}^4 n_i$

So, the answer to the question is:

- Number of elements in a tensor of rank 4 is $\prod\limits_{i=1}^4 n_i$
