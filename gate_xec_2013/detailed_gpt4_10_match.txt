To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties and applications of each ceramic material.

P. Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT) - This is a piezoelectric material, which means it can generate an electric charge when subjected to mechanical stress or vice versa. Therefore, it is typically used in actuators, sensors, and transducers.

Q. Zinc Oxide (ZnO) - Zinc oxide is a well-known semiconductor and shows good electrical characteristics. It has the property of non-linear current-voltage behavior, which makes them suitable for applications like varistors, which are devices used to protect electrical circuits from overvoltage conditions.

R. Silicon Carbide (SiC) - Silicon Carbide is known for its strength and high-temperature stability. It has a very high hardness and wear resistance which makes it an excellent material to make cutting tools and other wear-resistant applications.

S. Zirconia ($ZrO_2$) - Due to its high melting point, low thermal conductivity, and chemical inertness, Zirconia is used as a thermal barrier coating material to protect components exposed to high temperatures like turbines and engine parts.

Now let's match these properties and applications:

P: PZT - 3. Actuator (Piezoelectric property)
Q: ZnO - 4. Varistor (Non-linear current-voltage behavior)
R: SiC - 1. Cutting Tool (High hardness and wear resistance)
S: $ZrO_2$ - 2. Thermal Barrier Coating (High melting point, low thermal conductivity)

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) P-3, Q-4, R-1, S-2.
