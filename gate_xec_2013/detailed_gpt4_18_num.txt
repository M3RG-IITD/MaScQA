It seems that there is no figure and data provided for the problem. In order to solve this problem, I would need the following information:

1. The stress-strain curve of the material.
2. The yield stress of the material.
3. The ultimate tensile strength of the material.
4. The fracture stress of the material.

Nevertheless, I can provide you with a general approach to solving the problem once you have the required information:

1. Understand the stress-strain curve: The stress-strain curve provides information about how the material behaves under increasing stress. The curve for the tensile test typically starts at the origin and goes through the elastic and plastic deformation regions before reaching the fracture point.

2. Calculate the area under the stress-strain curve: The toughness of a material is indicated by the area under the stress-strain curve. In most cases, the stress-strain curve has a complex shape and requires numerical integration or other methods such as the Trapezoidal Rule or Simpson's Rule to calculate the area accurately. However, in this particular case, the material exhibits linear work hardening, which means that the stress-strain curve consists of straight-line segments. This simplifies the calculation of the area.

3. Use the data provided to calculate the area under the curve: Since the material exhibits linear work hardening, the stress-strain curve can be divided into three regions: elastic deformation, plastic deformation with linear work hardening, and the final segment leading to the fracture point.

4. Calculate the area for each region by considering each segment as geometric shapes and then summing up the areas:
  a. For the elastic deformation region, the area can be calculated as the triangle formed by the (0,0) point, the point of the yield stress, and the point where the elastic deformation ends (by proportionality with Young's modulus).
  b. For the plastic deformation with linear work hardening region, the area can be calculated as the trapezoid formed by the yield stress point, the ultimate tensile strength point, and the corresponding points on the strain axis.
  c. For the final segment leading to fracture point, the area can be calculated as a small triangle formed by the ultimate tensile strength point, the fracture stress point, and the point on the strain axis corresponding to the strain at the fracture point.

5. Multiply the calculated area by a unit conversion factor to express the toughness in M J $m^(-3)$.

Please provide the necessary data for the problem so that I can provide a more accurate and specific solution.
