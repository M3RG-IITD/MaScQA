To answer this question, let's first understand the fluorite structure.

Fluorite structure is a common structure for ionic compounds where the cations form a face-centered cubic lattice and the anions occupy all the tetrahedral sites in the lattice. The general formula for a fluorite structure can be written as $AB_2$ or $A_1B_2$, where A is the cation and B is the anion.

Now let's examine each option.

(A) $UO_2$
$UO_2$ has the formula $A_1B_2$, where A is the uranium (U) cation, and B is the oxide (O) anion. Uranium dioxide crystallizes in a fluorite structure, where uranium atoms form a face-centered cubic lattice, and oxide anions occupy all the tetrahedral sites. So, this is a possible answer.

(B) MgO
MgO has the formula $AB$, where A is the magnesium (Mg) cation, and B is the oxide (O) anion. It forms a rocksalt (NaCl-type) crystal structure instead of a fluorite structure. So, this option is not correct.

(C) $BaTiO_3$
$BaTiO_3$ has the formula $ABO_3$, where A is the barium (Ba) cation, B is the titanium (Ti) cation, and O is the oxide anion. It forms a perovskite structure, which is different from the fluorite structure. So, this option is not correct.

(D) $MgAl_2O_4$
$MgAl_2O_4$ has the formula $A^I_1B^{II}_2O_4$, where A is the magnesium (Mg) cation, B is the aluminum (Al) cation, and O is the oxide anion. It forms a spinel structure, where magnesium and aluminum atoms are distributed between tetrahedral and octahedral sites in a face-centered cubic lattice, and the oxide anions form a close-packed structure. So, this option is not correct.

Based on our analysis, the correct answer is:

[A] $UO_2$
