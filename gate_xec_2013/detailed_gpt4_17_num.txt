To find the length of the specimen at the yield point, we need to first determine the strain at the yield point. 

Strain (ε) is defined as the change in length (ΔL) divided by the original length (L₀) of the specimen:

ε = ΔL / L₀

Step 1: Calculate the cross-sectional area of the specimen

The cross-sectional area (A) of the specimen can be calculated using the formula for the area of a circle:

A = π * (D / 2)²
where:
D = Diameter of the specimen
π = 3.14159 (Pi)

A = 3.14159 * (10 mm / 2)²
A = 3.14159 * (5 mm)²
A = 3.14159 * 25 mm²
A = 78.54 mm²

Step 2: Determine the stress at the yield point

According to the tensile test results, the material exhibits linear work hardening. This means that stress and strain are linearly related. The point at which the material starts to yield, or become plastic, can be determined from the tensile stress-strain curve (which is not provided). We'll call this stress value the Yield Stress, σ_y.

Without the specific values from the tensile test, we can't determine the exact numerical value for σ_y; however, we can continue the process assuming σ_y is known.

Step 3: Determine the strain at the yield point

Since stress (σ) and strain (ε) are linearly related, we can determine the strain at the yield point using the following equation:

ε_y = σ_y / E
where:
ε_y = Strain at the yield point
σ_y = Yield stress
E = Young's modulus of the material (which is a constant that can be found in material property tables)

Again, since we don't have the specific values for σ_y and E, we can't calculate the exact numerical value for ε_y, but we can continue with the process assuming ε_y is known.

Step 4: Determine the change in length at the yield point

Now that we have the strain at the yield point (ε_y), we can find the change in length (ΔL_y) using the original length of the specimen:

ΔL_y = ε_y * L₀
where:
ΔL_y = Change in length at the yield point
L₀ = Original length = 50 mm

Step 5: Determine the length of the specimen at the yield point

The final step is to add the change in length at the yield point (ΔL_y) to the original length (L₀) to determine the length of the specimen at the yield point (L_y):

L_y = L₀ + ΔL_y

If we had the specific values for σ_y and E, we could calculate the exact length of the specimen at the yield point; however, we can only provide the process for calculating L_y since we don't have those specific values.

The answer will be in the form:

L_y = L₀ + ΔL_y = L₀ + (ε_y * L₀)

Since we don't have specific values for the Young's modulus and yield stress, we can't provide the numerical value for L_y. However, the process outlined above provides a detailed step-by-step explanation on how to find the length of the specimen at the yield point for a material with linear work hardening behavior. ]),
