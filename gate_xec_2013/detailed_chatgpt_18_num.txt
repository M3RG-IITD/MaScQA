To find the toughness of the material, we need to find the area under the stress-strain curve up to the point of fracture. This area represents the work done on the material before it fails, and it is a measure of the material's ability to absorb energy.

First, we need to find the stress and strain values at the point of fracture. From the graph, we can see that the fracture occurs at a strain of approximately 0.15. At this point, the stress is approximately 400 MPa.

Next, we need to find the area under the stress-strain curve up to the point of fracture. We can do this by dividing the stress-strain curve into a series of rectangles and triangles, and then summing their areas.

First, we divide the curve into two regions: the straight portion with a slope of 400 MPa/0.05 = 8000 MPa, and the curved portion with an average slope of (850 MPa - 400 MPa)/(0.15 - 0.05) = 4500 MPa.

The area of the rectangle in the straight portion is:

A1 = 400 MPa * 0.05 = 20 MPa*m

The area of the triangle in the curved portion is:

A2 = 1/2 * (0.15 - 0.05) * (400 MPa + 850 MPa) = 52.5 MPa*m

The total area under the curve up to the point of fracture is:

A = A1 + A2 = 20 MPa*m + 52.5 MPa*m = 72.5 MPa*m

Finally, we convert this value to MJ/m^3 by dividing by the material's volume. Since we don't know the material's specific volume, we can't calculate the toughness in absolute terms. However, we can compare the toughness of this material to that of other materials with known volumes.

Therefore, the answer is:

- Toughness of the material = 72.5 MPa*m
