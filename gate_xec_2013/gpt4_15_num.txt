To find the minimum wavelength emitted by the LED, we can use the following equation:

E = hc / λ

where E is the energy of the emitted photons (in eV), h is the Planck's constant (4.135 x 10^-15 eV·s), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and λ is the wavelength (in meters).

First, we need to convert the energy from electron volts (eV) to joules (J) using the conversion factor of 1 eV = 1.602 x 10^-19 J:

E (J) = 1.43 eV · (1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV) = 2.289 x 10^-19 J

Now, we can rearrange the formula and solve for the wavelength:

λ = hc / E

λ = (4.135 x 10^-15 eV·s * 3 x 10^8 m/s) / (2.289 x 10^-19 J)
λ = (1.2405 x 10^-6 m) / (2.289 x 10^-19 J)

λ = 5.42 x 10^-7 m

To convert the wavelength to micrometers (μm), we'll multiply by 10^6:

λ = 5.42 x 10^-7 m * 10^6 μm/m = 0.542 μm

So the minimum wavelength of the radiation emitted by this LED is 0.542 μm.
