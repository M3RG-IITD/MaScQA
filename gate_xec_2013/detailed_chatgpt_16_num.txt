The length of the brass rod at 20°C is 50 cm. When the temperature of the rod is raised to 70°C, it will expand by a certain amount. Let us calculate that amount first.

The coefficient of linear thermal expansion of brass is given as 20 × 10⁻⁶ °C⁻¹. This means that for every degree Celsius increase in temperature, the length of the rod will increase by (20 × 10⁻⁶) × 50 = 0.001 cm (or 10 µm).

Therefore, the change in length of the rod when its temperature increases from 20°C to 70°C is (70 − 20) × 0.001 = 0.05 cm.

Now, this change in length will cause the rod to move away from its base, and the lever will move down accordingly until it breaks the circuit of the water heater. Let us calculate the distance that the lever needs to move down to break the circuit.

We can use the Pythagorean theorem to calculate this distance. Let h be the height of the lever, and d be the distance between the base of the rod and the lever when the circuit is closed.

Then, we have:

h² + d² = (d + 0.05)²

Expanding the right-hand side, we get:

h² + d² = d² + 0.1d + 0.0025

Subtracting d² from both sides, we get:

h² = 0.1d + 0.0025

Now, we need to solve for d when h = 50 mm (i.e., the length of the brass rod). Substituting this into the equation above, we get:

(50)² = 0.1d + 0.0025

Simplifying, we get:

2500 = 0.1d + 0.0025

Subtracting 0.0025 from both sides, we get:

2499.9975 = 0.1d

Dividing by 0.1, we get:

d ≈ 24999.975 ≈ 25,000 mm

Therefore, the distance x that needs to be set between the base of the rod and the lever is:

x = d − 50 ≈ 24,950 mm

Answer: [24,950 mm]
