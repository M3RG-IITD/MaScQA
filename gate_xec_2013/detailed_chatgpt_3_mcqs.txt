The Gibbs phase rule states that:

    F = C - P + 2

where
    F = degrees of freedom
    C = number of components
    P = number of phases

Rearranging the equation:

    P + F = C + 2

Substituting the given values in this equation:

    P + F = C + 2 (at constant atmospheric pressure)

Therefore, the answer is (B) P+F=C+2.
