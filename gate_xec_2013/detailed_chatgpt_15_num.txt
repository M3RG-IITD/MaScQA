First, we need to find the energy of the photon that will be emitted by the LED. We can use the formula:

E = hc/λ

Where E is the energy of the photon, h is Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 J*s), c is the speed of light (3.00 x 10^8 m/s), and λ is the wavelength of the radiation emitted.

We can rearrange this formula to solve for λ:

λ = hc/E

We know that the band gap energy of the semiconductor is 1.43 eV, but we need to convert this to joules in order to use the formula. We can use the conversion factor:

1 eV = 1.602 x 10^-19 J

So, the band gap energy is:

E = 1.43 eV × 1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV
E = 2.29 x 10^-19 J

Now we can plug in the values we know into our rearranged formula:

λ = hc/E
λ = (6.626 x 10^-34 J*s) × (3.00 x 10^8 m/s) / (2.29 x 10^-19 J)
λ = 8.65 x 10^-7 m

However, the question asks for the answer in micrometers (μm), so we need to convert meters to micrometers by multiplying by 10^6:

λ = 8.65 x 10^-7 m × 10^6 μm/m
λ = 865 nm

Therefore, the minimum wavelength of the radiation emitted by this LED is 865 nm.

Answer: 
- 865 nm
