When we talk about conventional ceramic materials and their respective applications, we should know some basics about each of the ceramics. In this question we need to match the following ceramics with their common applications. 

Column I: 
P. Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT), 
Q. Zinc Oxide (ZnO), 
R. Silicon Carbide (SiC), 
S. Zirconia (ZrO2)

Column II: 
1. cutting tool, 
2. thermal barrier coating, 
3. actuator, 
4. varistor, 
5. superconductor 

Let us now discuss each of the ceramicsâ€™ applications :

P. Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT) is widely used as an actuator because of its piezoelectric property. 

Q. Zinc Oxide (ZnO) is primarily used as a varistor. 

R. Silicon Carbide (SiC) is a type of ceramic that is best suited for use as a cutting tool.

S. Zirconia (ZrO2) is used as a thermal barrier coating and also found in superconductors. 

Now, let us match the ceramics with their respective applications: 

P-3, Q-4, R-1, S-2 

Hence, the correct answer is option (D) P-3, Q-4, R-1, S-2.
