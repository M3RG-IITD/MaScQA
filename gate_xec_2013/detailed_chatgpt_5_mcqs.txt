In metal crystals, dislocations move by the mechanism of slip. Slip occurs in specific crystallographic planes and directions called slip planes and slip directions. These planes and directions, together known as slip systems, are specific to each crystal structure.

For metals with FCC (face-centered cubic) crystal structure, each of the {111} planes can act as a slip plane, and each [110] direction within those planes can act as a slip direction. This gives a total of 12 possible slip systems.

To arrive at this answer, we can use the following steps:

1. In FCC crystals, the {111} planes are the most densely packed planes, and they are oriented at 45-degree angles to each other.

2. Within each {111} plane, there are three possible slip directions along the [110] axes, corresponding to the three possible 60-degree rotations of the plane around its normal.

3. Therefore, there are a total of 12 possible slip systems in FCC crystals.

The correct answer is (D) 12.
