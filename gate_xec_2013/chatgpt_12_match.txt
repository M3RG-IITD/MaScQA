(B) P-3, Q-4, R-5, S-2

- P: Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) - Principle of operation: detection of secondary electrons.
- Q: Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) - Principle of operation: diffraction of electrons.
- R: Scanning Tunnelling Microscope (STM) - Principle of operation: van der Waals forces between atoms.
- S: Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) - Principle of operation: electrons to jump across a potential barrier.
