The fluorite structure is a type of crystal structure in which anions are arranged in a face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice and cations occupy all the tetrahedral sites. In this structure, the coordination number of the cations is 8 (i.e. each cation is surrounded by 8 anions). 

To determine which one of the given compounds crystallizes in the fluorite structure, we need to look at the cation and anion sizes and charges. Compounds with cations having a coordination number of 8 and anions with a smaller size as compared to the cation tend to crystallize in the fluorite structure.

(A) $UO_2$: Uranium dioxide has an fcc crystal structure with oxygen ions forming a fcc lattice and uranium ions occupying half of the tetrahedral sites. Therefore, $UO_2$ does not crystallize in the fluorite structure.

(B) MgO: Magnesium oxide has a rock salt structure in which magnesium ions occupy all the octahedral sites and oxide ions occupy all the tetrahedral sites. Therefore, MgO does not crystallize in the fluorite structure.

(C) $BaTiO_3$: Barium titanate has a perovskite crystal structure in which the titanium ion occupies the center of a cube formed by the oxygen ions, and the barium ion is located at the center of the eight cubes. Therefore, $BaTiO_3$ does not crystallize in the fluorite structure.

(D) $MgAl_2O_4$: Magnesium aluminate spinel has a spinel crystal structure in which magnesium ions occupy half of the octahedral sites and the aluminum ions occupy all the tetrahedral sites. Therefore, $MgAl_2O_4$ does not crystallize in the fluorite structure.


Therefore, the correct answer is none of the given compounds crystallizes into the fluorite structure.
