Let's break down the problem and solve it step by step.

Step 1: Calculate the expansion of the brass rod at 70°C
We have initial rod length L = 50 cm, initial temperature $T_1$ = 20°C, final temperature $T_2$ = 70°C, and the coefficient of linear thermal expansion $\alpha$ = 20 x $10^{-6}$ °$C^{-1}$.

First, we need to find the change in temperature:
$\Delta T = T_2 - T_1 = 70 - 20 = 50°C$

Next, we can calculate the change in the length of the rod:
$\Delta L = \alpha \times L \times \Delta T = 20 \times 10^{-6} \times 50 \times 50 = 0.05cm$

So the expanded rod length at 70°C, $L2 = L + \Delta L = 50 + 0.05 = 50.05cm$

Step 2: Calculate the height of the triangle formed by the rod, the lever, and the distance x.
To find the height, we can use the Pythagorean theorem since we are dealing with a right-angled triangle. Let's denote the height as h.

The base of the triangle will be x (which we need to find) and the hypotenuse will be $L2 = 50.05cm$.

$h^2 + x^2 = 50.05^2$

Step 3: Find the height in terms of x
When the rod is initially at 20°C and not touching the lever, it is 50 cm long.
We also have a right-angled triangle in this case with the base being x (the same distance as before) and the hypotenuse being L = 50cm.

$h^2 + x^2 = 50^2$

Step 4: Subtract the two equations
subtracting the equation in step 3 from the equation in step 2:

$50.05^2 - 50^2 = h^2 + x^2 - (h^2) - x^2$

$(50.05^2 - 50^2) = 2x\Delta x$
where $\Delta x$ is the change in the length x resulting from rod expansion.

Step 5: Calculate x
Now, we know the expansion of the rod: $\Delta L = 0.05cm$. Since the rod is making a right angle with x, the expansion in length x will be the same: $\Delta x = 0.05cm$.

Plug in the values to above equation:

$(50.05^2 - 50^2) = 2x(0.05)$

Solve for x:

$x = \frac{(50.05^2 - 50^2)}{2(0.05)}$

$x = \frac{2500.5025 - 2500}{0.1}$

$x = \frac{0.5025}{0.1}$

$x = 5.025cm$

Since the problem asks for x in mm:

$x = 5.025 \times 10 = 50.25mm$

Answer: The distance x should be set at 50.25mm for the circuit to break at 70°C.
