The correct answer is (B) Cr or Chromium.

Here's an explanation why:

Iron and steel are prone to corrosion, and one way to improve their resistance to corrosion is by alloying them with other metallic elements. One common alloying element used in this context is chromium (Cr). When added to iron, chromium enhances the material's resistance to corrosion through a process called passivation, wherein a thin layer of chromium oxide forms on the surface of the alloy, protecting it from further corrosion.

Cobalt (Co) is also used as an alloying metal, but it is generally not used to improve corrosion resistance. Instead, it is used to increase the strength of the alloy at high temperatures or to improve its magnetic properties.

Titanium (Ti) is used as an alloying element in various applications, but it is not commonly used to improve the corrosion resistance of iron or steel. Instead, it is often used to enhance the strength-to-weight ratio of the alloy or to improve its resistance to high temperatures.

Niobium (Nb) is used as an alloying element in certain steels to improve their strength and ductility, but it is not commonly used to improve corrosion resistance.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Cr (Chromium).
