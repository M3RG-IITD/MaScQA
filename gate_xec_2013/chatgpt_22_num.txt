We can use the time-temperature superposition principle to calculate the stress at 60 days. This principle states that the response of a material at any given time and temperature can be predicted by shifting the response of the material at a known time-temperature to the desired time-temperature. We can use the shift factor α to shift the time-temperature behavior of the material. The shift factor can be calculated as:

α = 10^((T2-T1)/10)

where T1 is the initial temperature, T2 is the new temperature, and α is the shift factor.

Given:

Stress at 10 MPa, strain at 50%,
After 40 days, Stessed decreased to 5 MPa.

Now,

Using the given strain value, we can find the Young's modulus of the material as:

E = σ/ε = 10/0.5 = 20 MPa

To calculate the shift factor for the given temperature change:

α = 10^((T2-T1)/10)
α = 10^((20-20)/10) = 1

Using the time-temperature superposition principle, we can shift the stress relaxation behavior of the material at 20°C and 40 days to 60 days at 20°C:

σ(60) = σ(40) * (α)^((t1-t2)/β)

where β is the shift rate, which is the temperature sensitivity of the material and is usually taken as the reciprocal of the activation energy for the process. Here we assume β=1, which is valid for short-term predictions.

σ(60) = 5 * 1^((40-60)/1) = 5 MPa

Therefore, the stress at 60 days will be 5 MPa.

Answer: 

- 5 MPa
