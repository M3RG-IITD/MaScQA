The relationship between the number of phases (P), the number of components (C), and the degree of freedom (F) in a system at equilibrium is described by the Gibbs Phase Rule. The equation for the Gibbs Phase Rule is:

P + F = C + 2 - Φ

where Φ is the number of non-compositional variables (such as pressure, temperature, etc.) that can be changed independently without altering the system's phase equilibrium. When the problem states that the atmospheric pressure is constant, it means that pressure is not a variable that can be changed independently since it remains the same throughout the system. Consequently, Φ = 1 in this scenario.

We are given that the atmospheric pressure is constant, so we can rewrite the equation as:

P + F = C + 2 - 1
P + F = C + 1

Now we can see that the correct answer is (C) P + F = C + 1.

Answer: [(C) P + F = C + 1]
