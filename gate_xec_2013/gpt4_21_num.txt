To find the relaxation time constant for the elastomer, we can use the following equation related to stress relaxation:

σ(t) = σ₀ * e^(-t/τ)

where σ(t) is the stress at time t, σ₀ is the initial stress, t is the time duration, and τ is the relaxation time constant.

After 40 days at 20°C, the stress decreases to 5 MPa, which is half of the initial stress, 10 MPa. Since we know the initial stress (σ₀), the stress after 40 days (σ(40)), and the time duration (40 days), we can solve for the relaxation time constant (τ):

5 MPa = 10 MPa * e^(-40/τ)

First, divide both sides by 10 MPa:

0.5 = e^(-40/τ)

Next, take the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(0.5) = -40/τ

Now, solve the equation for the relaxation time constant τ:

τ = -40/ln(0.5)
τ ≈ 57.29 days

So, the relaxation time constant for this elastomer material is about 57.29 days.

Answer: [57.29]
