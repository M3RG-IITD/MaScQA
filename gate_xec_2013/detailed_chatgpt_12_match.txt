P. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) works by detecting the secondary electrons emitted from a sample when it is bombarded with an electron beam. This principle of operation matches with 4. detection of secondary electrons.

Q. Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) works by passing electrons through a sample and observing their diffraction to generate an image. This principle of operation matches with 3. diffraction of electrons.

R. Scanning Tunnelling Microscope (STM) works by measuring the current that flows between a probe tip and the sample surface due to the tunneling of electrons across a potential barrier. This principle of operation matches with 2. electrons to jump across a potential barrier.

S. Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) works by measuring the van der Waals forces between a sharp probe tip and the sample surface. This principle of operation matches with 1. van der Waals forces between atoms.

Therefore, the correct match between the microscopes listed in Column I and their principle of operation listed in Column II is:

(C) P-4, Q-3, R-2, S-1
