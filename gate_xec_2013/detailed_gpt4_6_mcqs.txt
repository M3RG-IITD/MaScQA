Recrystallization is a process that occurs in cold-worked metals wherein the deformed grains get replaced by a new set of undeformed, strain-free grains. The main goal of recrystallization is to alleviate internal stresses, reduce the dislocations, and improve the ductility and toughness of the metal. We can analyze the given options in context with recrystallization to find the correct answer:

A) Strength increases and ductility decreases:
This option is incorrect because, during recrystallization, strain-free grains form that have reduced dislocations. This reduces the overall strength of the metal, and ductility generally increases, as the metal can now deform more without breaking.

B) Strength decreases but ductility increases:
This option is correct. As explained earlier, the internal stresses are relieved, and the dislocation density is reduced during recrystallization. This typically results in a decrease in the metal's strength (as the dislocations contribute to the strength) and an increase in ductility (as the metal can deform/deform more before breaking).

C) Both strength and ductility increase:
This option is incorrect, as recrystallization generally leads to a decrease in strength, not an increase.

D) Both strength and ductility decrease:
This option is incorrect, as recrystallization increases the ductility of the metal and does not generally decrease it.

Based on the analysis of the given options, the correct answer is:
