To calculate the wavelength of the X-ray, we will use Bragg's Law equation:

nλ = 2dsinθ

Where:
- n is the order of diffraction (we will assume n=1 for the first order)
- λ is the wavelength we want to calculate
- d is the interplanar spacing in the crystal lattice
- θ is the Bragg angle (half of the 2θ angle)

First, we need to determine the interplanar spacing d for the {200} peak in the FCC lattice. For an FCC lattice, the general form for interplanar spacing d is given by:

1/d^2 = (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)/(a^2)

Where:
- h, k, and l are the Miller indices for the set of planes
- a is the lattice parameter 

For the {200} peak, h=2, k=0, and l=0, so:

1/d^2 = (2^2 + 0^2 + 0^2)/(0.352^2)
1/d^2 = 4 / (0.352^2)
d^2 = 1 / (4 / (0.352^2))
d^2 ≈ 0.123904
d ≈ 0.352 nm

Now we can use Bragg's Law equation to calculate the wavelength of the X-ray:

1λ = 2(0.352)sin(61.08/2)

Note that we need to convert the 2θ angle to radians for the sine function:

2θ = 61.08° 
θ = 61.08° / 2 = 30.54°
θ (in radians) = 30.54 * (π / 180) ≈ 0.533 radians

Now, substituting the values back into Bragg's Law equation:

λ = 2(0.352)sin(0.533)
λ ≈ 0.374 nm

So, the wavelength of the X-ray is approximately 0.374 nm.

Answer: [0.374]
