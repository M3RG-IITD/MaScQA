Firstly, let's use the abbreviation E for elastomer.  The relaxation time constant is defined by:

tau = eta / G

where eta is the viscosity and G is the shear modulus. We can relate viscosity and shear modulus to the relaxation modulus E(t) as follows:

G = E(t) / (2 * (1 + nu))

eta = E(t) / (2 * (1 + nu) * lambda)

where nu is the Poisson's ratio and lambda is the relaxation time constant. 

From the given information, we know that the initial stress is 10 MPa and the resulting strain is 50%, so the initial Young's modulus is:

E(0) = stress / strain = 10 MPa / 0.5 = 20 MPa

Now, we need to determine the relaxation modulus E(t) at 20°C, which we can obtain from the time-temperature superposition principle using the given relaxation time constant. Let's assume a reference temperature of 25°C and a shift factor of 2.5, then we have:

lambda_ref = 1 sec
T_ref = 25°C
T = 20°C
beta = 2.5

lambda = lambda_ref * exp(beta * (T - T_ref) / 10) = 1 sec * exp(2.5 * (-5) / 10) = 0.223 sec

Now, we can calculate the relaxation modulus at time t as:

E(t) = E(0) * exp(-t / lambda)

We need to find t such that the stress decreases from 10 MPa to 5 MPa, i.e., a decrease in stress of 50%. From the relaxation modulus equation above, we have:

stress = E(t) * strain = E(0) * exp(-t / lambda) * strain

Hence, the stress ratio at time t is:

stress / stress_0 = exp(-t / lambda)

Substituting in the given values, we have:

0.5 = exp(-t / lambda)

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get:

ln(0.5) = -t / lambda

Solving for lambda, we have:

lambda = -t / ln(0.5)

Since we want to find the relaxation time constant at 20°C, we'll use the relaxation time constant found at this temperature. Let's assume that t is in days, then we have:

lambda_20 = t / ln(2) = 40 / ln(2) = 57.3 days

Therefore, the relaxation time constant for this material at 20°C is 57.3 days.

Answer: 

The relaxation time constant for this material is 57.3 days.
