To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of viscoelasticity, which states that the response of a material to a constant load depends on the duration of the load application. In other words, the material will deform over time, even if the load remains constant.

Here are the key steps to solve the problem:

1. Use the stress-strain curve of the elastomer to determine its instantaneous modulus of elasticity at a strain of 50%. 

This can be done by drawing a tangent line to the stress-strain curve at the point where the strain is 50%. The slope of the tangent line represents the instantaneous modulus of elasticity. Let's assume that the instantaneous modulus of elasticity is 5 MPa.

2. Use the creep equation to determine the amount of stress relaxation that occurs after 40 days.

The creep equation is given by:
ε = σt / E
where ε is the strain, σ is the stress, t is the time, and E is the modulus of elasticity. Rearranging the equation, we get:

σ = ε × E / t

Let's assume that the strain remains constant at 50% during the 40 days. Then, we can plug in the values and solve for σ:

σ = 0.5 × 5 MPa / (40 days × 24 hours/day × 3600 seconds/hour)
σ ≈ 0.001 N/mm^2 = 1 MPa

This means that the stress decreases from 10 MPa to 1 MPa after 40 days.

3. Use the stress-strain curve again to determine the new modulus of elasticity at a strain of 50%.

With a stress of 1 MPa, the elastomer is still experiencing some deformation. We can use the stress-strain curve again to determine its new instantaneous modulus of elasticity. Let's assume that it is 2 MPa.

4. Use the creep equation again to determine the stress at 60 days.

We can assume that the strain remains constant at 50% during the additional 20 days. Then, we can plug in the new values and solve for σ:

σ = 0.5 × 2 MPa / (20 days × 24 hours/day × 3600 seconds/hour)
σ ≈ 0.0003 N/mm^2 = 0.3 MPa

Therefore, the stress after 60 days will be approximately 0.3 MPa.

Answer: [0.3 MPa]
