Vulcanization is a process in which rubber is treated with sulfur (or other chemicals) to form cross-links between the polymer chains, resulting in improved properties such as strength, elasticity, and resistance to wear and aging.

Here's a step by step explanation of the process:

1. Raw rubber, which has a highly disordered and sticky structure, is first mixed with additives and fillers (e.g., carbon black, silica, etc.) to provide the desired properties and color to the material.

2. The rubber mixture is then heated and mixed with sulfur or other vulcanizing agents. This chemical reaction forms cross-links between the individual polymer chains, creating a more connected and stable structure.

3. The vulcanization process usually takes place under heat and pressure, during which the rubber material is shaped into the desired form (e.g., tire, gasket, etc.). This can be achieved through various methods, such as molding, extrusion, or calendar processes.

4. After the vulcanization process is complete, the rubber material is cooled and finished, resulting in a more durable, elastic, and strong rubber product which is better suited for its intended application.

Since vulcanization is related to the strengthening of rubber, the correct answer is:

Answer: (A) strengthening of rubber.
