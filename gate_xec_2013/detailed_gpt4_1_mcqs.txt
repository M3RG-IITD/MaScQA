To answer this question, first we need to understand the concept of diffusivity and how it is related to temperature. 

Diffusivity (D) is a measure of how easily atoms or molecules can move through a material. It is an important property in various processes such as heat transfer, mass transfer, as well as momentum transfer. In general, diffusivity increases with temperature.

The relationship between diffusivity and temperature can be explained based on the Arrhenius equation:

D = D0 * exp(-Q/RT)

Where:
- D is the diffusivity
- D0 is the pre-exponential factor (a constant)
- Q is the activation energy for diffusion (energy required for atoms to move)
- R is the gas constant
- T is the absolute temperature in Kelvin

From this equation, we can see that diffusivity (D) increases with increasing temperature (T), provided that all other factors remain constant. The reason behind this is that the activation energy (Q) represents the energy barrier that atoms need to overcome for diffusion to happen. As temperature increases, the thermal energy of atoms also increases, allowing them to overcome the energy barrier more easily and thus move faster within the material.

However, it must be noted that the rate of increase of diffusivity with temperature does depend on the specific material, as different materials have different activation energies (Q) and pre-exponential factors (D0). Nevertheless, in general, the diffusivity will increase with temperature.

In conclusion, the correct answer is (A) the diffusivity of an atom in a solid material increases with temperature. Although the rate at which diffusivity increases depends on the specific material, this fact usually holds true for most materials.
