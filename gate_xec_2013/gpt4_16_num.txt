To find the distance x, let's first find the expansion of the brass rod when the temperature rises from 20°C to 70°C. The change in temperature, ΔT = 70 - 20 = 50°C. The length of the brass rod, L = 50 cm = 500 mm.

The formula for linear expansion is:

ΔL = L * α * ΔT

Where ΔL is the change in length, L is the original length, α is the coefficient of linear thermal expansion, and ΔT is the change in temperature.

ΔL = (500 mm) * (20 * 10^(-6) °C^(-1)) * (50°C)

ΔL = (500 mm) * (20 * 10^(-6) °C^(-1)) * (50)
ΔL = (500 mm) * (10^(-6)) * (1000)
ΔL = 0.5 mm

So the brass rod expands by 0.5 mm when heated from 20°C to 70°C.

Since the rod touches the lever when the circuit is broken, we need to adjust the distance x accordingly. Thus, x = 0.5 mm.

The distance x to be set at a water temperature of 20°C such that the circuit is broken at 70°C is [0.5 mm].
