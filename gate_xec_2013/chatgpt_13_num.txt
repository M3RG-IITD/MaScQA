We can use Bragg's Law to solve this problem:
nλ = 2dsinθ

where n is the order of diffraction (1 in this case), λ is the wavelength of the X-ray, d is the spacing between the crystal lattice planes (we need to calculate this using the lattice parameter), and θ is the angle of diffraction.

For an FCC crystal, the spacing between {hkl} planes is given by:
d = a/√(h^2+k^2+l^2)

where a is the lattice parameter, and h, k, and l are the Miller indices of the plane. For the {200} plane in this problem, h=2, k=0, and l=0.

Substituting these values, we get:
d = a/√(2^2+0^2+0^2) = a/2

Substituting the given values of θ and d into Bragg's Law, we have:
λ = 2dsinθ/n = 2(a/2)sin(61.08°) = 0.289 nm

Therefore, the wavelength of the X-ray used is 0.289 nm.

Answer: [0.289]
