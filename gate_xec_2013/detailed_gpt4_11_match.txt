To find the correct match, let's understand each of the terminologies in Column I and their relations in Column II:

P. Domain wall: A domain wall is a region that separates magnetic domains in ferromagnetic materials. Therefore, the relation is with ferromagnetic materials.

Q. Fick's law: Fick's law describes the diffusion of particles (atoms, ions) through a medium. So, the relation is with diffusion.

R. Matthiessen's rule: It is a rule that states the total resistivity of a metal is the sum of its temperature-dependent and impurity-dependent resistivity components. This leads us to the resistivity of impure metals relation.

S. Hall-Petch relation: This relation describes the strengthening of materials when the size of their particles (grains) is reduced. It relates the yield stress in a material with the grain size, and therefore the relation is with mechanical properties.

T. Meissner effect: The Meissner effect is a phenomenon in which a superconductor expels an applied magnetic field from its interior when cooled below its critical temperature. Hence, the relation is with superconductors.

Now, matching the terminologies with their relations, we get:

P-3, Q-5, R-4, S-2, T-1

So, the correct option is:

(C) P-3, Q- 5, R-4, S-2, T-1

Answer: [3, 5, 4, 2, 1]
