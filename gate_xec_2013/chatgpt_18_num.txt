The toughness of a material can be determined by calculating the area under the stress-strain curve from 0 to the fracture point. In this case, since the material exhibits linear work hardening, the stress-strain curve is a straight line.

The equation for the stress-strain curve of a material that exhibits linear work hardening is:

$σ = Kε + σ_y$

where:
- σ is the stress
- ε is the strain
- K is the work hardening coefficient (slope of the stress-strain curve)
- σ_y is the yield stress

From the given stress-strain curve, we can see that the yield stress is 240 MPa and the fracture stress is 600 MPa. The strain at fracture can be calculated as follows:

ε_f = (σ_f - σ_y) / K
     = (600 - 240) / 0.004
     = 90000

Therefore, the toughness of the material can be calculated as follows:

Toughness = Area under stress-strain curve from 0 to fracture point
         = (1/2) × (ε_f × σ_f)
         = (1/2) × (90000 × 600) × 10^(-6)  # converting MPa to N/m^2
         = 27 MJ/m^3

Answer: The toughness of the material is 27 MJ/m^3.
