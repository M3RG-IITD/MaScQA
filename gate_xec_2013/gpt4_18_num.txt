Unfortunately, there is no figure or values provided in the question. In order to calculate the toughness of the material, we would need information such as the yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, and the strain at fracture. 

Please provide the necessary information or data, and we'd be happy to help you find the toughness of the material.
