Vulcanization is the process of strengthening natural and synthetic rubber by adding sulphur and heating it. The process helps to crosslink the polymer chains, providing greater strength, elasticity, durability, and resistance to temperature changes, abrasion, and chemicals. It also reduces the stickiness and tackiness of the rubber. Therefore, the correct option is (A) strengthening of rubber.

Extrusion, injection moulding, and addition polymerisation are different processes used in the production and processing of plastics and polymers. Extrusion involves squeezing or forcing molten plastic or polymer through a die to give it a desired shape and size, such as tubes, sheets, or filaments. Injection moulding involves injecting molten plastic or polymer into a mould cavity under high pressure, where it solidifies and takes the shape of the cavity. Addition polymerisation is a chemical process in which monomers are joined together to form a long-chain polymer without the elimination of any byproduct.
