In a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure, the atoms are arranged such that the unit cell is composed of lattice points at each corner and one at the center of each face. A slip system is a combination of a slip plane and a slip direction, which allows atoms to move or "slip" along the plane in that specific direction. The slip plane is the plane along which there is the highest atomic density, and the slip direction is the direction in which the atoms have the closest-packed arrangement.

For an FCC crystal structure, the slip plane is the {111} plane, and the slip direction is the <110> direction. To find the number of slip systems, we must first find the number of unique {111} planes and then find the number of unique <110> directions in each plane.

1. Finding the number of unique {111} planes:
In an FCC structure, there are four unique {111} type planes which are (111), (1̅11), (11̅1), and (111̅), where "1̅" represents a negative value. 

2. Finding the number of unique <110> directions for each plane:
For each {111} plane, there are three unique <110> type directions. We can take the (111) plane as an example: its three unique slip directions are [110], [101], and [011]. The other three {111}planes will have their slip directions on their respective planes as well.

Now, we can find the number of slip systems by multiplying the number of slip planes by the number of slip directions per plane:

Number of slip systems = Number of {111} planes × Number of <110> directions per plane
                                     = 4 × 3
                                     = 12

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 12.
