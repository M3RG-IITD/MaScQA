The first step is to find the liquidus and solidus lines that correspond to the given alloy system. From the figure below, we can see that the liquidus line intersects with the composition at around 1340째C and the solidus line intersects with the composition at around 1250째C. Since the temperature given in the problem is 1300째C, we know that the system is completely liquid.

Next, we need to find the composition of the solid phase at this temperature. Since the system is completely liquid, we can simply use the lever rule to find the weight percentage of A in the solid phase.

The lever rule states that:

```
Weight fraction of A in solid phase = (C - L) / (S - L)
```

where C is the composition of the alloy, L is the composition of the liquid phase, and S is the composition of the solid phase.

Using the values from the problem and the phase diagram, we can plug in the numbers:

```
Weight fraction of A in solid phase = (0.47 - 0.43) / (0.68 - 0.43)
                                  = 0.04 / 0.25
                                  = 0.16
```

Therefore, the weight percentage of A in the solid phase at 1300째C is 16%.

Answer: 
- 16%
