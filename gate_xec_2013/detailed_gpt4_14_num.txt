To determine the volume of a hexagonal close-packed (HCP) unit cell, we first need to understand the geometry of the unit cell. An HCP unit cell consists of 3 layers of atoms, with the top and bottom layers being hexagonal and the middle layer sitting in the gaps between the hexagons.

The lattice constants, a and c, represent the length of a side of the hexagon (a) and the height (c) of the unit cell (between the top and bottom layers).

To find the volume, we first need to determine the area of the base (the hexagon) and then multiply this area by the height (c) of the unit cell.

1. Determine the area of the hexagon base:

The area of a regular hexagon can be found using the formula:

Area = (3*√3*a^2)/2

where "a" is the length of a side of the hexagon.

For this problem, a = 0.30 nm.

Area = (3*√3*(0.30 nm)^2)/2

2. Compute the volume of the unit cell:

To find the volume of the hexagonal close-packed unit cell, we can multiply the area of the hexagon base by the height (c) of the unit cell:

Volume = Area * c

In this problem, c = 0.56 nm.

Volume = (Area) * (0.56 nm)

3. Calculate the area and volume:

Now, let's plug in the values and calculate the area and volume:

Area = (3*√3*(0.30 nm)^2)/2 ≈ 0.235 nm^2

Volume = (0.235 nm^2) * (0.56 nm) ≈ 0.1316 nm^3

So, the volume of the unit cell of this metal is approximately 0.1316 nm^3.

The correct answer is [0.1316].
