For automatic control of household electric water heater a relay switch is activated by thermal expansion of a brass rod of length 50 cm as shown in the schematic below. The distance between the rod and the lever, x, is adjusted by moving the base of the rod. As the water gets heated the rod expands and as soon as the rod touches the lever, the circuit is broken disconnecting the heater from the power supply. Find the distance, x, in mm, to be set at water temperature of 20°C such that the circuit is broken at 70°C. The coefficient of linear thermal expansion of brass is 20 * $10^(-6)$ °$C^(-1)$
