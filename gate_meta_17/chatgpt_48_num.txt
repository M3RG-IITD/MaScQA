Given data:

σ(maximum) = 200 MPa
σ(minimum) = 0
a(initial) = 1 mm = 0.001 m
da/dN = $10^{-12}$ $(ΔK)^3$

Let's find ΔK first.
ΔK = K(maximum) - K(minimum)
K(maximum) = σ(maximum)√(πa)
           = 200 √(π × 0.001)
           = 2.513 MPa.m^(1/2)

K(minimum) = σ(minimum)√(πa)
             = 0
             = 0 MPa.m^(1/2)

ΔK = K(maximum) - K(minimum)
     = 2.513 - 0
     = 2.513 MPa.m^(1/2)

Now we can use the given formula to find out the crack length after one million cycles.

a = (∫(a(initial) to a(final)) d(a))/(∫(0 to 1,000,000)) da/dN dN ΔK^3

On solving the equation, we get:

a(final) = 0.422 m (approx)

Therefore, the length of the crack (in m) after one million cycles will be 0.422 m (approx). 

Answer: [0.422]
