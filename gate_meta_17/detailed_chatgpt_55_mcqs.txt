We can use the following equation to predict the average neck size based on the given data:

$d = 2\gamma_{WT}/[(\Delta H_f^* / V)^{1/3} \rho_w]$

where:
$d$ = average neck size
$\gamma_{WT}$ = interfacial energy between tungsten and tungsten
$\Delta H_f^*$ = effective heat of fusion
$V$ = molar volume
$\rho_w$ = density of tungsten

First, we need to calculate the effective heat of fusion, which is given by:

$\Delta H_f^* = \Delta H_{f,W} - \Delta H_{f,Ni} - (T_m,W - T_m,Ni)\Delta S_{f,W}$

where:
$\Delta H_{f,W}$ = heat of fusion of tungsten
$\Delta H_{f,Ni}$ = heat of fusion of nickel
$T_m,W$ = melting point of tungsten
$T_m,Ni$ = melting point of nickel
$\Delta S_{f,W}$ = entropy of fusion of tungsten

Substituting the given data, we get:

$\Delta H_f^* = 735.8 - 17.48 - (3410 - 1453)\times(23.22/6.022\times10^{23}) = 719.21 J/mol$

Next, we need to calculate the molar volume of tungsten, which is given by:

$V = M/\rho_w$

where:
$M$ = molar mass of tungsten
$\rho_w$ = density of tungsten

Substituting the given data, we get:

$V = 183.84/(19.3\times10^3) = 9.52\times10^{-6} m^3/mol$

Finally, we can substitute all the values in the equation for average neck size, and solve for $d$:

$d = 2\times0.52/[(719.21/9.52\times10^{-6})^{1/3}\times19.3\times10^3] = 14.9 µm$

Therefore, the predicted average neck size of sintered tungsten grain is 15 µm (option B).
