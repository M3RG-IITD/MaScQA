The balanced chemical equation for the precipitation of $Fe(OH)_3$ is:

$Fe^{3+} + 3OH^- \rightarrow Fe(OH)_3$

The solubility product expression for $Fe(OH)_3$ is:

$K_{sp} = [Fe^{3+}][OH^-]^3$

At pH below the pK$_a$ of water (which is about 15.7 at 25°C), the concentration of hydroxide ions is low and can be neglected. Therefore, we can assume that all the hydroxide ions come from the dissociation of water:

$K_w = [H^+][OH^-]$

Since $K_w = 10^{-14}$ at 25°C, we can calculate the concentration of hydroxide ions at pH 14 (the highest pH):

$10^{-14} = [H^+][OH^-]$

$[OH^-] = 10^{-14}/[H^+]$

$[OH^-] = 10^{-14}/10^{-14} \times 10^{-14}$

$[OH^-] = 10^{-28}$

At pH 14, the concentration of hydroxide ions is $10^{-28}$ M, which is much lower than the $10^{-3}$ M concentration of $Fe^{3+}$ in the solution. Therefore, at pH 14, $Fe(OH)_3$ will not precipitate.

To find the minimum pH at which $Fe^{3+}$ will precipitate as $Fe(OH)_3$, we can use the solubility product expression and substitute the concentration of $Fe^{3+}$ and $[OH^-]$ with $K_{sp}$ and $10^{-14}/[H^+]$, respectively:

$K_{sp} = [Fe^{3+}][OH^-]^3$

$K_{sp} = 10^{-39} = [Fe^{3+}](10^{-14}/[H^+])^3$

$[Fe^{3+}] = 10^{-39} \times ([H^+]^{-3}) \times 10^{42}$

$[Fe^{3+}] = 10^{3pH - 39}$

At the minimum pH for precipitation, the concentration of $Fe^{3+}$ will be equal to the solubility product divided by the cube of the concentration of hydroxide ions. Since the concentration of hydroxide ions is proportional to the inverse of the concentration of hydrogen ions, we can simplify the equation to:

$[Fe^{3+}] = K_{sp}/[H^+]^3$

$10^{3pH - 39} = 10^{-3}/[H^+]^3$

$[H^+]^3 = 10^{42-3pH-3}$

$[H^+] = 10^{14-pH-1}$

$pH = 14 - log([H^+])$

$pH = 14 - log(10^{14-pH-1})$

$pH = 14 - (14-pH-1)$

$pH = 1.00$

Therefore, the minimum pH at which $Fe^{3+}$ will precipitate as $Fe(OH)_3$ is 1.00.
