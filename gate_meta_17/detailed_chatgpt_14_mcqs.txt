At low temperatures, crystalline metals undergo plastic deformation through a limited number of mechanisms. Of the given options, the primary mechanisms of accommodating plastic strain at low temperatures in crystalline metals are:

(A) Twinning and dislocation-slip

Twinning involves the formation of a new mirror-image crystal lattice structure across a predetermined plane within a crystal. Twinning can occur in response to stress and allows for a high degree of plastic deformation with low energy absorption. This mechanism is commonly observed in hexagonal close-packed metals.

Dislocation-slip involves the movement of dislocations (defects in the crystal lattice) through the crystal lattice. At low temperatures, dislocation-slip is the dominant mechanism of plastic deformation in metallic crystals. Dislocation-slip can occur through multiple crystal planes, and the movement of dislocations can lead to slip bands and the formation of new grain boundaries.

Therefore, the correct option is (A) twinning and dislocation-slip.
