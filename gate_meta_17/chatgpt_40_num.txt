The formula to calculate specific energy consumption is:

Specific Energy Consumption = (Voltage x Current x 3600) / (Atomic Weight x Cathodic Current Efficiency)

Plugging in the values:

Specific Energy Consumption = (3.5 x 400 x 3600) / (65 x 0.9)
Specific Energy Consumption = 356000 / 58.33
Specific Energy Consumption = 6106.90 kJ/kg (rounded to two decimal places)

Answer: [6106.90]
