First, we need to calculate the stress concentration factor (K) using the length of the crack and the geometry of the material. For a surface crack in an infinite solid, K = 2. Therefore, K = 2.

Next, we can use the formula for the fracture strength of a brittle material with a surface crack: 

sigma_f = sqrt((2*E*surface_energy)/pi*a)

where E is the Young's modulus, surface_energy is the surface energy, and a is the length of the crack.

Substituting the given values, we get:

sigma_f = sqrt((2*60*10^9*0.5)/(pi*2*10^(-6))) = 896.28 MPa

Therefore, the fracture strength of this material is 896.28 MPa.

Answer: [896.28]
