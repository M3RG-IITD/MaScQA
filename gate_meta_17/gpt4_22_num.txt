In the wire drawing process, we can relate the true strain (ε) to the die angle of the wire drawing die (α) and the reduction in area 'r' (ratio of initial area to final area) as:

ε = ln(r) = ln(A0/A1)

Where A0 is the initial area and A1 is the final area after the wire drawing process.

The material shows power law behavior as given by:

σ = 50 * ε^0.3

For the annealed condition, the maximum strain (ε_max) occurs when the drawing stress (σ) is equal to the flow stress (σf) of the material.

Let's assume σf = 50*ε_max^0.3

We know that the drawing stress (σ) is given by:

σ = σf * (1 - η * sin^2(α/2))

For ideal work and efficiency η = 1, the equation becomes:

σf = 50*ε_max^0.3 = σf * (1 - sin^2(α/2))

Since σf is constant and non-zero, we can divide both sides by σf:

1 = (1 - sin^2(α/2)) / ε_max^0.3

Now, we can solve for ε_max:

ε_max^0.3 = 1 - sin^2(α/2)

Raise both sides to the power of 1/0.3 to find ε_max:

ε_max = (1 - sin^2(α/2))^(1/0.3)

As we are not given any information regarding the die angle (α), we cannot calculate the exact maximum strain (ε_max) value for the given annealed condition in wire drawing. However, we have found the relationship between ε_max and die angle α in the form of:

ε_max = (1 - sin^2(α/2))^(1/0.3)

In general, by knowing the die angle α or flow stress σf of the material, one can determine the maximum strain per pass in annealed condition for the given wire drawing process.
