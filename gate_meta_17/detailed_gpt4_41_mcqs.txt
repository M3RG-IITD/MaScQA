To determine the correct answer, we first need to understand what it means for two solutions to be in chemical equilibrium. Chemical equilibrium occurs when the rate of the forward reaction is equal to the rate of the reverse reaction, and the concentrations of the reactants and products remain constant.

Now, let's analyze the given options:

(A) Mole fraction of A in α = mole fraction of A in β and mole fraction of B in α = mole fraction of B in β

This condition suggests that the compositions of both phases are the same, which is not the criterion for chemical equilibrium. Equilibrium doesn't imply equal compositions of species in both phases, but rather that there is no net change in their compositions.

(B) Mole fraction of B in α = mole fraction of A in β and mole fraction of A in α = mole fraction of B in β

This condition also doesn't represent chemical equilibrium; it implies that the mole fractions of A and B are simply interchanged between the two phases, which is not necessary for equilibrium.

(C) Activity of A in α = activity of A in β and activity of B in α = activity of B in β

This condition represents chemical equilibrium well because it states that the activity of each species (A and B) in both phases (α and β) is the same. Activity can be thought of as an "effective concentration" that factors in the interactions between the species in the solution. When the activities of A and B in both phases are equal, there will be no net transfer of A or B between the phases, and thus the system will be in equilibrium.

(D) Activity of A in α = activity of B in β and activity of B in α = activity of A in β

This condition does not represent chemical equilibrium, as there is no reason for the activities of A in one phase to be equal to the activities of B in the other phase.

So, the correct answer is:

[Option (C) Activity of A in α = activity of A in β and activity of B in α = activity of B in β]
