We can start by using Bragg's law, which relates the angle of diffraction (θ) to the wavelength of the X-ray radiation, the lattice spacing (d) and the order of the diffraction peak (n):

$2d\sinθ = nλ$

For an FCC metal, the (111) planes have the highest atomic density and therefore produce the second diffraction peak. The spacing between the (111) planes in a FCC lattice can be calculated using the lattice parameter (a) as:

$d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{3}}$

Substituting the given values and solving for θ:

$d = \frac{0.36\text{ nm}}{\sqrt{3}} = 0.2082\text{ nm}$

$λ = 0.154\text{ nm}$

$n = 2$

$2d\sinθ = nλ$

$2(0.2082\text{ nm})\sinθ = 2(0.154\text{ nm})$

$\sinθ = \frac{0.154\text{ nm}}{0.4164\text{ nm}} = 0.3703$

$\theta = \sin^{-1}(0.3703) = 22.09^\circ$

Therefore, the second peak in the powder X-ray diffraction pattern of this FCC metal occurs at a Bragg angle of 22.09 degrees.
