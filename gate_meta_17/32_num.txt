Given: (i) Ambient temperature = 298K, (ii) emissivity of steel = 0.8, (iii) convective heat transfer coefficient = 4.6 $W.m^(-2).K^(-1), (iv) Stefan- Boltzmann constant(Ïƒ) = 5.7 * $10^(-8)W.m^(-2).k^(-4)$. A continuous cast steel slab, 1m * 1m * 0.1m, at 1298 K cools in air. The initial rate of heat loss (in KW) from the top surface of slab by radiation and convection is?(answer up to two decimal places)
