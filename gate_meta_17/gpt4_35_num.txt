To find the degree of freedom F, we can use the Gibbs' phase rule:

F = C - P + 2

Where C is the number of components (independent chemical species) and P is the number of phases.

In this case, we have 3 components: CaCO3, CaO, and CO2. There are 2 solid phases (CaCO3 and CaO) and 1 gas phase (CO2), so there are 3 phases in total.

Using the Gibbs' phase rule:

F = 3 - 3 + 2

F = 2

So, the degree of freedom F is 2.

The correct answer is [2].
