The solubility product expression for $Fe(OH)_3$ is:
$$K_{sp}=[Fe^{+3}][OH^-]^3$$

Let's first calculate the concentration of hydroxide ions in the solution. Since $K_{sp}$ is extremely small, we can assume that the amount of $Fe^{+3}$ precipitated is negligible compared to the initial concentration, so we can assume that $[Fe^{+3}]$ remains unchanged. Thus, we can rearrange the solubility product expression to solve for $[OH^-]$:
$$[OH^-]=\sqrt[3]{\frac{K_{sp}}{[Fe^{+3}]}}=\sqrt[3]{\frac{10^{-39}}{10^{-3}}}=10^{-12}$$

The minimum pH at which $Fe^{+3}$ will precipitate as $Fe(OH)_3$ corresponds to the pH at which the concentration of hydroxide ions is equal to the concentration of $Fe^{+3}$. At this pH, the reaction quotient, Q, is equal to $K_{sp}$, and precipitation will occur. We can use the following equation to relate pH to $[OH^-]$:
$$pH=-\log_{10}[H^+]$$

Since $[H^+][OH^-]=10^{-14}$ at 25Â°C, we can rearrange the above equation to solve for $[H^+]$ in terms of $[OH^-]$:
$$[H^+]=\frac{10^{-14}}{[OH^-]}=\frac{10^{-14}}{10^{-12}}=10^{-2}$$

Therefore, the minimum pH at which $Fe^{+3}$ will precipitate as $Fe(OH)_3$ is:
$$pH=-\log_{10}[H^+]=-\log_{10}(10^{-2})=\boxed{2}$$

Final answer: 2
