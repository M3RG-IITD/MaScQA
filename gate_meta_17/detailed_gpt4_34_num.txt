To solve this problem, we first need to separate the variables in the differential equation dC/dt = -(c-c*), where c and c* are the instantaneous and equilibrium concentration of carbon in steel, respectively.

Step 1: Separate the variables
dC/(c-c*) = -dt

Step 2: Integrate both sides
∫(1/(c-c*)) dC = -∫ dt

Let's call the integration constant "A". After integrating, we get:

ln|c-c*| = -t + A

Step 3: Solve for c
c-c* = e^(-t + A)
c = c* + e^(-t + A)

Now, we have two known values: c* = 0.04 wt.% and c(t=0) = 0.4 wt.%. We can now plug these values into the equation we derived above and solve for the integration constant "A".

c(t=0) = 0.4 wt.% = 0.04 wt.% + e^(-0 + A)
0.36 = e^A
A = ln(0.36)

Now we have the value for the integration constant A. We can now plug it back into the original equation to find the concentration of carbon in the steel at t=1 min.

c(t=1) = c* + e^(-t + ln(0.36))
c(t=1) = 0.04 + e^(-1 + ln(0.36))

c(t=1) ≈ 0.227 wt.% (up to three decimal places)

So, the concentration of carbon in steel (in wt.%) at t = 1 min is approximately 0.227 wt.%.

Answer: [0.227]
