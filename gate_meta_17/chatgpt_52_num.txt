First, we need to find the strain corresponding to the yield strength. Using the formula for Young's modulus:

stress = E * strain

We can rearrange to solve for strain:

strain = stress / E

Using the given values:

strain_yield = 450 MPa / 4.5 GPa = 0.1

Now we can calculate the resilience, which is the strain energy stored per unit volume up to the yield strength. This can be found using the formula:

resilience = (1/2) * stress_yield * strain_yield

resilience = (1/2) * 450 MPa * 0.1 = 22.5 J/m^3

Next we need to find the toughness, which is the energy per unit volume required to fracture the material. This can be found using the area under the stress-strain curve up to the fracture strain. Since the material is perfectly elastic-plastic, the stress-strain curve is a straight line up to the yield stress, and then continues horizontally to the fracture strain. The area can be divided into two rectangles:

toughness = (1/2) * stress_yield * strain_yield + stress_yield * (strain_fracture - strain_yield)

toughness = (1/2) * 450 MPa * 0.1 + 450 MPa * (0.45 - 0.1) = 148.5 J/m^3

Finally, we can calculate the ratio of resilience to toughness:

resilience/toughness = 22.5 J/m^3 / 148.5 J/m^3 = 0.151

Answer: [0.151]
