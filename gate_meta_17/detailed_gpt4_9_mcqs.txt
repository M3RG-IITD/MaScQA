To find the correct order of precipitation sequence for Al-4.5 wt.% Cu alloy during ageing, we need to understand the phase transformation process and microstructural evolution occurring in this alloy.

The Al-4.5 wt.% Cu alloy undergoes a process known as precipitation hardening or ageing. Precipitation hardening is a heat treatment technique used to increase the strength of materials by forming particles of a hard secondary phase dispersed within the softer matrix phase.

The ageing process of Al-Cu precipitation hardened alloy involves the following steps:

1. Solution treatment at a high temperature (at which the alloy is completely in the single-phase solid solution state) to dissolve the copper solute into aluminum matrix.
2. Rapid quenching (usually by water or oil) to retain the metastable supersaturated solid solution at room temperature.
3. Ageing treatment at an elevated temperature to promote the controlled precipitation of the specific sequences and transform the metastable supersaturated solid solution into stable equilibrium phases.

Now let's analyze the available information in the question to find the correct precipitation sequence for Al-4.5 wt.% Cu alloy during ageing.

The Al-4.5 wt.% Cu alloy undergoes the following precipitation sequence:

1. GP zones: Guinier-Preston zones or GP zones are small clusters of copper atoms that form in the early stages of precipitation hardening. They are coherent with the aluminum matrix, meaning they have the same crystal structure and orientation, which leads to minimal lattice strain.

2. θ': The theta prime phase (θ') is a metastable intermediate precipitate formed during precipitation hardening in Al-Cu alloys. It is an ordered phase coherent with the aluminum matrix and has a higher volume fraction of copper compared to GP zones, leading to increased strengthening.

3. θ'': The theta double prime phase (θ'') is another metastable intermediate stage in the precipitation sequence, with even more copper atoms than the theta prime (θ') precipitate. The θ'' phase grows by the dissolution of the GP zones and its coherency with the aluminum matrix contributes to the strengthening of the alloy.

4. θ: The theta phase (θ) is the stable equilibrium precipitate that forms at the later stages of ageing in the Al-4.5 wt.% Cu alloy. It has a lower strengthening effect than the metastable phases due to the loss of coherency with the aluminum matrix.

Therefore, the correct precipitation sequence for Al-4.5 wt.% Cu alloy during ageing to reach stable equilibrium is:

GP zone → θ' → θ'' → θ

Hence the correct answer is: [A]
