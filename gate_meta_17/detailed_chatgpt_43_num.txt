The formula for the critical radius of a nucleus is given by:

$r* = \frac{2γv_m}{ΔG_v}$

where $v_m$ is the molar volume of the solid phase.

Since we are given the critical edge length of a cube-shaped nucleus, we can use the formula:

$r* = \frac{3aγ}{ΔG_v}$

where a is the edge length of the cube.

To find the critical edge length, we need to solve for a:

$a = \frac{r* ΔG_v}{3γ}$

We are given the surface energy γ = 0.177 J/m² and the change in volume free energy $ΔG_v$ = -2.8 * 10⁸ J/m³. To find the molar volume of the solid phase, we can assume that the metal is a close-packed crystalline structure, such as FCC or BCC. For FCC metals, the molar volume is given by:

$v_{m,FCC} = \frac{4}{3}(\frac{a}{\sqrt{2}})^3$

For BCC metals, the molar volume is given by:

$v_{m,BCC} = \frac{4}{3}(\frac{a}{\sqrt{3}})^3$

We don't know which metal we're dealing with, so let's assume that it's FCC. Then we have:

$v_{m,FCC} = \frac{4}{3}(\frac{a}{\sqrt{2}})^3$

$v_{m,FCC} = \frac{4}{3}(\frac{r*ΔG_v}{3γ\sqrt{2}})^3$

At the critical radius, $r*$, the free energy change for the formation of a nucleus is given by:

$ΔG* = \frac{4}{3}πr^3γ - 4πr^2ΔG_v$

Setting this equal to zero and solving for $r*$ gives:

$r* = \frac{2γv_m}{ΔG_v}$

$r* = \frac{2γv_{m,FCC}}{ΔG_v}$

$r* = \frac{2(0.177)(\frac{4}{3})(\frac{a}{\sqrt{2}})^3}{-2.8×10^8}$

$r* = 4.077a^3×10^{-7}$

Substituting this expression for $r*$ into the expression for $a$ gives:

$a = \frac{r* ΔG_v}{3γ}$

$a = \frac{(4.077a^3×10^{-7})(-2.8×10^8)}{3(0.177)}$

$a = -12.103×10^{-9}a^3$

Solving for $a$ gives:

$a = 2.13×10^{-9} m = 2.13 nm$

Therefore, the critical edge length of a cube-shaped nucleus is 2.13 nm.
