To solve this question, we should first understand what crystallographic systems and minimum symmetry (also referred to as point group symmetry) represent. 

Crystallographic systems are a method of classifying crystal structures based on the underlying symmetry of their lattice. There are seven crystallographic systems: triclinic, monoclinic, orthorhombic, tetragonal, trigonal, hexagonal, and cubic.

Minimum symmetry (point group symmetry) is the set of symmetry operations that leave at least one point in a structure unchanged. In the case of crystal structures, these usually involve rotational axes, reflection planes, and inversion centers.

Now, let's analyze the crystallographic systems from Group I and find their corresponding minimum symmetry in Group II.

(P) Tetragonal:
The tetragonal system is known for its characteristic four-fold rotation axis. Therefore, it corresponds to a minimum symmetry of 1 four-fold rotation (Group-II, option 4).

(Q) Cubic:
The cubic system has three mutually perpendicular four-fold rotation axes. It also has four three-fold rotation axes along the body diagonals of the cube. The minimum symmetry for cubic crystal structures is 4 three-fold rotations (Group-II, option 3).

(R) Monoclinic:
In the monoclinic system, there is only a single two-fold rotation axis. This corresponds to a minimum symmetry of 1 two-fold rotation (Group-II, option 1).

(S) Rhombohedral:
The rhombohedral (trigonal) system features one three-fold rotation axis as its minimum symmetry element. Therefore, it corresponds to a minimum symmetry of 1 three-fold rotation (Group-II, option 2).

Now that we know the corresponding minimum symmetries for each crystallographic system, let's find the correct combination in the offered options:

(A) P-3; Q-4; R-2; S-3
(B) P-4; Q-3; R-2; S-1
(C) P-1; Q-2; R-4; S-3
(D) P-4; Q-3; R-1; S-2

The correct match is (D) P-4; Q-3; R-1; S-2.

Answer: [(D) P-4; Q-3; R-1; S-2]
