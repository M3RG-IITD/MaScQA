First, we need to determine the theoretical density of the tungsten powder compact. The theoretical density is calculated as:

Theoretical density = Atomic weight of tungsten / Atomic volume of tungsten

The atomic weight of tungsten is 183.84 g/mol, and its atomic volume can be determined using its crystal structure which is body-centered cubic (BCC), as:

Atomic volume = (V_molecule * Z) / N_A

where V_molecule is the volume of the tungsten molecule, Z is the number of atoms per unit cell (in BCC, Z = 2), N_A is Avogadro's number (6.022 × 10^23 mol^-1).

The volume of a tungsten molecule can be calculated using its density, which is 19.3 g/cm^3:

Density = mass / volume

Volume of a tungsten molecule = mass / density

Mass of a tungsten molecule = Atomic weight / N_A

Substituting the values, we get:

Volume of a tungsten molecule = Atomic weight / (density * N_A) = 9.59 × 10^-23 cm^3

Now, we can calculate the atomic volume:

Atomic volume = (V_molecule * Z) / N_A = (9.59 × 10^-23 cm^3 * 2) / 6.022 × 10^23 mol^-1 = 3.19 × 10^-23 cm^3/mol

Substituting this value in the equation for theoretical density, we get:

Theoretical density = 183.84 g/mol / 3.19 × 10^-23 cm^3/mol = 19.32 g/cm^3

Next, we need to determine the final density of the sintered compact. The final density is given as 86.5% of the theoretical density:

Final density = 86.5% * theoretical density = 0.865 * 19.32 g/cm^3 = 16.7118 g/cm^3

We can now use the definition of density to calculate the final dimensions of the tungsten compact, assuming uniform shrinkage:

Density = Mass / Volume

We can write the initial volume of the compact as V and the linear dimensions as L. The initial mass is then:

Mass = 0.55 * Theoretical density * V = 0.55 * 19.32 g/cm^3 * V

After sintering, the final mass can be calculated using the final density:

Mass = Final density * V = 16.7118 g/cm^3 * V

Since the mass is conserved, we can equate the above two equations to find V:

0.55 * 19.32 g/cm^3 * V = 16.7118 g/cm^3 * V

V = 0.9108 * V

Therefore, the linear dimensions (L') after sintering are:

L' = L * (V' / V)^(1/3) = L * (0.9108 / 1)^(1/3) = L * 0.96897

The linear shrinkage is then:

Linear shrinkage = (L - L') / L * 100% = (L - L * 0.96897) / L * 100% = 3.10%

Therefore, the linear shrinkage is 3.10%.
