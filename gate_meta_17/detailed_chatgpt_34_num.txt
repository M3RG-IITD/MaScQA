The given differential equation is: 

dC/dt = -(c - c*)

We can rearrange this equation as: 

dC/(c - c*) = -dt 

Now we can integrate both sides: 

∫dC/(c - c*) = -∫dt 

ln|c - c*| = -t + K 

where K is the constant of integration. 

We can solve for K using the initial condition that c(0) = 0.4%: 

ln|0.4 - 0.04| = -0 + K 

K = ln(0.36) 

So the equation becomes: 

ln|c - 0.04| = -t + ln(0.36) 

We can exponentiate both sides: 

|c - 0.04| = e^(-t+ln(0.36)) 

|c - 0.04| = e^(ln(0.36)/e^t) 

Now we can split the equation into two cases: 

1. c - 0.04 = e^(ln(0.36)/e^t) 

c = 0.04 + e^(ln(0.36)/e^t) 

2. c - 0.04 = -e^(ln(0.36)/e^t) 

c = 0.04 - e^(ln(0.36)/e^t) 

We can simplify the second case as follows: 

c = 0.04 - e^(ln(0.36)/e^t) 

c = 0.04 - 0.36^(1/e^t) 

Now we need to determine which case is valid for the given initial condition. 

At t = 0, both cases reduce to: 

c = 0.04 + e^ln(0.36) = 0.4 

So both cases are valid. 

Now we can use either case to find the concentration of carbon at t = 1. 

Using case 1: 

c = 0.04 + e^(ln(0.36)/e) 

c ≈ 0.060 

Using case 2: 

c = 0.04 - e^(ln(0.36)/e) 

c ≈ 0.002 

Therefore, the concentration of carbon in steel at t= 1 min is approximately 0.060 wt.%. 

Answer: 
- 0.060 (wt.%)
