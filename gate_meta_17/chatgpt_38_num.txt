The balanced chemical equation for the combustion of CO with oxygen is:

$2CO + O_2 \rightarrow 2CO_2$

The stoichiometric ratio of CO to O2 is 2:1.

Given the molar flow rate of CO as $1 kg-mol.h^{-1}$, the molar flow rate of O2 would be half of that, i.e. $0.5 kg-mol.h^{-1}$.

Since the reaction is assumed to be adiabatic, there is no heat exchange with the surroundings. Therefore, the enthalpy change of the reactants is equal to the enthalpy change of the products.

Let's calculate the standard enthalpy change of the reactants and products:

$ΔH°_{reactants} = ΔH°(CO) + ΔH°(0_2) = 0 + 0 = 0$

$ΔH°_{products} = ΔH°(2CO_2) = 2 * (-282000 kJ.(kg-molCO)^{-1}) = -564000 kJ.(kg-mol)^{-1}$

The enthalpy change of the reaction is given by:

$ΔH°_{reaction} = ΔH°_{products} - ΔH°_{reactants} = -564000 kJ.(kg-mol)^{-1}$

Now, we can use the following energy balance equation to calculate the adiabatic flame temperature:

$Σn_iC_pΔT = -ΔH°_{reaction}$

where $n_i$ is the number of moles of each species, $C_p$ is the heat capacity at constant pressure, and $\Delta T$ is the change in temperature.

Since the reaction goes to completion, the number of moles of CO decreases by 2 for every 1 mole of O2 consumed. Therefore, the number of moles of CO in the products is zero and the number of moles of CO2 is twice the number of moles of O2 consumed.

Let $T_1$ be the initial temperature of the reactants (25°C = 298 K) and $T_2$ be the adiabatic flame temperature.

Substituting the values, we get:

$(1 kg-mol * 44 kJ.(kg-mol K)^{-1} * (T_2 - 298 K)) + (0.5 kg-mol * 0 kJ.(kg-mol K)^{-1} * (T_2 - 298 K)) = -(-564000 kJ.(kg-mol)^{-1})$

Simplifying, we get:

$44T_2 - 13172 = 564000$

$44T_2 = 577172$

$T_2 ≈ 13135.27 K ≈ 13135 K$ (rounded to 2 decimal places)

Therefore, the adiabatic flame temperature is approximately 13135 K.

Answer: [13135 K]
