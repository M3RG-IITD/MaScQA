We can use Bragg's Law to solve this problem:

$n\lambda = 2d\sin\theta$

where $n$ is the order of the peak (in this case, $n = 2$), $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the X-rays, $d$ is the interplanar spacing, and $\theta$ is the Bragg angle.

To find $d$ for an FCC crystal, we can use the formula:

$d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2}}$

where $a$ is the lattice parameter, and $h$, $k$, and $l$ are the Miller indices for the plane of interest. For the second peak in an FCC powder pattern, the Miller indices are (1,1,0).

So, we can plug in the given values:

$n = 2$

$\lambda = 0.154~\text{nm}$

$a = 0.36~\text{nm}$

$h = 1$

$k = 1$

$l = 0$

$d = \frac{0.36}{\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 0^2}} = 0.180~\text{nm}$

Now, we can rearrange Bragg's Law to solve for $\theta$:

$\theta = \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{n\lambda}{2d}\right)$

Plugging in the values we've found:

$\theta = \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{2(0.154~\text{nm})}{2(0.180~\text{nm})}\right) = 32.63^\circ$

So the answer is:

- 32.63
