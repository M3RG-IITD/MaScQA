We can use the Avrami equation to determine the transformation percentage after a certain time.

The Avrami equation is given by:
Y = 1 - exp(-k*t^n)

where:
Y = percentage of transformation
k = rate constant
t = time
n = Avrami exponent (given as 2)

We know that after 100s, the transformation is 20% complete, so we can plug these values into the equation to solve for k:

0.20 = 1 - exp(-k * 100^2)

Now we need to find the value of k:

0.80 = exp(-k * 10000)
ln(0.80) = -k * 10000
k = -ln(0.80) / 10000 ≈ 2.288e-5

Now that we have the value of k, we can find the transformation percentage after 400s:

Y = 1 - exp(-2.288e-5 * 400^2)
Y = 1 - exp(-3.6608)
Y = 1 - 0.02573
Y ≈ 0.97427

The transformation percentage after 400s is approximately 97.43%.

So the answer is [97.43].
