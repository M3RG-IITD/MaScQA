The standard cell potential ($E_{cell}$) can be calculated as follows:

$E_{cell}$ = $E_{reduction \, potential \, of \, the \, cathode}$ - $E_{reduction \, potential \, of \, the \, anode}$

$E_{cell}$ = E°($Cu^(+2)$/Cu) - E°($Zn^(+2)$/Zn)

$E_{cell}$ = 0.337 V - (-0.763 V)

$E_{cell}$ = 1.1 V

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 1.1 V.
