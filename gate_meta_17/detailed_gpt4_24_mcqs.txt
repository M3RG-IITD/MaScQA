To answer this question, let's briefly discuss each manufacturing technique and then determine which one is used for making window glass.

A) Investment casting:
Investment casting, also known as lost-wax casting, is a precision casting process used to produce metal parts from almost any alloy. In this process, a wax pattern is coated with a ceramic material. The coated pattern is then heated and the wax is melted, leaving a hollow ceramic mold. Next, the molten metal is poured into the mold, allowed to solidify, and then the ceramic material is removed, leaving the finished part behind.

B) Patenting:
Patenting is a heat treatment process used to refine the structure and improve the ductility of steel wires. The steel is heated and then cooled quickly, typically in a lead bath, to create a fine, homogeneous structure. This process is primarily utilized in the wire and cable industry.

C) Spray forming:
Spray forming is a manufacturing process that involves the deposition of small droplets of molten metal onto a substrate. This is achieved by atomizing molten metal into fine droplets and then spraying the metal droplets onto a rotating or stationary substrate. The droplets rapidly solidify upon contact, forming a layer of solid metal. The process is typically used for forming certain alloys and advanced materials, such as aluminum and specialty steels.

D) Float-bath method:
The float-bath method, also known as the float glass process or Pilkington process, is a manufacturing technique used for producing flat sheets of glass. In this process, molten glass is poured onto a bath of molten tin, where it spreads out and forms a continuous ribbon of uniform thickness. The glass "floats" on top of the tin, which is heavier and allows the glass to smooth out naturally. The glass is then annealed, cooled slowly to reduce internal stresses, and cut into sheets.

Based on the descriptions of each manufacturing technique, we can determine that the correct answer is:
