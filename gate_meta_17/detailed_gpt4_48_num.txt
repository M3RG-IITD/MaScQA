Given:
- σ(max) = 200 MPa (maximum stress)
- σ(min) = 0 (minimum stress)
- Initial crack length (a₀) = 1 mm = 0.001 m
- da/dN = $10^{-12} (ΔK)^3$
- N = 1 million cycles

To find the length of the crack after one million cycles, we need to first find the stress intensity factor ΔK, then integrate the crack growth rate equation.

Step 1: Calculate the stress intensity factor ΔK
ΔK = Kmax - Kmin
Since the minimum stress is 0, Kmin = 0, so we only need to find Kmax.

Kmax = σ√(πa₀)
Substitute the given values:
Kmax = (200 MPa)√(π * 0.001 m)

Kmax ≈ 356.06 MPa√m

Therefore, ΔK ≈ 356.06 MPa√m.

Step 2: Integrate the crack growth rate equation
Now, we will integrate the crack growth rate equation to find the final crack length after one million cycles.

da/dN = $10^{-12} (ΔK)^3$
Integrate with respect to N:
∫(da) = $10^{-12} (ΔK)^3$ ∫dN

Integrate from 0 to N and a₀ to a:
∫(da) from a₀ to a = $10^{-12} (ΔK)^3$ * ∫dN from 0 to N

(a - a₀) = ($10^{-12} (ΔK)^3$) * N
a - 0.001 m = ($10^{-12} (356.06 MPa√m)^3$) * (10^6 cycles)
a = 0.001 m + ($10^{-12} * (356.06 MPa√m)^3$) * (10^6 cycles)

Calculate the values:
a ≈ 0.001 m + 0.002690 m
a ≈ 0.003690 m

The length of the crack after one million cycles will be approximately 0.003690 m, or 3.690 mm.
