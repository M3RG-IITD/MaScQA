Given: $ΔH°_(298)$ (CO → $CO_2$) = -282000 kJ.(kg-mol $CO)^(-1)$, $C_p(CO_2)$ = 44kJ.(kg-mol $K)^(-1)$. A stoichiometric mixture of CO and pure oxygen at 1 atm and 25°C flows into a combustion reactor. The molar flow rate of CO entering the reactor is $1kg-mol.h^(-1)$. The adiabatic flame temperature(in K) for the combustion of CO with stoichiometric oxygen is?(answer up to two decimal places)
