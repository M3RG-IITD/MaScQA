The Third law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of a perfect crystal approaches zero as its temperature approaches absolute zero. Therefore, the entropy of transformation at 0 K is zero.

To find the entropy of transformation at 368.5 K, we can use the equation:

ΔS = ΔS1 + ΔS2

where ΔS1 is the entropy change associated with heating the orthorhombic sulfur and ΔS2 is the entropy change associated with cooling the monoclinic sulfur.

ΔS = 36.86 J/K + (-37.8 J/K)
ΔS = -0.94 J/K

Therefore, the entropy of transformation at 368.5 K is -0.94 J/K.

Answer: 

-0.94 J/K
