To solve this question, let's first understand the basic concept of rolling and friction in case of a slab. When a slab is rolled, it follows the direction of the rollers. The friction between the workpiece (slab) and the rollers is crucial in determining the motion of the slab.

Let's now analyze points P and Q with respect to the workpiece.

At point P (near the entrance): When the slab is entering the rolling system, it moves in the direction of rolling. According to the rolling operation, the frictional force acts in a direction that promotes this motion (i.e., the direction of the rolling). So, at point P, the frictional force is along the rolling direction.

At point Q (near the exit): When the slab is exiting the rolling system, it again moves in the direction of rolling. The frictional force acts in a direction to counteract the motion of the slab (opposite to the direction of rolling). So, at point Q, the frictional force is opposite to the rolling direction.

So, the correct statement is: (C) Frictional force is along rolling direction at P and opposite to rolling direction at Q. 

Answer: [C]
