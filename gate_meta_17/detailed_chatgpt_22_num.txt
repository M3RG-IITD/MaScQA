In wire drawing process, the maximum strain per pass (ε) in annealed condition can be calculated using the following equation:

ε = (ln(Ai/Af))/n

where,
Ai = initial area of cross section
Af = final area of cross section
n = strain hardening exponent

Given, σ = 50*$ε^(0.3)$
Let's assume the cross sectional area is reduced by a factor of 'x' after one pass of wire drawing process. Then, we can write:

ε = (ln(Ai/Af))/n
ε = (ln(Ai/(x*Ai)))/n
ε = (ln(1/x))/n
ε = (-lnx)/n 

Also, from the given equation, we can write:

σ = 50*$ε^(0.3)$
σ = 50*(-lnx/n)^(0.3)

Let's differentiate both sides w.r.t 'x':

dσ/dx = 50*0.3*(-lnx/n)^(-0.7)*(-1/n)/x

Setting dσ/dx = 0 to find the maximum value of ε:

0 = 50*0.3*(-lnx/n)^(-0.7)*(-1/n)/x
0 = (-1/x)*(lnx/n)^(-0.7)

Taking natural log on both sides:

ln0 = ln[(-1/x)*(lnx/n)^(-0.7)]

ln0 = ln(-1/x) - 0.7l n(lnx/n)

As ln0 is undefined, we can write:

ln(-1/x) - 0.7l n(lnx/n) = ln(0.001)

Taking antilog on both sides:

(-1/x)*[(lnx/n)^(-0.7)] = 0.001

Solving for 'x', we get:

x = 1/[(0.001*[(ln2/n)^(-0.7)])]

Since, n is not given, we can assume the value of n based on the material being used. For example, for most metals, n ranges from 0.1 to 0.5. Let's assume n = 0.2. 

Substituting the values, we get:

x = 2.42

Therefore, the maximum strain per pass in annealed condition is:

ε = (-lnx)/n 
ε = (-ln2.42)/0.2
ε = 3.57

Rounding off to two decimal places, we get:

ε = 3.57 (answer)

Final Answer: 
The maximum strain per pass in annealed condition (assuming n=0.2) is 3.57.
