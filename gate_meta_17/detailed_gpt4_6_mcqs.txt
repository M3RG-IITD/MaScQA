We are given that the rate of dissolution of Al particles in liquid steel is proportional to the concentration difference (ΔC). In order to find the correct expression for ΔC, we can analyze the given expressions one by one.

(A) C* - $C_b$
In this case, ΔC is the difference between the saturation concentration of Al in liquid steel (C*) and the bulk concentration of dissolved Al in liquid steel ($C_b$). This seems to make sense because the rate of dissolution should depend on the difference between the current concentration of Al in liquid steel and the maximum concentration it can reach (saturation).

(B) $C_b$ - $C_m$
Here, ΔC is the difference between the bulk concentration of dissolved Al in liquid steel ($C_b$) and the density of Al/atomic weight of Al ($C_m$). This doesn't seem to make sense because $C_m$ is related to the density and atomic weight of Al and not the concentration of Al in liquid steel.

(C) C* - $C_m$
In this option, ΔC is the difference between the saturation concentration of Al in liquid steel (C*) and the density of Al/atomic weight of Al ($C_m$). As in option (B), the latter term does not seem to be related to the concentration of Al in liquid steel, so this doesn't make sense either.

(D) $[C*C_(m)]^(1/2)$ - $C_b$
This option has a more complex expression, but as we have noted before, $C_m$ does not seem to be related to the concentration of Al in liquid steel. Therefore, the square root term does not seem to make sense.

Based on our analysis, the correct expression for ΔC should be:

ΔC = (A) C* - $C_b$

So the correct answer is:

[A]
