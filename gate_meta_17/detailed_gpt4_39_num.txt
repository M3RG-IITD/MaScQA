To find the minimum pH at which $Fe^{+3}$ will precipitate as $Fe(OH)_3$, we need to determine the concentration of hydroxide ions ($OH^-$) in the solution at equilibrium. 

1. Write the balanced equation for the reaction:
$Fe^{+3} + 3OH^- \rightleftharpoons Fe(OH)_3$

2. Write the expression for the solubility product constant (Ksp):
$K_{sp} = [Fe^{+3}] [OH^-]^3$

Given $K_{sp} = 10^{-39}$, and $[Fe^{+3}] = 10^{-3}$ M, we can solve for $[OH^-]$:

$10^{-39} = (10^{-3}) [OH^-]^3$

3. Divide both sides by $10^{-3}$:
$10^{-36} = [OH^-]^3$

4. Take the cube root of both sides:
$(10^{-36})^{1/3} = [OH^-]$

$10^{-12} = [OH^-]$

5. Use the relationship between concentration of $H^+$ ions, $OH^-$ ions and the pH, pOH scale: 
$pOH = -\log_{10}[OH^-]$

$pOH = -\log_{10}(10^{-12})$

$pOH = 12$

6. Convert pOH to pH using the relation: 
$pH + pOH = 14$

Substitute the value of pOH:

$pH = 14 - 12$

$pH = 2$

The minimum pH at which $Fe^{+3}$ will precipitate as $Fe(OH)_3$ is 2.00.
