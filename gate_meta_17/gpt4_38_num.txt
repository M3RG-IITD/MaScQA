To find the adiabatic flame temperature, we start by writing the heat balance of the reaction :

ΔH_reaction + Σ n*C_p(T - T_ref)_products = Σ n*C_p(T - T_ref)_reactants

where ΔH_reaction is the enthalpy change of the reaction, n is the number of moles of each species, C_p is the heat capacity, T is the temperature, and T_ref is the reference temperature (298 K).

For the stoichiometric combustion of CO, the balanced chemical equation is:

CO + 1/2 O_2 → CO_2

We are given that ΔH°_(298) (CO → CO_2) = -282,000 kJ.(kg-mol CO)^(-1). Since the adiabatic flame temperature (T) is what we want to find, we can write the heat balance equation as:

ΔH_reaction + n*C_p(T - T_ref)_CO2 = 0

We have ΔH_reaction = -282,000 kJ.(kg-mol CO)^(-1), n = 1 kg-mol.h^(-1) (molar flow rate of CO), and C_p(CO_2) = 44 kJ.(kg-mol K)^(-1).

Substituting the given values, we get:

-282,000 + 1*44*(T - 298) = 0

Solve for T:

44*(T - 298) = 282,000

T - 298 = 282,000/44

T = 298 + (282,000/44)

T ≈ 298 + 6,409.09

T ≈ 6,707.09 K

The adiabatic flame temperature for the combustion of CO with stoichiometric oxygen is approximately 6,707.09 K.

Answer: [6707.09].
