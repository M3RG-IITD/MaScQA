The standard cell potential, E°cell, of the electrochemical reaction $cu^{2+}$ + Zn = $Zn^{2+}$ + Cu can be calculated using the formula:

E°cell = E°(reduction at cathode) - E°(oxidation at anode)

where the reduction half-reaction occurs at the cathode and the oxidation half-reaction occurs at the anode.

In this case, the reduction half-reaction is:

$Cu^{2+}$ + 2 e- → Cu

with E°red = 0.337 V

The oxidation half-reaction is:

Zn → $Zn^{2+}$ + 2 e-

with E°ox = -0.763 V

To use the formula, we need to reverse the oxidation half-reaction and flip its sign to get:

$Zn^{2+}$ + 2 e- → Zn   with E°red = -E°ox = 0.763 V

Now we can calculate the standard cell potential:

E°cell = E°(reduction at cathode) - E°(oxidation at anode)

E°cell = E°red(Cu2+/Cu) - E°red(Zn2+/Zn)

E°cell = 0.337 V - 0.763 V

E°cell = -0.426 V

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) -0.426V.
