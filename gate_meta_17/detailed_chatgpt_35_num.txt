In thermodynamic equilibrium, the degree(s) of freedom (F) is determined by the number of independent variables that can be changed without upsetting the equilibrium. 

In this case, we have a closed system in which $CaCO_3$(s) is dissociating into $CaO$(s) and $CO_2$(g). At equilibrium, the concentrations of the products and reactants will be constant, but the temperature and pressure can still be changed independently.

In other words, we can change either the temperature or pressure of the system without affecting the equilibrium constant. Therefore, there are two independent variables: temperature and pressure.

The degree of freedom (F) is thus 2.

Answer: 

- F = 2.
