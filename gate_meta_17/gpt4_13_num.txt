We can use the following formula to find the effective number of atoms in a unit cell of this metal:

$$\text{density} = \frac{\text{effective number of atoms}\cdot \text{atomic weight}}{\text{lattice parameter}^3\cdot N_A}$$

Where $N_A$ is Avogadro's number (approximately $6.022\times10^{23}\text{mol}^{-1}$).

We are given the density as $19000\text{ kg/m}^3$, the lattice parameter as $0.4\text{ nm}$, and the atomic weight as $183\text{ amu}$.

First, let's convert the lattice parameter from nanometers to meters:

$0.4\text{ nm} = 0.4 \times 10^{-9}\text{ m}$

Now we need to find the effective number of atoms in one unit cell. Rearrange the formula for the effective number of atoms (let's call this value $z$):

$$z = \frac{\text{density} \cdot \text{lattice parameter}^3\cdot N_A}{\text{atomic weight}}$$

Plug in the given values to solve:

$$z = \frac{19000\text{ kg/m}^3 \times (0.4\times10^{-9}\text{ m})^3 \cdot 6.022\times10^{23}\text{mol}^{-1}}{183\text{ amu}}$$

$$z \approx 3.96$$

Since the effective number of atoms is close to 4, we can assume there are 4 atoms in one unit cell of this metal. The final answer is [4].
