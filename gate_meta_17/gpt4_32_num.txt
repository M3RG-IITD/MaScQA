We need to find the initial rate of heat loss from the top surface of the slab by both radiation and convection. The areas for both heat transfer are the same which is the top surface area of the slab.

The area of the top surface of the slab, A = 1m * 1m = 1 $m^2$

The rate of heat loss due to radiation, q_rad = emissivity * σ * A * (T_slab^4 - T_ambient^4)
where T_slab = 1298 K and T_ambient = 298 K

q_rad = 0.8 * 5.7 * 10^(-8) * 1 * (1298^4 - 298^4)
q_rad ≈ 145361.14 W (approx)

The rate of heat loss due to convection, q_conv = h * A * (T_slab - T_ambient)
where h = 4.6 $W.m^(-２).K^(-1)$

q_conv = 4.6 * 1 * (1298 - 298)
q_conv = 4600 W

The total rate of heat loss, q_total = q_rad + q_conv
q_total = 145361.14 W + 4600 W
q_total ≈ 149961.14 W

Since the question asks for the answer in kW, we will convert the result:

q_total ≈ 149.96 kW

Therefore, the initial rate of heat loss from the top surface of the slab by radiation and convection is approximately 149.96 kW.

Answer: [149.96]
