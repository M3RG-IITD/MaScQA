The given parameters are:

Young's modulus, E = 4.5 GPa = 4,500 MPa

Yield strength, σ_y = 450 MPa

Fracture strain, ε_f = 0.45

We can use the formula for resilience to calculate it as follows:

Resilience (Ur) = (σ_y²) / (2E)

Substituting the given values, we get:

Ur = (450²) / (2 x 4,500) = 22.5 J/m³

Now, we need to calculate the toughness of the material. Since it is an elastic-plastic material, we can assume that the area under the stress-strain curve represents the toughness (i.e., the energy absorbed by the material before fracture).

From the given parameters, we can calculate the maximum stress that the material can withstand before fracture as follows:

σ_max = σ_y / ε_y = 450 / 0.45 = 1,000 MPa

We can plot the stress-strain curve for the given material as follows:

```
           |
           |    + (σ_max, ε_f)
     σ (MPa)    |
           |     |
           |     |
           |     |
σ_y ___.___|___.____
           |         \
           |          \
           |           \
           |            \
           |             \
           |              \
           |               \
           |                \
           |______________________________
                          ε
```

The area under the stress-strain curve can be divided into two parts: the elastic part (area OABC) and the plastic part (area BCDEO).

The total area under the stress-strain curve (i.e., toughness) can be calculated as follows:

Toughness (Ut) = (1/2) x σ_y x ε_y + σ_max x (ε_f - ε_y) - (1/2) x (σ_max - σ_y) x ε_y

Substituting the given values, we get:

Ut = (1/2) x 450 x 0.45 + 1,000 x (0.45 - 0.45) - (1/2) x (1,000 - 450) x 0.45

Ut = 101.25 J/m³

Finally, the ratio of resilience to toughness can be calculated as:

Ur / Ut = 22.5 / 101.25 = 0.222

Therefore, the ratio of resilience to toughness for this material is approximately 0.222.
