Given: Entropy change associated with heating orthorhombic sulfure from 0K to 368.5 K is 36.86 $J.K^(-1)$. Entropy change asssociated with cooling monoclinic sulfur from 368.5K to 0 K is -37.8 $J.K^(-1)$. Pure orthorhombic sulfure transforms to stable monoclinic sulfure monoclinic sulfure above 368.5K. Applying Third law of thermodynamics, the value of entropy (in $J.K^(-1)$) of transformation of 368.5 K is ?(answer up to two decimal places)
