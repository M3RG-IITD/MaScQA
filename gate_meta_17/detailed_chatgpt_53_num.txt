Chvorinov's equation states that the total solidification time is proportional to the volume of the casting divided by the surface area. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

t = C * V/A^n

where:
t = solidification time
V = volume of the casting
A = surface area of the casting
n = exponent, typically ranging from 1.5 to 2.5
C = constant of proportionality

For the cubic casting, each side has a length of 5.0 cm, so the volume and surface area are:

V_casting = 5.0 cm * 5.0 cm * 5.0 cm = 125 cm^3
A_casting = 6 * (5.0 cm * 5.0 cm) = 150 cm^2

Using the given solidification time of 1.6 min and the exponent of 2, we can solve for the constant of proportionality:

C = t * A^n / V

C = 1.6 min * (150 cm^2)^2 / 125 cm^3 = 4608 cm^4/min

Now we need to find the height of the riser that will give a solidification time of 3.2 min. We know that the ratio of diameter to height is 0.5, so we can express the height in terms of the diameter:

h = 0.5 * d

The volume and surface area of a cylinder are:

V_riser = π * (d/2)^2 * h
A_riser = 2 * π * (d/2)^2 + π * d * h

Plugging in the given values and the equation for height in terms of diameter, we get:

3.2 min = C * V_riser / A_riser^2

3.2 min = 4608 cm^4/min * [π * (d/2)^2 * 0.5d] / [(2π * (d/2)^2) + (πd * 0.5d)]^2

Solving for d, we get:

d = 1.86 cm

And using the equation for height in terms of diameter, the height of the riser is:

h = 0.5 * d = 0.93 cm

Therefore, the height of the riser is 0.93 cm.

Answer: 
- 0.93 cm
