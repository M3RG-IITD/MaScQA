$T_1$ and $T_2$ are the melting points of pure metal A and pure stoichiometric oxide $AO_2$, respectively, and $T_1$<$T_2$. The stoichiometric metal oxidation reaction A(s) + $O_2$(g) = $AO_2$(s) is in equilibrium at 1 atm pressure at temperatre less than $T_1$. If the temperature increases, which schematic in the image represents the correct standard free energy change versus temperature plot?
