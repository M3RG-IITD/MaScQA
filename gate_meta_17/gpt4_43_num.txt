We can find the critical edge length of a cube-shaped nucleus using the formula for critical nucleus size derived from the Gibbs' free energy criterion for nucleation:

$R_c=\dfrac{2*γ}{ΔG_v}$

Here, $R_c$ is the critical radius of the nucleus, $γ$ is the surface energy, and $ΔG_v$ is the change in volume free energy.

Given:
$γ=0.177 J.m^{-2}$ 
$ΔG_v=-2.8*10^8 J.m^{-3}$

Plugging in the given values, we have:
$R_c=\dfrac{2*0.177}{-2.8*10^8}=-1.26*10^{-9} m$

Since it's a cube, the critical edge length is the cube root of $R_c$. Therefore, let's denote the critical edge length as L:

$L=\sqrt[3]{R_c}$

$L=\sqrt[3]{-1.26*10^{-9}} m$
$L \approx 10^{-3} m$

Converting meters to nanometers (1 meter = 10^9 nanometers):

$L \approx 10^{-3} * 10^9 nm = 10^6 nm$

Knowing that we are looking for an answer up to two decimal places, we can say:

L = [10.00] nm
