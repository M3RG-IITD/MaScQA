As the question mentions low temperature, we can assume that the dislocations will not undergo significant thermal vibration. 

In configuration P, both dislocations have the same Burgers vector and are situated in parallel slip planes. Therefore, they will repel each other due to the elastic energy associated with the distortion of the crystal lattice. Hence, configuration P corresponds to option 3.

In configuration Q, both dislocations have opposite Burgers vectors and are located in parallel slip planes. Therefore, they will attract each other due to their opposite signs. Hence, configuration Q corresponds to option 2.

In configuration R, both dislocations have the same Burgers vector and are located in adjacent slip planes. Therefore, they will be in unstable equilibrium as they will tend to glide over each other, leading to the formation of a new slip plane. Hence, configuration R corresponds to option 4.

In configuration S, both dislocations have opposite Burgers vectors and are located in adjacent slip planes. Therefore, they will be in stable equilibrium as they will tend to cancel each other's effect due to their opposite signs. Hence, configuration S corresponds to option 1.

Matching the configurations with their corresponding options, we get:

P-3
Q-2
R-4
S-1

Therefore, the correct answer is option (A) P-3, Q-2, R-4, S-1.
