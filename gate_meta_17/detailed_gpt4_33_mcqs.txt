To solve this question, we need to first understand the Pourbaix diagram and its components. A Pourbaix diagram is a graphical representation of the equilibrium potential (E) and pH of a specific element or compound, usually in an aqueous solution, at a given temperature and pressure. It is used to understand the stability of an element or compound, understand its corrosion and passivity, and also identify the redox and precipitation/dissolution reactions that an element undergoes in different conditions.

Now let's find the Nernst equation for this reaction:

For the half-reaction,
$Al^{+3} + 3e^− → Al$; $E° = −1.662V$

Let's multiply the given reaction by 3 in order to balance the electrons with the half-reaction:

$3[Al^{+3} + 2H_2O = AlO_2^{-1} + 4H^{+1}]$

Now we can add both reactions:
$4Al^{+3} + 6H_2O + 3e^− → 3AlO_2^{-1} + 12H^{+1} + Al$

Thus, our complete reaction is:
$4Al^{+3} + 6H_2O + 3e^− = 3AlO_2^{-1} + 12H^{+1} + Al$

Now, let's apply the Nernst equation to find the equilibrium potential:

$E = E° - \frac{RT}{nF} * ln(Q)$

Here,
E° = -1.662 V (standard potential)
R = 8.314 J/mol·K (gas constant)
T = 298 K (temperature)
n = 3 (number of electrons transferred)
F = 96485 C/mol (Faraday's constant)
Q = Reaction quotient

Now, let's find the reaction quotient Q:

$Q = \frac{[AlO_2^{-1}]^3[H^{+1}]^{12}}{[Al^{+3}]^4}$

We know that pH = -log[H^{+1}], so [H^{+1}] = $10^{-pH}$.

Substituting [H^{+1}] in the equation for Q:
$Q = \frac{[AlO_2^{-1}]^3(10^{-pH})^{12}}{[Al^{+3}]^4}$

Now let's substitute the values into the Nernst equation:

$E = -1.662 - \frac{8.314 × 298}{3 × 96485} * ln(\frac{[AlO_2^{-1}]^3(10^{-pH})^{12}}{[Al^{+3}]^4})$

Simplifying,

$E = -1.662 - \frac{0.0815}{3} * (12(-pH) - ln([AlO_2^{-1}]^3) + 4ln([Al^{+3}]))$

Further simplifying,

$E = -1.662 + 0.0272(4ln([Al^{+3}]) - 12pH - ln([AlO_2^{-1}]^3))$

The Pourbaix plot will be a graph similar to the equation:
$E$ (potential) versus $pH$, with slopes of $0.0272*$ times some coefficients given the equilibrium concentrations of the ions. Unfortunately, we cannot choose between options A, B, C, or D as we do not have the reference Pourbaix plot to identify the correct plot based on the derived equation. However, this equation can be used to plot the E-pH plot for the given reaction.
