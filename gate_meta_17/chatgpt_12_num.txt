First, calculate the carbon content in austenite using the lever rule:

%Carbon in austenite = (0.35 - 0.025) / (0.8 - 0.025) = 0.426

The eutectoid reaction is:

Austenite â†’ Ferrite + Cementite

At the eutectoid composition, the product phases will have the same mass fraction. Therefore, the mass fraction of ferrite and cementite in pearlite will be 0.5 each.

Now, we can use the lever rule again to determine the fraction of austenite that transforms into pearlite:

%Pearlite = (0.426 - 0.025) / (0.8 - 0.025) = 0.553

Therefore, the mass fraction of pearlite just below the eutectoid temperature is 0.553.

Answer: [0.553]
