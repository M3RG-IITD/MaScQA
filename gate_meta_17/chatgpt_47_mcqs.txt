We use the relation $σ = neμn + peμp$, where $n$, $μ_n$, and $μ_p$ are the electron concentration, and electron and hole mobilities, respectively. Since the semiconductor is intrinsically doped, $n=p=n_i$, where $n_i$ is the intrinsic carrier concentration. At room temperature, the number of electrons excited to conduction band will be equal to the number of holes created in the valence  band( $n_i^2 = n_e n_h$(where $n_e$ and $n_h$ are the electron and hole concentrations respectively). Let's substitute the values, we get:

$10^(-6) = n_i (μ_n + μ_p) $= $n_i (μ_n + μ_n exp (- Eg/2kT))$

where $E_g$ is the energy gap of Si and $k$ is Boltzmann's constant.

Substituting the values, we get:

$n_i = \sqrt(\frac{σ}{q (μ_n + μ_n exp (-E_g/2kT))})$

$n_i = \sqrt(\frac{10^-6} {(1.6 * 10^-19)(0.75 + 0.06 exp(-1.12/(2*10^-4 * 1.38*10^-23))}))$

$n_i = 7.7 * 10^(12)$ $m^(-3)$

Therefore, the answer is (B) 7.7 * $10^(12)$.
