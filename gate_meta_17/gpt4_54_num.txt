We will be using the following formula to find the reduction in the thickness of the slab:

Reduction = Initial thickness × (1 - (1 - sin(angle of bite))^2)

where:
Reduction = Maximum possible reduction in the thickness
Initial thickness = Thickness of the slab before rolling (250mm)
Angle of bite = 10°

Converting the angle of bite to radians:
10° × (π/180) = 10 × 0.01745 = 0.174 radians

Now substituting the values in the formula:
Reduction = 250 × (1 - (1 - sin(0.174))^2)
Reduction = 250 × (1 - (1 - 0.173648))^2)
Reduction = 250 × (1 - 0.826352^2)
Reduction = 250 × (1 - 0.682977)
Reduction = 250 × 0.317023

Maximum possible reduction = 79.26mm (rounded to two decimal places)

So, the maximum possible reduction during rolling is [79.26] mm.
