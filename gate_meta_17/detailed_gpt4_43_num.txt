To solve this problem, we need to find the critical size of a cube-shaped nucleus during the homogeneous nucleation process. The critical size of a nucleus is the size at which the nucleus is in a state of equilibrium – the driving force for nucleation (i.e., the change in volume free energy, ΔGv) is balanced with the opposing force due to increase in surface energy (γ). In this situation, the total free energy change (ΔG) is at its maximum value. Note that in general, the shape of a nucleus can be any geometrical structure (like sphere, cylinder etc.), however, in this particular case, the shape provided is a cube.

To find this equilibrium, we can write the total free energy change as a sum of the volume energy change and surface energy change terms. For a cube with an edge length 'a', the volume (V) and surface area (A) are given as follows:

Volume, V = a³
Surface area, A = 6a²

Now, let's write ΔG in terms of ΔGv and γ:

ΔG = ΔGv * V - γ * A

Using the values of volume and surface area in terms of edge length 'a': 

ΔG = ΔGv * a³ - γ * (6a²)

Now to find the critical size, we need to find the value of the edge length 'a' at which ΔG is maximum. To do this, we should differentiate ΔG with respect to 'a' and set the derivative equal to zero:

d(ΔG) / d(a) = 0

Differentiating the expression for ΔG with respect to 'a' and equating to zero, we get:

(3 * ΔGv * a²) - (12 * γ * a) = 0

Now, we can factor out a common term of 3a from the equation:

a(ΔGv * a - 4 * γ) = 0

This equation has two solutions: a = 0, and a = 4γ/ΔGv. Since a = 0 does not correspond to a nucleus (as it would have zero size), the only physical solution corresponds to the second one. So, the critical edge length 'a' is given by:

a = 4γ/ΔGv

Next, substitute the given values of γ and ΔGv:

a = 4 * (0.177 J/m²) / (- 2.8 * 10⁸ J/m³)

a = - 2.54 * 10⁻⁹ m

However, we should not have a negative dimension for a physical nucleus. The negative sign in the ΔGv value represents the decrease of free energy with a volume change, so we use the absolute value of ΔGv in our calculation:

a = 4 * (0.177 J/m²) / (2.8 * 10⁸ J/m³)

a = 2.54 * 10⁻⁹ m

Convert the result to nanometers:

a = 2.54 nm

Thus, the critical edge length of a cube-shaped nucleus in a liquid of a pure metal during homogeneous nucleation is approximately 2.54 nm.
