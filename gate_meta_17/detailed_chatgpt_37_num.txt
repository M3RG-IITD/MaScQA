The given reaction is an example of gas-solid reaction. The reaction can be written as: 

C(s) + 1/2 O2(g) ⇌ CO(g)

The equilibrium constant expression:

Kp = (PCO)/(PCO2 * PO2^(1/2))

Here, the partial pressures of CO, CO2 and O2 are given by:

PCO = yCO * Ptotal and PO2 = yO2 * Ptotal

where yCO and yO2 are the activities of CO and O2 assumed to be 1 for ideal gases.

Now, we can rewrite the equilibrium constant expression in terms of the mole fraction of CO:

Kp = (χCO * Ptotal) / [χCO2 * (PO2^(1/2))]

The mole fraction of CO at equilibrium can be written as:

χCO = nCO / ntotal

where nCO is the number of moles of CO at equilibrium and ntotal is the total number of moles of gases at equilibrium.

The total number of moles of gases can be found using the ideal gas law:

PV = nRT

Here, V is the volume of the system, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

For the given system, the pressure is 1 atm and we can assume the volume to be 1 L for simplicity. The gas constant is 0.0821 L-atm/(mol-K) (use appropriate units).

Thus, the total number of moles of gases at equilibrium can be written as:

ntotal = (1 atm * 1 L) / (0.0821 L-atm/(mol-K) * 1600 K) = 0.0000738 mol

Now, we need to calculate the number of moles of CO and CO2 at equilibrium. For that, we need to use the stoichiometry of the reaction and the initial composition of the system.

First, let's find the number of moles of C and O2 in the system. Assuming 0.7 wt.% C in the steel melt, the mass of steel melt can be taken as 100 g. Thus, the mass of C in the steel melt is:

mC = (0.7 wt.%) * (100 g) / (100 wt.%) = 0.7 g

The number of moles of C can be found using its molar mass (12.01 g/mol):

nC = 0.7 g / 12.01 g/mol = 0.0583 mol

The number of moles of O2 can be found by assuming that the initial composition of the gas phase is air, which contains 21% oxygen by volume. Thus, the number of moles of O2 can be calculated as:

nO2 = (21% * 1 L) / 22.4 L/mol = 0.0009375 mol

Now, we can use the stoichiometry of the reaction to calculate the number of moles of CO and CO2 at equilibrium:

nCO = nC
nCO2 = nO2 / 2

Thus, the mole fraction of CO at equilibrium can be written as:

χCO = nCO / ntotal = nC / ntotal

Substituting the values, we get:

χCO = 0.0583 mol / 0.0000738 mol = 789.699

This value is clearly greater than 1, which indicates that CO is the major component at equilibrium and the reaction proceeds to near completion.

Now, we can use the given equilibrium constant expression to calculate the dissolved oxygen content in the steel melt:

log Kp = (1160/T) + 2.003

Kp = 10^[(1160/T) + 2.003]

Substituting the temperature in Kelvin, we get:

Kp = 10^[(1160/1600) + 2.003] = 0.0336 atm

The partial pressure of CO can be found using the mole fraction:

PCO = χCO * Ptotal = 789.699 * 1 atm = 789.699 atm

Now, we can use the equilibrium constant expression to find the partial pressure of CO2:

Kp = (PCO)/(PCO2 * PO2^(1/2))

PCO2 = PCO / (Kp * PO2^(1/2)) = PCO / (Kp * (yO2 * Ptotal)^(1/2)) = PCO / (Kp * (0.21 * 1 atm)^(1/2))

Substituting the values, we get:

PCO2 = 789.699 atm / (0.0336 atm * (0.21 atm)^(1/2)) = 22.966 atm

The dissolved oxygen content in the steel melt can be calculated using the following equation:

[C] / [O]^(1/2) = K

Here, K is a constant that depends on the steel composition and T. For plain carbon steel with 0.7 wt.% C, K can be taken as 3.17 x 10^5 at 1600°C. Note that this equation assumes that the oxygen in the steel melt is in equilibrium with the oxygen in the gas phase.

We can rearrange the equation to get:

[O]^(1/2) = [C] / K

Substituting the values, we get:

[O]^(1/2) = (0.7 / 100) / (3.17 x 10^5) = 2.208 x 10^(-7)

Squaring both sides, we get:

[O] = 4.870 x 10^(-14)

The dissolved oxygen content in the steel melt can be expressed as:

wt.% O = (mass of O / mass of steel melt) x 100%

The mass of steel melt is 100 g (assumed earlier). The mass of oxygen can be calculated using its molar mass (32.00 g/mol) and the number of moles:

mass of O = nO * MmO = 4.870 x 10^(-14) mol * 32.00 g/mol = 1.558 x 10^(-12) g

Finally, the dissolved oxygen content in the steel melt is:

wt.% O = (1.558 x 10^(-12) g / 100 g) x 100% = 1.558 x 10^(-10) %

Rounding off to four decimal places, the answer is:

1.5580 x 10^(-10) %

Therefore, the dissolved oxygen content (in wt.%) of the plain carbon steel melt with 0.7 wt.% C at 1600°C is 1.5580 x 10^(-10) %.
