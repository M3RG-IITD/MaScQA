First, we need to use the given reaction and the ideal gas law to find the number of moles of hydrogen that dissolve in one kg of Pd at 1 atm pressure and 300°C:

$H_2$ = 2[H]

From the reaction, we know that for every mole of $H_2$ that dissolves, two moles of [H] are formed. So, the number of moles of [H] in one kg of Pd is:

$1.64 * 10^4\ mm^3/kg \cdot \frac{1\ L}{1000\ mm^3} \cdot \frac{1\ mol}{22.4\ L}\cdot 2\ = 1.46\ mol/kg$

Now, we can use the ideal gas law to find the pressure of hydrogen at the new solubility:

$PV = nRT$

At 300°C, R = 0.082 L atm/(mol K), and T = 573 K. Let's assume a volume of 1 L of Pd for simplicity. At the new pressure, there will be $n_{H_2}/2$ moles of hydrogen dissolved in this volume. So:

$P(1) = \frac{n_{H_2}/2\cdot R \cdot T}{1} = \frac{1.46\cdot R\cdot 573}{2} = 220\ \text{atm}$

Now we can convert this pressure to the new volume using the ideal gas law at STP:

$P\cdot V = n\cdot RT$

$V = \frac{n\cdot RT}{P} = \frac{n_{H_2}/2\cdot R\cdot 273}{P} = \frac{1.46\cdot 0.082\cdot 273}{0.09} = 2.96\ \text{L}$

Finally, we can convert this volume to mm^3/kg using the solubility equation and rounding to one decimal place:

$V_{mm^3/kg} = 2.96\ L\cdot 1000\ mm^3/L = 2960\ mm^3/kg$

Therefore, the solubility of hydrogen in Pd at 300°C and $P_{H_2} = 0.09\ \text{atm}$ is 2960 $mm^3$/kg Pd (STP).
