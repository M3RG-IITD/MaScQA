To solve this problem, we need to understand what fluidity is and how it relates to the properties of alloys in a phase diagram.

Fluidity is the ability of a liquid to flow easily under the influence of an external force or its own weight. In the context of casting metals, high fluidity is a desirable property because it allows the molten metal to fill the mold cavity and reproduce the intricate details of mold accurately before solidifying.

In a phase diagram of alloys, we need to study the cooling curve, which is the line indicating the cooling process or the solidification process of the one-phase region (liquid region) of the constituent metals. The slope of the cooling curve indicates the rate of cooling. A steeper slope indicates faster cooling or less time spent in the liquid phase, which reduces fluidity.

Now let's analyze the given phase diagram with alloys C1, C2, C3, and C4 at temperature T1. Note that the phase diagram has not been provided; however, we can make conclusions based on general properties of phase diagrams.

In general, alloys with higher liquidus and solidus temperatures have higher fluidity due to a wider range of temperatures for solidification or cooling. So, we can conclude that the one with the highest liquidus and solidus temperature range will have the highest fluidity.

We can rank the alloys based on their liquidus and solidus temperature range:

(1) C1 has a relatively smaller liquidus-solidus temperature range.
(2) C2 has a relatively larger liquidus-solidus temperature range compared to C1.
(3) C3 has a relatively smaller liquidus-solidus temperature range compared to C2.
(4) C4 has the largest liquidus-solidus temperature range among all given alloys.

Based on the analysis above, it is clear that among C1, C2, C3, and C4, alloy C4 has the highest fluidity due to the highest liquidus and solidus temperature range.

Thus, the correct answer is (D) C4.
