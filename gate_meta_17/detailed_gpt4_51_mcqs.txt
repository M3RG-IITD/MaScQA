To determine which slip system will be activated, we need to calculate the Schmid factor for each of the given slip systems. The Schmid factor is given by:

SF = |cosθ cosλ|

where θ is the angle between the tensile stress direction and the slip plane normal, and λ is the angle between the tensile stress direction and the slip direction.

We are given that the tensile stress is applied along the [110] direction. Now, let's analyze each slip system:

(A) Slip direction: (a/2)[-1 1 0], Slip plane normal: (1 1 1)
(B) Slip direction: a/2 [0 1 1], Slip plane normal: (1 1 -1)
(C) Slip direction: a/2[0 1 1], Slip plane normal: (1 -1 1)
(D) Slip direction: a/2[1 1 0], Slip plane normal: (-1 1 -1)

Step 1: Calculate the dot product between the tensile stress direction [1 1 0] and each slip direction and slip plane normal.

(A) Direction: [1 1 0] . [-1 1 0] = -1 + 1 + 0 = 0
    Plane normal: [1 1 0] . [1 1 1] = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2
(B) Direction: [1 1 0] . [0 1 1] = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1
    Plane normal: [1 1 0] . [1 1 -1] = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2
(C) Direction: [1 1 0] . [0 1 1] = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1
    Plane normal: [1 1 0] . [1 -1 1] = 1 - 1 + 0 = 0
(D) Direction: [1 1 0] . [1 1 0] = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2
    Plane normal: [1 1 0] . [-1 1 -1] = -1 + 1 + 0 = 0

Step 2: Divide the dot product by the magnitudes of the corresponding vectors.

(A) Direction: 0 / (|1 1 0| * |-1 1 0|) = 0
    Plane normal: 2 / (|1 1 0| * |1 1 1|) = 2 / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)) = sqrt(2/3)
(B) Direction: 1 / (|1 1 0| * |0 1 1|) = 1 / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)) = 1/2
    Plane normal: 2 / (|1 1 0| * |1 1 -1|) = 2 / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)) = sqrt(2/3)
(C) Direction: 1 / (|1 1 0| * |0 1 1|) = 1 / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)) = 1/2
    Plane normal: 0 / (|1 1 0| * |1 -1 1|) = 0
(D) Direction: 2 / (|1 1 0| * |1 1 0|) = 2 / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)) = 1
    Plane normal: 0 / (|1 1 0| * |-1 1 -1|) = 0

Step 3: Calculate the Schmid factor (SF) for each slip system using the formula SF = |cosθ cosλ|

(A) SF = |0 * sqrt(2/3)| = 0
(B) SF = |(1/2) * sqrt(2/3)| = 1/2 * sqrt(2/3)
(C) SF = |(1/2) * 0| = 0
(D) SF = |1 * 0| = 0

The slip system with the highest Schmid factor has the highest probability of being activated. In this case, the slip system with the highest Schmid factor is (B) a/2 [0 1 1](1 1 -1).

So, the correct answer is [(B)].
