To find the entropy change (∆S) during the transformation of orthorhombic sulfur to monoclinic sulfur at 368.5 K, we can use the entropy changes given for heating orthorhombic sulfur and cooling monoclinic sulfur.

Entropy change for heating orthorhombic sulfur from 0K to 368.5 K: 36.86 J.K^(-1)
Entropy change for cooling monoclinic sulfur from 368.5K to 0 K: -37.8 J.K^(-1)

Since we are considering the transformation at 368.5 K, we can simply subtract the entropy change for heating orthorhombic sulfur from the entropy change for cooling monoclinic sulfur:

∆S = -37.8 J.K^(-1) - 36.86 J.K^(-1) = -74.66 J.K^(-1)

The entropy change for the transformation of orthorhombic sulfur to monoclinic sulfur at 368.5 K is -74.66 J.K^(-1).

Answer: [-74.66]
