We know that during wire drawing, the maximum attainable true strain per pass is given by,

$ε_max$ = (ln($A_i$/$A_f$))/n

Where, $A_i$ = Initial area of cross section of wire

       $A_f$ = Final area of cross section of wire

       n = Strain hardening exponent

We are given 

$σ$ = 50*$ε^(0.3)$

We know that, 

$σ$ = K$ε^n$

where, K and n are constants of proportionality

Comparing the above two equations, we get, 

n = 0.3

K = 50

We know that,

$σ$ = $\frac{(4f\:L\:d)}{(π\:d^2)}$

where, f = Flow stress 

Therefore, 

$ε$ = $\frac{(f)}{(K)}$

$ε_max$ = (ln($A_i$/$A_f$))/n = (ln(1/$r$))/n, where $r$ is the reduction in area

Now, 

$ε_max$ = $\frac{(f)}{(K)}$  

$f$ = 50*$ε_max^(0.3)$

Substituting the value of $f$ in the equation of flow stress, we get,

σ = (20000/π) * ($ε_max^(0.3)$)

Therefore, 

$ε_max$ = 0.046

Hence, the maximum strain per pass in annealed condition is $0.046$ (up to two decimal places).

Answer: 

- 0.046
