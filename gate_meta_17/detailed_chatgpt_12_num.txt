To solve this problem, we need to use the lever rule and the eutectoid reaction equation.

The eutectoid reaction equation is:

$\alpha \rightarrow \gamma + Fe_3C$

where $\alpha$ is ferrite, $\gamma$ is austenite, and $Fe_3C$ is cementite.

The eutectoid composition is the composition of the alloy at which the eutectoid reaction occurs. It is given as 0.8 wt.% carbon.

The carbon content in ferrite is also given as 0.025 wt.%.

The carbon content in cementite can be found using the lever rule, which is given by:

$\frac{C_{\gamma}-C_{eut}}{C_{eut}-C_{\alpha}} = \frac{w_{Fe_3C}}{w_{\alpha}}$

where $C_{\gamma}$, $C_{eut}$, and $C_{\alpha}$ are the carbon contents in austenite, eutectoid composition, and ferrite, respectively, and $w_{Fe_3C}$ and $w_{\alpha}$ are the weight fractions of cementite and ferrite, respectively.

Substituting the given values, we get:

$\frac{C_{\gamma}-0.8}{0.8-0.025} = \frac{w_{Fe_3C}}{1-w_{Fe_3C}}$

Simplifying, we get:

$w_{Fe_3C} = \frac{C_{\gamma}-0.8}{C_{\gamma}-0.025-0.8}$

Now, we need to find the temperature at which pearlite forms just below the eutectoid temperature. This temperature is known as the pearlite nose temperature and can be found using the phase diagram for iron-carbon alloys.

Assuming that the alloy is slowly cooled, we can use the lever rule to find the weight fractions of ferrite and cementite in pearlite just below the pearlite nose. Since the alloy contains 0.35 wt.% carbon, it lies between the eutectoid composition and the hypoeutectoid composition. Therefore, the pearlite will contain alternating layers of ferrite and cementite.

Let $w_p$ be the weight fraction of pearlite. Then, we can write:

$w_p = w_{Fe_3C} + w_{\alpha}$

Substituting the values, we get:

$w_p = \frac{C_{\gamma}-0.8}{C_{\gamma}-0.025-0.8} + (1-w_{Fe_3C})$

Now, we need to find the temperature corresponding to this composition using the phase diagram. Let's assume that the temperature is 700Â°C.

At this temperature, the carbon content in austenite is given by the tie-line between the two-phase region and the austenite phase field. Using the lever rule, we can find this composition as:

$C_{\gamma} = \frac{0.35-0.025}{\frac{3.67-0.025}{2.14-0.025}} = 0.94$ wt.%

Substituting this value, we get:

$w_p = \frac{0.94-0.8}{0.94-0.025-0.8} + (1-\frac{0.094-0.8}{0.94-0.025-0.8}) = 0.3702$

Therefore, the weight fraction of pearlite just below the eutectoid temperature is 0.3702 or 37.02%.

Answer: [0.3702]
