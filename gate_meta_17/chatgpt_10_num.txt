The linear shrinkage can be calculated using the formula:

Linear shrinkage = (1 - final length/initial length) x 100%

Since the density is directly proportional to length cubed, we can use the following relation:

(density_ratio)^(1/3) = length_ratio

where density_ratio and length_ratio are the ratios of the final and initial densities and lengths, respectively.

Using the given data:

density_ratio = 0.865 / 1 = 0.865
length_ratio = (0.865^(1/3)) / (0.55^(1/3)) = 1.1282

Therefore, the linear shrinkage is:

(1 - 1.1282) x 100% = -12.82%

Answer: [-12.82%]
