Chvorinov's rule states that the solidification time (Ts) is proportional to the square of the volume-to-surface area ratio (V/A) of the casting:

Ts = k * (V/A)^n,

where n is the exponent, k is a constant, V is the volume, and A is the surface area.

For the cubic casting:
V1 = 5.0 * 5.0 * 5.0 = 125 cm³
A1 = 6 * 5.0 * 5.0 = 150 cm²
Ts1 = 1.6 min

For the cylindrical riser:
Diameter = d
Height = h
Diameter-to-height ratio = d/h = 0.5
d = 0.5 * h

V2 = π * (d/2)^2 * h = π * (0.25 * h^2)
A2 = 2 * π * (d/2)^2 + 2 * π * (d/2) * h = 0.5 * π * h^2 + π * d * h

Ts2 = 3.2 min

Now, we apply Chvorinov's rule for the cubic casting and cylindrical riser, and divide the equations:

Ts2/Ts1 = ((V2/A2) / (V1/A1))^n

3.2 / 1.6 = ((V2/A2) / (125/150))^2

2 = ((V2/A2) / (5/6))^2

Solving for V2/A2:

(V2/A2) = (5/6) * sqrt(2)

Now, plugging in the volume and surface area of the cylindrical riser:

(π * (0.25 * h^2)) / (0.5 * π * h^2 + π * d * h) = (5/6) * sqrt(2)

Canceling out π:

(0.25 * h^2) / (0.5 * h^2 + d * h) = (5/6) * sqrt(2)

Substituting d = 0.5 * h:

(0.25 * h^2) / (0.5 * h^2 + 0.5 * h^2) = (5/6) * sqrt(2)

Solving for h:

h^2 / h^2 = (5/6) * sqrt(2)
h = sqrt((5/6) * sqrt(2))
h ≈ 1.22 cm

So, the height of the riser is approximately 1.22 cm. The answer is [1.22].
