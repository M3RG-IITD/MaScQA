To find the specific energy consumption, we can use the formula:

Specific Energy Consumption (SEC) = (Voltage * Current * 3600) / (Cathodic Current Efficiency * Atomic Weight * Faraday's Constant)

Given:
Voltage (V) = 3.5 V
Current (I) = 400 A
Cathodic Current Efficiency (CCE) = 90% = 0.9
Atomic Weight of Zn (AW) = 65
Faraday's Constant (F) = 96485 C/mol

Now substituting the given values in the formula:

SEC = (3.5 * 400 * 3600) / (0.9 * 65 * 96485)
SEC = (5040000) / (525825)
SEC = 9.58 kJ.kg^(-1) zinc

The specific energy consumption is [9.58] kJ.kg^(-1) zinc.
