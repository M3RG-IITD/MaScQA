We are given the following information:

- σ(maximum) = 200 MPa
- σ(minimum) = 0
- Initial crack length, a₀ = 1 mm = 0.001 m
- da/dN = $10^(-12) (ΔK)^3$

To find the length of the crack after one million cycles, we first need to find the stress intensity factor range, ΔK.

ΔK = K(max) - K(min)

Since σ(minimum) = 0, K(min) = 0. Therefore, we only need to find K(max).

K(max) = Y * σ(max) * √(π * a)

where Y is a geometric factor (assumed to be 1 for simplicity) and σ(max) is the maximum stress.

K(max) = 1 * 200 * √(π * 0.001)
K(max) ≈ 355.67 MPa.m^(1/2)

Now, we can find the crack growth rate, da/dN.

da/dN = $10^(-12) (ΔK)^3$
da/dN = $10^(-12) (355.67)^3$
da/dN ≈ 4.498 × 10^(-11)

Since we want to find the length of the crack after one million cycles (N = 10^6):

Δa = (da/dN) * N
Δa = 4.498 × 10^(-11) * 10^6
Δa ≈ 0.04498 m

Now we add this growth to the initial crack length:

a₁ = a₀ + Δa
a₁ = 0.001 + 0.04498
a₁ ≈ 0.04598 m

The length of the crack after one million cycles will be approximately 0.046 m.
