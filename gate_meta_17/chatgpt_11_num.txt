The radius of the largest sphere that can fit in the tetrahedral void of a FCC lattice can be calculated using the formula:

r = (sqrt(2)/4) * a

where r is the radius of the sphere and a is the lattice parameter.

Substituting the given values, we get:

r = (sqrt(2)/4) * 0.401 nm
r = 0.141 nm

Therefore, the radius of the largest sphere that can fit in the tetrahedral void of a FCC lattice is 0.141 nm.

Answer: [0.141]
