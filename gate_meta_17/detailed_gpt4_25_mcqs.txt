Dye penetrant test, also known as liquid penetrant inspection (LPI) or penetrant testing (PT), is a non-destructive testing (NDT) method used to detect surface-breaking defects, such as cracks, in non-porous materials like metals, plastics, and ceramics.

Let's analyze each option of the question and identify the correct answer:

(A) Polarizes sound waves in liquid
This principle refers to the use of sound waves passing through a liquid medium. This principle is applied in Ultrasonic Testing (UT), which is a non-destructive testing method that uses sound waves to detect internal defects in materials. This is not the principle used in dye penetrant testing.

(B) Magnetic domain
Magnetic domain refers to the behavior of ferromagnetic materials when subjected to magnetic fields. The principle based on magnetic domains is used in Magnetic Particle Inspection (MPI), another non-destructive testing method that is used to detect surface and subsurface defects in ferromagnetic materials. This is not the principle behind dye penetrant testing.

(C) Absorption of X-rays
This principle refers to the absorption of X-rays when they pass through a material, forming an image based on the varying absorption rates by different parts of the material. This principle is applied in Radiographic Testing (RT), a non-destructive testing method that uses X-rays or gamma rays to inspect internal defects in materials. This is not the principle used in dye penetrant testing.

(D) Capillary action
Capillary action is the ability of a liquid to flow in narrow spaces without the assistance of external forces, such as gravity. It occurs due to the combination of cohesive and adhesive forces within the liquid and the material in contact. In the dye penetrant test, the penetrant liquid is applied to the surface of the material, and capillary action allows the liquid to enter surface-breaking defects. The excess penetrant is removed from the surface, and then a developer is applied to draw out the penetrant from the defects, creating visible indications of the defects. This is the correct principle behind dye penetrant testing.

So, the correct answer is:
