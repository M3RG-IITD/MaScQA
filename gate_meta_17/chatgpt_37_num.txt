First, we need to calculate the equilibrium constant (K) at 1600Â°C (1873 K):
logK = (1160/1873) + 2.003
logK = 0.922
K = 8.452

Next, we can set up an ICE table to determine the concentration of each species at equilibrium:

C + O = CO
I      0.007   0
C      -x       -x
E      0.007-x x

We know that the initial concentration of C is 0.7 wt.% or 0.007, and the initial concentration of O is unknown (let's call it y).

At equilibrium, the concentration of CO is also equal to y (assuming no other reactions occur).

Using the equilibrium constant expression, we can write:
K = [CO] / ([C] * [O])

Plugging in the concentrations at equilibrium:
8.452 = y / (0.007-x)(y)

Since the activity coefficients for both C and O are assumed to be unity, we can simplify to:
8.452 = y / (0.007-x)y

Solving for y:
y = 4.413 x 10^-5

Converting to weight percent:
0.004413%

Therefore, the dissolved oxygen content of the steel melt is 0.0044 wt.% (rounded to four decimal places). 

Answer: [0.0044 wt.%]
