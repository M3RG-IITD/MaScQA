The equation for de-carburization rate is: 

dC/dt = -(c-c*)

We are given the equilibrium concentration of carbon in steel, c* = 0.04 wt.%. We are also given the initial concentration of carbon in steel, c(t=0) = 0.4 wt.%. 

Using the equation for de-carburization rate, we can set up a differential equation:

dC/dt = -(c-c*)
dC/-(c-c*) = dt

Integrating both sides, we get: 

-ln|c-c*| = t + k

where k is the constant of integration. We can solve for k using the initial condition c(t=0) = 0.4:

-ln|0.4-0.04| = 0 + k
k = -ln(0.36)

So the equation for c is:

-ln|c-0.04| = t - ln(0.36)

Taking the exponential of both sides, we get:

|c-0.04| = exp(-t+ln(0.36)) = 0.36 exp(-t)

Since c cannot be negative, we can remove the absolute value:

c-0.04 = 0.36 exp(-t)  (if c > 0.04)
c-0.04 = -0.36 exp(-t) (if c < 0.04)

Since our initial condition c(t=0) = 0.4 is greater than c*, the solution is:

c-0.04 = 0.36 exp(-t)

Adding 0.04 to both sides, we get:

c = 0.04 + 0.36 exp(-t)

We want to find c at t = 1 min:

c = 0.04 + 0.36 exp(-1) = 0.086

Therefore, the concentration of carbon in steel at t=1 min is 0.086 wt.%.
