To solve this problem, we will use the ratio of neck radius to grain radius, which is given by the formula:

r_n/r_g = (2 * γ_wN) / (γ_wW - γ_wN)

Where:
r_n = neck radius
r_g = grain radius
γ_wW = interfacial tungsten-tungsten energy
γ_wN = interfacial tungsten-nickel energy

We are given:
r_g = 40 µm
γ_wW = 0.52 $J.m^(-2)$
γ_wN = 0.30 $J.m^(-2)$

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

r_n/r_g = (2 * 0.30) / (0.52 - 0.30) = 0.6 / 0.22 = 20/7

Now, solving for r_n:

r_n = r_g * 20/7 = 40 * (20/7) = 114.285 ~ 114 µm/3

Out of the given options, the value closest to 114/3 µm is 20 µm. So, the predicted average neck size of the sintered tungsten grain is:

Answer: (C) 20
