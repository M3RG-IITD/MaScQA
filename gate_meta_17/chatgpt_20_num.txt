The volumetric strain can be calculated using the equation:

volumetric strain = - lateral strain / Poisson's ratio 

The lateral strain can be calculated using the Poisson's ratio and the axial strain:

lateral strain = Poisson's ratio * axial strain 

Given that the axial strain is 0.02 and Poisson's ratio is 0.3, we can calculate the lateral strain:

lateral strain = 0.3 * 0.02 = 0.006

Substituting these values in the equation for volumetric strain:

volumetric strain = - 0.006 / 0.3 = -0.02

Rounding off to three decimal places, the volumetric strain is -0.020.

Therefore, the answer is:
-0.020
