To solve this problem, we can use the relationship between the solubility of hydrogen in Palladium and the pressure of hydrogen, given by Sieverts' Law. Sieverts' Law states that the concentration of the dissolved gas (hydrogen) is proportional to the square root of the pressure of the gas.

Let's denote the solubility of hydrogen in Palladium as S and the pressure of hydrogen as P. According to Sieverts' Law, we can write:

S ∝ √P

Now let's use the given values to find the proportionality constant:

At 300°C and P(H₂) = 1 atm, S = 1.64*10^4 mm³ (STP) per kg of Pd. Therefore,

S₁ = k * √P₁

1.64 * 10^4 = k * √1

k = 1.64 * 10^4

Now we can use the value of k to find the solubility of hydrogen at 300°C and P(H₂) = 0.09 atm:

S₂ = k * √P₂

S₂ = (1.64 * 10^4) * √0.09

S₂ = 1.64 * 10^4 * 0.3
S₂ = 4920 mm³ (STP) per kg of Pd.

Thus, the solubility of hydrogen in Palladium at 300°C and P(H₂) = 0.09 atm is 4920 mm³(STP) per kg of Pd.

The final answer is: [4920]
