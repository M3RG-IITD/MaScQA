We'll solve this equation using Bragg's Law:

nλ = 2d * sinθ

In this case, n = 2 (since we need the second peak), and λ = 0.154 nm (the given wavelength for CuKα).

For a face-centered cubic (FCC) metal, the interplanar spacing (d) can be calculated using the following formula:

d = a / √(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)

where a is the lattice parameter, and h, k, l are the Miller indices.

For the second peak in the X-ray diffraction pattern for an FCC lattice, we will have Miller indices (hkl) = (200). So we have:

d = 0.36 nm / √(2^2 + 0^2 + 0^2) = 0.36 nm / √4 = 0.18 nm

Now, we can plug in these values into Bragg's Law:

2 (0.154 nm) = 2 * 0.18 nm * sinθ

Solving for θ:

sinθ = (2 * 0.154 nm) / (2 * 0.18 nm) = 0.308 nm / 0.36 nm ≈ 0.85556

θ = arcsin(0.85556) ≈ 58.43°

So, the Bragg angle θ for the second peak in the powder X-ray diffraction pattern of a FCC metal is approximately 58.43°.
