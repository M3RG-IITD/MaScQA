We are given the following information:

Density (ρ) = 19000 kg.m^(-3)
Lattice parameter (a) = 0.4 nm = 0.4 × 10^(-9) m
Atomic weight (A) = 183 g.mol^(-1)

We need to find the effective number of atoms in the unit cell (Z).

First, let's calculate the volume of the unit cell:
V = a^3 = (0.4 × 10^(-9))^3 = 6.4 × 10^(-29) m^3

Now, let's consider the mass of the unit cell (m). This is related to the density (ρ), volume (V), and Avogadro's number (N_A) by the formula:

m = ρ × V = 19000 × 6.4 × 10^(-29) = 1.216 × 10^(-24) kg

To find the effective number of atoms in the unit cell (Z), we also need to know the molar mass (M) of the metal. This can be found by dividing the atomic weight (A) by Avogadro's number (N_A):

M = A / N_A = 183 / (6.022 × 10^(23)) = 3.038 × 10^(-25) kg.atom^(-1)

Now, we can calculate the effective number of atoms (Z) in the unit cell using the mass of the unit cell (m) and the molar mass (M) of the metal:

Z = m / M = (1.216 × 10^(-24)) / (3.038 × 10^(-25)) ≈ 4

Hence, the effective number of atoms in the unit cell of this metal is approximately 4.
