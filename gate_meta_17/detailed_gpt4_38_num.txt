Given:
$ΔH°_{298}$(CO → CO$_2$) = -282000 kJ.(kg-mol CO)$^{-1}$, $C_p$(CO$_2$) = 44 kJ.(kg-mol K)$^{-1}$
Molar flow rate of CO entering the reactor: $1\,\text{kg-mol}\,\text{h}^{-1}$

The balanced stoichiometric equation for the combustion of CO with pure oxygen is: $$CO + \frac{1}{2} O_2 \rightarrow CO_2$$

Since we are given the adiabatic flame temperature, we can assume that there is no heat lost to the surroundings during the combustion process:

$$Q = 0$$

For an adiabatic process between the temperature range of $T_1$ (298 K) and $T_2$ (flame temperature), the enthalpy change is described as:

$$ΔH_{298} = nC_p(T_2 - T_1)$$

$ΔH_{298}$: enthalpy change at 298 K
$n$: moles of CO$_2$ being formed (since the combustion is stoichiometric - this is equal to the moles of CO being fed into the system)
$C_p$: heat capacity at constant pressure of CO$_2$
$T_2$: adiabatic flame temperature in K
$T_1$: initial temperature = 298K or 25ºC

We know that, 

$n^* = 1\,\text{kg-mol}\,\text{h}^{-1}$
$C_p^* = 44\,\text{kJ}\,(\text{kg-mol}\,\text{K})^{-1}$
$ΔH_{298}^* = -282000\,\text{kJ}\,(\text{kg-mol}\,\text{CO})^{-1}$

Substituting the given values to compute $T_2$.

$$-282000\,\text{kJ}(kg-mol\,\text{CO})^{-1} = 1\,\text{kg-mol}\,\text{h}^{-1} \times 44\,\text{kJ}\,(\text{kg-mol}\,\text{K})^{-1} \times (T_2 - 298\,\text{K})$$

Solving for $T_2$:

$$T_2 - 298\,\text{K} = \frac{-282000\,\text{kJ}(kg-mol\,\text{CO})^{-1}}{1\,\text{kg-mol}\,\text{h}^{-1} \times 44\,\text{kJ}\,(\text{kg-mol}\,\text{K})^{-1}}$$

$$T_2 - 298\,\text{K} = \frac{-282000}{44}$$

$$T_2 - 298\,\text{K} = -6409.09$$

$$T_2 = 298 - 6409.09 = -6111.09\,\text{K}$$

However, it's important to notice that we obtained a negative value for the temperature, which is not physically possible. The issue lies in the assumption made for the enthalpy change, as it is not accurate for the entire temperature range considered.

To obtain the correct adiabatic flame temperature value, more detailed calculations are required, considering the overall enthalpy change and the heat capacity relationship as a function of temperature. 

In summary, the current assumption made to calculate the flame temperature is not accurate, and thus a more detailed analysis is needed to find a physically meaningful value. 

Answer: Invalid assumption
