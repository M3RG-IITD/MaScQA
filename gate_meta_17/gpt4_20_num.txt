We can find the volumetric strain by applying the formula:

Volumetric Strain = (1 - 2 × Poisson's Ratio) × Axial Strain

Given, Poisson's Ratio = 0.3 and Axial Strain = 0.02.

Volumetric Strain = (1 - 2 × 0.3) × 0.02
Volumetric Strain = (1 - 0.6) × 0.02
Volumetric Strain = 0.4 × 0.02
Volumetric Strain = 0.008

So, the Volumetric Strain is 0.008 (up to three decimal places).

Answer: [0.008]
