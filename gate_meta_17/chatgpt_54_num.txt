We can begin by visualizing the situation:

The angle of bite (α) is the angle between the tangent to the roll surface and the direction of travel of the slab. We can use trigonometry to find the actual angle between the roll surface and the slab:

θ = 90° - α

θ = 90° - 10°

θ = 80°

Now, considering a small element of the slab as it enters the roll gap:

We can see that the thickness of the slab (t) is reduced by the amount of compression (δ) as it passes through the roll gap. The arc length of the roll surface contacted by the slab during the bite is given by:

s = rθ

s = 0.45 m × 80°

s = 0.45 m × 1.396 radians

s = 0.627 m

The volume of the slab entering the roll gap is:

V = s × t

The volume of the slab leaving the roll gap is:

V - ΔV = s × (t - δ)

We can equate these two volumes and solve for δ:

s × t = s × (t - δ) + ΔV

δ = (ΔV / s)

We are not given any specific information about ΔV, but we know that the maximum possible reduction would occur if the entire thickness of the slab entered the roll gap during the bite. In this case, ΔV would be the volume of the slab that is removed during the bite:

ΔV = s × t

Substituting this into our equation for δ:

δ = (s × t) / s

δ = t

Therefore, the maximum possible reduction during rolling is equal to the original thickness of the slab, which is 250 mm.

Answer: 
- 250 mm.
