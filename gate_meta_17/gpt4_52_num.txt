First, let's find the resilience and toughness separately.

Resilience is the amount of energy per unit volume that a material can absorb while staying in its elastic region. For a linear elastic material, the formula for resilience is:

Resilience = (1/2) * σ_y * ε_y

where σ_y is the yield strength and ε_y is the yield strain.

Let's first determine the yield strain, which is the strain at which the material yields, using Young's modulus (E):

E = σ_y / ε_y
ε_y = σ_y / E
ε_y = 450×10^6 Pa / 4.5×10^9 Pa
ε_y = 0.1

Now we can find the resilience:

Resilience = (1/2) * 450×10^6 Pa * 0.1
Resilience = 22.5×10^6 J/m³

Next, we need to find the toughness, which is the amount of energy per unit volume that a material can absorb before fracturing. We can find this by calculating the area under the stress-strain curve up to the fracture strain. In this case, the stress-strain curve can be divided into two regions, the linear elastic region (where stress is proportional to strain) and the plastic region (where stress is constant).

For the linear elastic region, the area under the stress-strain curve is a triangle with the base equal to the yield strain (ε_y) and the height equal to the yield strength (σ_y):

Area (linear elastic region) = (1/2) * σ_y * ε_y
Area (linear elastic region) = (1/2) * 450×10^6 Pa * 0.1
Area (linear elastic region) = 22.5×10^6 J/m³

For the plastic region, the area under the stress-strain curve is a rectangle with the base equal to the difference between the fracture strain (ε_f) and the yield strain (ε_y) and the height equal to the yield strength (σ_y):

Area (plastic region) = σ_y * (ε_f - ε_y)
Area (plastic region) = 450×10^6 Pa * (0.45 - 0.1)
Area (plastic region) = 450×10^6 Pa * 0.35
Area (plastic region) = 157.5×10^6 J/m³

Now we can find the toughness by adding the area of the two regions:

Toughness = Area (linear elastic region) + Area (plastic region)
Toughness = 22.5×10^6 J/m³ + 157.5×10^6 J/m³
Toughness = 180×10^6 J/m³

Finally, we can determine the ratio of resilience to toughness:

Ratio = Resilience / Toughness
Ratio = 22.5×10^6 J/m³ / 180×10^6 J/m³
Ratio = 0.125

The ratio of resilience to toughness for this material is approximately 0.125. Thus, the answer is [0.125].
