When a ladle containing molten steel is being discharged, four forces act on it:
1. Pressure force (P)
2. Inertial force (Q)
3. Gravity force (R)
4. Viscous force (S)

The corresponding expressions for these forces are given in Column II as follows:

1. µUL
2. $ρgL^3$
3. $ρU^2L^2$
4. $PL^2$

Now, we need to match the forces with their corresponding expressions.

The Pressure force (P) is given by $PL^2$, so it matches with (4)

The Inertial force (Q) is given by $ρU^2L^2$, so it matches with (3)

The Gravity force (R) is given by $ρgL^3$, so it matches with (2)

The Viscous force (S) is given by µUL, so it matches with (1)

Therefore, the correct match is:

(A) P-4; Q-3; R-2; S-1
