During the end blow period in LD steelmaking, the de-carburization rate is expressed by the equation: dC/dt = -(c-c*). Here, c and c* are the instantaneous and equilibrium concentration of carbon in steel respectively, in units of wt.%. Given that c* = 0.04 wt.% and c( t = 0 min) = 0.4 wt.%, the concentration of carbon in steel (in wt.%) at t= 1 min is? (answer up to three decimal places)
