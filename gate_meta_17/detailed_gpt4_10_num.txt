To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:

1. Determine the initial volume, final volume, and volume shrinkage.
2. Calculate the linear shrinkage in each dimension.
3. Find the linear shrinkage percentage.

Here's a detailed, step-by-step explanation:

1. Initial volume, final volume, and volume shrinkage

First, let's find the volume shrinkage. We are given that the green density is 55% and the final density after sintering is 86.5% of the theoretical density. 

The volume shrinkage can be found using the following formula:

Volume shrinkage = (Initial density - Final density) / Initial density = (Green density - Sintered density) / Green density

Green density = 0.55
Sintered density = 0.865

Volume shrinkage = (0.55 - 0.865) / 0.55 = -0.315 / 0.55 ≈ -0.5727

2. Linear shrinkage in each dimension

Since we assume uniform shrinkage, the linear shrinkage in each of the three dimensions (x, y, z) would be equal. Let's call this linear shrinkage value L. The volume of a rectangular object can be written as V = x * y * z. 

If the volume shrinks uniformly, then the new volume after shrinkage can be written as:

New volume = (x - L) * (y - L) * (z - L)

Since we have the volume shrinkage, we can find the relationship between the old volume and the new volume. 

New volume = (Initial volume) * (1 + Volume shrinkage)

Now, we can substitute the formula for the new volume and solve for the linear shrinkage value L.

(x - L) * (y - L) * (z - L) = x * y * z * (1 + Volume shrinkage)

3. Find linear shrinkage percentage

Let's say that the initial dimensions of the object are a, b, and c. Then, the initial volume can be written as V = a * b * c.

To find the linear shrinkage percentage, we can use the following formula:

Linear shrinkage percentage = (L / a) * 100

In this problem, we are assuming that a = b = c, as the three dimensions undergo uniform shrinkage. 

Now, we can rewrite the formula in terms of the volume shrinkage:

Linear shrinkage percentage = (L / a) * 100 = (1 + Volume shrinkage)^(1/3) * 100 - 100

Plugging in the values we found earlier:

Linear shrinkage percentage = (1 - 0.5727)^(1/3) * 100 - 100 ≈ 0.5774 * 100 - 100 ≈ -42.26%

So, the linear shrinkage is approximately -42.26%. The negative sign indicates a reduction in size.

The answer is [-42.26].
