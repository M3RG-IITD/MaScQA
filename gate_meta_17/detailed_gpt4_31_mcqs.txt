In order to determine the correct standard free energy change versus temperature plot, let's first examine the thermodynamic properties of the given oxidation reaction.

A(s) + O2(g) = AO2(s)

We know that the standard free energy change (ΔG°) is related to the equilibrium constant (K) and standard entropy change (ΔS°) as follows:

ΔG° = -RT ln(K)

where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature and ΔG° is the standard free energy change. Furthermore, we know from the equation:

ΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS°,

where ΔH° is the standard enthalpy change and T is the temperature. As the temperature increases, the equilibrium shifts in such a way that TΔS° increases to balance the temperature effect on ΔG°. Since T₁ < T₂, the reaction is favored at lower temperatures (i.e., T < T₁) and becomes more spontaneous.

Now, let's examine each of the given schematic plots (A), (B), (C), and (D) to determine the correct one.

(A): In this plot, ΔG° decreases as the temperature increases which suggests that the reaction becomes less spontaneous at higher temperatures. This contradicts our previous finding so option (A) cannot be the correct answer.

(B): In this plot, ΔG° increases as the temperature increases which suggests that the reaction becomes more spontaneous at higher temperatures. This contradicts our previous finding so option (B) cannot be the correct answer.

(C): In this plot, ΔG° remains the same for all temperatures which suggests that the reaction is not affected by temperature changes. This contradicts our previous finding so option (C) cannot be the correct answer.

(D): In this plot, ΔG° initially decreases as the temperature increases (T < T₁) but then starts to increase (T > T₁) which suggests that the reaction is initially favored at lower temperatures but becomes less spontaneous at higher temperatures beyond T₁. This agrees with our previous findings as we concluded that the reaction is favored at temperatures below T₁.

Thus, the correct standard free energy change versus temperature plot is (D).
