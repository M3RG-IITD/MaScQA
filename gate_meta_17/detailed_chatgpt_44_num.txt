Without a diagram or further information, it is difficult to provide a detailed step-by-step explanation. However, here is a general approach to solving a predominance area diagram problem:

1. Identify the species present in the system and their possible solid phases.
2. Determine the conditions under which each phase is the most stable (i.e. its predominance area).
3. Sketch the predominance area diagram.
4. Identify the slopes of the lines separating the predominance areas.

Assuming we have a diagram, we can apply this approach as follows:

1. Let's assume we have a system with two species, A and B, and their possible solid phases are denoted by α and β.
2. We determine the predominance areas for each phase by considering the conditions at which their Gibbs free energy of formation is the most negative. For example, if ΔG_f(α) < ΔG_f(β), then phase α is more stable than phase β under those conditions. We do this for all possible combinations of conditions (e.g. temperature and pressure).
3. We sketch the predominance area diagram, which shows the stability regions for each phase. For example, if phase α is more stable at low temperatures and high pressures, then its predominance area would be located in that region of the diagram. The lines separating the stability regions indicate the conditions at which the two phases are equally stable (i.e. their Gibbs free energies of formation are equal).
4. To find the slope of line BC, we need to identify the conditions at which phases α and β are equally stable along that line. We can do this by writing the expression for the Gibbs free energy of formation of each phase as a function of the relevant variables (e.g. concentration, temperature, pressure) and setting them equal to each other. Then we solve for the relevant variable (e.g. concentration) to find the condition at which the two phases are equally stable. Finally, we take the derivative of that equation with respect to the other variable (e.g. pressure) to find the slope.

Without the diagram or further information, we cannot proceed with this calculation. Therefore, we cannot provide a final answer to the question.
