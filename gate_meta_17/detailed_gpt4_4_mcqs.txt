We are given a Pressure-Volume (P-V) diagram with isothermal curves at temperatures T1, T2, and T3. The question is asking us to find the correct order of the temperatures. To do this, we will use some principles of thermodynamics and the ideal gas law.

1. Ideal Gas Law: The ideal gas law is given by the equation PV = nRT, where P is pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature. Since we have one mole of gas (n = 1), the ideal gas law becomes PV = RT for each curve.

2. Isothermal curves: An isothermal process is a process that occurs at a constant temperature. In a P-V diagram, the isothermal curves represent the relationship between pressure and volume at constant temperatures.

3. Observations from the P-V diagram:

Let's analyze the given P-V diagram:

At any particular volume (let's say V1), the pressures at the different temperatures can be represented as P1, P2, and P3, respectively.

From the ideal gas law (PV = RT), we can write:
P1V1 = RT1
P2V1 = RT2
P3V1 = RT3

Now let's compare the temperature ratios by dividing the equations:

(P1V1)/(P2V1) = RT1/RT2
(P1/P2) = T1/T2

Similarly,

(P2V1)/(P3V1) = RT2/RT3
(P2/P3) = T2/T3

Since the volume V1 is the same in each case, the ratios of pressures will be the same as the ratios of temperatures.

4. Interpretation of the P-V diagram:

Now let's determine the order of the temperatures by comparing the pressures:

At any particular volume (let's say V1), we can see that:
P1 > P2 > P3

From our observation in step 3, this means that:
T1 > T2 > T3

Thus, the correct answer is (A) T1> T2> T3, i.e., the temperatures have the same order as the pressures at any given volume for an isothermal process involving one mole of ideal gas.

Answer: [(A) T1> T2> T3]
