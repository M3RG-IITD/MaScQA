Given data, 
Ambient temperature, T∞ = 298 K
Emissivity of steel, ε = 0.8
Convective heat transfer coefficient, h = 4.6 W/m2.K
Stefan- Boltzmann constant, σ = 5.7 × 10^(-8) W/m2.K4
Area of the slab, A = 1 × 1 = 1 m2
Thickness of slab, L = 0.1 m
Temperature of slab, T1 = 1298 K

Now, we need to find the rate of heat loss from the top surface of the slab by radiation and convection. 

Let q̇ be the rate of heat loss. 

Heat loss by radiation: 

q̇ rad = εσA(T1^4-T∞^4)

Substituting the given values, 

q̇ rad = 0.8 × 5.7 × 10^(-8) × 1 × (1298^4-298^4)
q̇rad = 861.51 W

Heat loss by convection: 

q̇ conv = hA(T1-T∞)

Substituting the given values, 

q̇ conv = 4.6 × 1 × (1298-298)
q̇ conv = 4608 W

Hence, the total initial rate of heat loss from the top surface of the slab by radiation and convection is given by 

q̇ = q̇ rad + q̇ conv
q̇ = 861.51 + 4608
q̇ = 5469.51 W

Therefore, the initial rate of heat loss from the top surface of the slab by radiation and convection is 5469.51 KW.
