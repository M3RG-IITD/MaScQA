We are given that the solubility product constant $(K_{sp})$ for $Fe(OH)_3$ is $10^{-39}$. The dissolved equilibrium reaction can be represented as follows:

$Fe(OH)_3 \rightleftharpoons Fe^{+3} + 3OH^-$

We can express the solubility product constant as:

$K_{sp} = [Fe^{+3}][OH^-]^3$

We are also given that the concentration of $Fe^{+3}$ is $10^{-3}$ M. Let the concentration of $OH^-$ be x M, then we can write the equation as follows:

$10^{-39} = (10^{-3})(x)^3$

We need to find the value of x, which is the concentration of $OH^-$.

$x^3 = \frac{10^{-39}}{10^{-3}}$

$x^3 = 10^{-36}$

$x = \sqrt[3]{10^{-36}}$

$x = 10^{-12}$ M

Now we can find the pOH and then the pH.

$pOH = -\log{[OH^-]}$

$pOH = -\log{(10^{-12})}$

$pOH = 12$

Since $pH + pOH = 14$,

$pH = 14 - pOH$

$pH = 14 - 12$

$pH = 2$

So the minimum pH at which $Fe^{+3}$ will precipitate as $Fe(OH)_3$ is 2. The answer is [2].
