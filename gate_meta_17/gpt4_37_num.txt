We are given the reaction: C + O = CO(g)
logK = (1160/T) + 2.003

First, we have to find the equilibrium constant K at 1600 °C:
T = 1600 °C + 273.15 = 1873.15 K (converting to Kelvin)

logK = (1160/1873.15) + 2.003
logK = 0.6182 + 2.003
logK = 2.6212

Now, take the antilog:
K = 10^logK
K = 10^2.6212
K = 418.98

The Henrian activity coefficient is given as unity, so we can write an equilibrium expression for the reaction:

K = [CO(g)] / ([C] * [O])

We know that the plain carbon steel melt has 0.7 wt.% C, and we want to find the dissolved oxygen content (in wt.%):

Let x = dissolved oxygen content in wt.%, so:
[C] = 0.7 wt.% C
[O] = x wt.% O

The amount of CO(g) produced at equilibrium will be equal to the amount combined of C and O, which is (0.7 + x) wt.% CO(g). Thus,

[CO(g)] = (0.7 + x) wt.% CO(g)

Now, we can substitute these values into the equilibrium expression:

418.98 = [(0.7 + x)] / (0.7 * x)

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by (0.7 * x) and then solve:

x = 0.0127 wt.%

So, the dissolved oxygen content is approximately 0.0127 wt.%.

The correct answer inside a list is: [0.0127]
