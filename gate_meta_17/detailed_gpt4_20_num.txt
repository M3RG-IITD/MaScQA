To find the volumetric strain, we need to first understand the concept of Poisson's ratio and how it relates to the problem statement.

Poisson's ratio (ν) is defined as the negative ratio of transverse strain (lateral or radial) to the longitudinal strain (axial) in a material subjected to uniaxial stress. In other words, it describes the relative deformation that occurs in a material in the transverse direction compared to the longitudinal (axial) direction when a rod is deformed elastically.

Given, the longitudinal strain (axial) = 0.02
Poisson's ratio (ν) = 0.3

Now, let's find the transverse strain.

Transverse strain (lateral) = -(Poisson's ratio × longitudinal strain)
= - (0.3 × 0.02)
= -0.006

Now we have both the longitudinal strain (axial) and the transverse strain (lateral). We can find the volumetric strain by using the following formula.

Volumetric strain = longitudinal strain + 2 × transverse strain

Substitute the values we found earlier:

Volumetric strain = 0.02 + 2 × (-0.006)
Volumetric strain = 0.02 - 0.012
Volumetric strain = 0.008

So, the volumetric strain is 0.008.

Answer: [0.008]
