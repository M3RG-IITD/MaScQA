To find the fracture strength of a brittle material, we will use the "Griffith's criterion for brittle fracture." The equation for this criterion is:

σ_f = (2 * E * γ) / (π * a)

Where:
σ_f = fracture strength (MPa)
E = Young's modulus (GPa)
γ = surface energy (J/m²)
a = crack length (µm)

First, let's convert the Young's modulus from GPa to MPa.

1 GPa = 1000 MPa
E = 60 GPa = 60 * 1000 MPa = 60000 MPa

Now, let's plug in the given values and solve for the fracture strength.

σ_f = (2 * 60000 * 0.5) / (π * 2)
σ_f = (60000) / (π)

Now, let's approximate the numerical value of the σ_f.

σ_f ≈ (60000) / (3.14) 
σ_f ≈ 19108.28 MPa

Therefore, the fracture strength of the material is approximately 19108.28 MPa (up to two decimal places).

Answer: [19108.28]
