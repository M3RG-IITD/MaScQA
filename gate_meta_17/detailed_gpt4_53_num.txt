Chvorinov's equation states:

t = k(V^2/A)

where t is the total time for solidification, k is a constant, V is the volume of the casting and A is the total surface area. Since the exponent (n) given is 2, the equation becomes:

t = k(V/A)

For the cubic casting, the dimensions are 5cm * 5cm * 5cm. The volume and surface area can be calculated as:
 
V_cube = L * W * H = 5 * 5 * 5 = 125 cm^3

A_cube = 6 * L^2 = 6 * (5^2) = 150 cm^2 

Given that the total time for solidification of the cubic casting is 1.6 min, we can determine the constant 'k':

1.6 = k * (125/150)
k = 1.6 * (150/125)
k = 1.92

Now let's analyze the cylindrical riser. It's given that the diameter to height ratio is 0.5. Therefore, 

D = 0.5 * H

where D is the diameter and H is the height. 

The volume and surface area of the cylinder can be calculated as follows:

V_cyl = π * (D/2)^2 * H = π * (0.5*H)^2 * H = π * (0.25*H^3)

A_cyl = 2 * π * (D/2) * H + 2 * π * (D/2)^2 = π * D * H + π * (D/2)^2 = π * (0.5*H*H + 0.125*H^2)

The total time for solidification of the riser is 3.2 min. We know the value of 'k' (1.92) from before, so we can apply Chvorinov's rule for the riser:

3.2 = 1.92 * (V_cyl/A_cyl)

Substitute the expressions obtained for V_cyl and A_cyl:

3.2 = 1.92 * (π * (0.25*H^3) / (π * (0.5*H*H + 0.125*H^2)))

Since π is present in both the numerator and denominator, they cancel out:

3.2 = 1.92 * (0.25*H^3 / (0.5*H^2 + 0.125*H^2))

Next, divide both sides of the equation by 1.92:

3.2 / 1.92 = 0.25*H^3 / (0.5*H^2 + 0.125*H^2)

1.66667 = 0.25*H^3 / (0.625 * H^2)

Now, multiply both sides by (0.625 * H^2):

1.66667 * (0.625 * H^2) = 0.25*H^3

1.04167 * H^2 = 0.25*H^3

Now, divide by 0.25*H^2 to isolate H:

(1.04167 * H^2) / (0.25*H^2) = H

H = 4.16667

Therefore, the height of the riser is approximately 4.17 cm. 

The correct answer is [4.17].
