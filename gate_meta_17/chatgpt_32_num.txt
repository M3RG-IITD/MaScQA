We can calculate the initial rate of heat loss from the top surface of the slab by considering both radiation and convection. 

First, we can calculate the radiation heat transfer using the Stefan-Boltzmann law: 

$Q_r = \epsilon \sigma A (T_s^4 - T_{amb}^4)$ 

where $Q_r$ is the rate of heat transfer by radiation, $\epsilon$ is the emissivity of steel (0.8 in this case), $\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, $A$ is the surface area of the top of the slab, $T_s$ is the surface temperature of the slab (1298 K), and $T_{amb}$ is the ambient temperature (298 K). 

Plugging in the values, we get: 

$Q_r = 0.8 \times 5.7 \times 10^{-8} \times 1 \times 1 \times (1298^4 - 298^4) = 1.78$ KW 

Next, we can calculate the convective heat transfer using the following equation: 

$Q_c = h A (T_s - T_{amb})$ 

where $Q_c$ is the rate of heat transfer by convection, $h$ is the convective heat transfer coefficient (4.6 $W.m^{-2}.K^{-1}$ in this case), and all other variables are the same as before. 

Plugging in the values, we get: 

$Q_c = 4.6 \times 1 \times 1 \times (1298 - 298) = 4608$ W = 4.61 KW 

Finally, we can find the total rate of heat loss by adding the radiation and convection components: 

$Q_{total} = Q_r + Q_c = 1.78 + 4.61 = 6.39$ KW 

Therefore, the initial rate of heat loss from the top surface of the slab by radiation and convection is 6.39 KW.
