To find the ratio of resilience to toughness, we need to calculate both values, given the properties of the material.

1. Resilience: It is the ability of a material to absorb energy when deformed elastically, which can be expressed using the modulus of resilience, defined as the area under the stress-strain curve in the elastic region. For an elastic-plastic material, the stress-strain curve follows Hooke's Law up to the yield point, and then there's a horizontal straight line at the yield stress. Using the given values of E and the yield stress, we can find the yield strain.

Formula: Stress = Young's Modulus * Strain
=> Yield Strain = Yield Stress / Young's Modulus

Yield Strain = 450 MPa / 4.5 GPa
Yield Strain = 450 * 10^6 N/m^2 / 4.5 * 10^9 N/m^2
Yield Strain = 0.1

Now we can calculate the resilience by finding the area under the stress-strain curve, which is a triangle in this case.

Resilience = 0.5 * Yield Stress * Yield Strain

Resilience = 0.5 * 450 MPa * 0.1
Resilience = 0.5 * 450 * 10^6 N/m^2 * 0.1
Resilience = 22.5 * 10^6 J/m^3

2. Toughness: It is the ability of a material to absorb energy and plastically deform without fracturing. The toughness can be expressed as the area under the stress-strain curve up to the fracture point. The shape of this area is a rectangle with a triangle on top of it.

Rectangle Area = Yield Stress * Yield Strain
Triangle Area = 0.5 * (Fracture Strain - Yield Strain) * Yield Stress

Fracture Strain = 0.45
Rectangle Area = 450 MPa * 0.1
Rectangle Area = 450 * 10^6 N/m^2 * 0.1
Rectangle Area = 45 * 10^6 J/m^3

Triangle Area = 0.5 * (0.45 - 0.1) * 450 MPa
Triangle Area = 0.5 * 0.35 * 450 * 10^6 N/m^2
Triangle Area = 78.75 * 10^6 J/m^3

The total toughness is the sum of these two areas.

Toughness = 45 * 10^6 J/m^3 + 78.75 * 10^6 J/m^3
Toughness = 123.75 * 10^6 J/m^3

Now we can find the ratio of resilience to toughness.

Resilience/Toughness = (22.5 * 10^6 J/m^3) / (123.75 * 10^6 J/m^3)
Resilience/Toughness = 22.5 / 123.75
Resilience/Toughness â‰ˆ 0.182

The ratio of resilience to toughness for this material is approximately 0.182 (rounded to three decimal places).

Answer: [0.182]
