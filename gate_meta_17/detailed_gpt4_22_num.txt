To solve this problem, we need to first understand the concepts of wire drawing and power law behavior in materials.

Wire drawing is a process used to reduce the cross-sectional area of a metal wire by pulling it through a series of dies with progressively smaller diameters.

A material exhibiting power law behavior has a stress-strain relationship of the form:

σ = K * ε^n

where σ is the stress, ε is the strain, K is a material constant, and n is the power law exponent.

In this problem, the given power law equation is:

σ = 50 * ε^0.3

Now, we need to find the maximum strain per pass in the annealed condition.

In wire drawing, the maximum strain per pass is related to the drawing stress (σ), initial area (A0), and final area (Af) through the following relationship:

σ = (A0 - Af) / (A0 * ε)

Here, we assume ideal work and efficiency (η = 1), which means the drawing stress is the same as the flow stress of the material.

So, we can write:

50 * ε^0.3 = (A0 - Af) / (A0 * ε)

Now, we need to relate the areas A0 and Af with the strains.

The area reduction in wire drawing is given by:

Af = A0 * (1 - ε)

Substituting this into the above equation for stress, we get:

50 * ε^0.3 = (A0 - A0 * (1 - ε)) / (A0 * ε)

Simplify the equation:

50 * ε^0.3 = A0 * ε / (A0 * ε)

Here, we can cancel A0 and ε from both sides:

50 * ε^0.3 = 1

Now, we need to find the value of ε:

ε^0.3 = 1/50

To find ε, we need to raise both sides to the power of 1/0.3:

ε = (1/50)^(1/0.3)

Using a calculator, we find:

ε ≈ 0.29

So, the maximum strain per pass in the annealed condition is approximately 0.29, or 29%.

The final answer is:

[0.29]
