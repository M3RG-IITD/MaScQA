Since $T_1$<$T_2$, the formation of $AO_2$ is favored at higher temperatures. Therefore, the equilibrium constant $K_p$ for the reaction  A(s) + $O_2$(g) = $AO_2$(s) increases as the temperature increases. 

According to Gibbs-Helmholtz equation, $\Delta G^\circ$ = -RT$\ln K_p$ + $\Delta H^\circ_f$, where $\Delta G^\circ$ is the standard free energy change, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, $\Delta H^\circ_f$ is the standard enthalpy of formation. 

Since $\Delta H^\circ_f$ is a constant, a plot of $\Delta G^\circ$ versus T is just a straight line with a slope of $-\frac{\Delta H^\circ_f}{R}$. 

We can determine the slope using the two temperatures and the known $\Delta H^\circ_f$ for $AO_2$. 

- At temperature less than $T_1$, the reaction is at equilibrium, so $\Delta G^\circ$ = 0. Therefore, 
0 = -RT$\ln K_p$ + $\Delta H^\circ_f$, or $\ln K_p$ = $\frac{\Delta H^\circ_f}{RT}$.
- At the temperature of $T_2$, the reaction is not at equilibrium, so we cannot use this temperature to determine $\Delta H^\circ_f$. However, we know that at $T_2$, $\Delta G^\circ$ = 0 if the reaction were at equilibrium. Therefore, 
0 = -RT$\ln K_{p,T_2}$ + $\Delta H^\circ_f$, or $\ln K_{p,T_2}$ = $\frac{\Delta H^\circ_f}{RT_2}$.

Taking the ratio, we get:
$\frac{\ln K_{p,T_2}}{\ln K_p}$ = $\frac{T}{T_2}$
Since $K_{p,T_2}$<$K_p$ (because the reaction is not at equilibrium at $T_2$), the left side is less than 1, and therefore the right side is less than 1. This means that $T$<$T_2$. 

Therefore, we can conclude that the correct schematic is (A) where the line with negative slope intersects the x-axis to the left of $T_2$.
