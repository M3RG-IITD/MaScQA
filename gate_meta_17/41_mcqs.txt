Pure metals A and B form two real binary solid solutions α and β at temperature T and pressure P. The free energy versus composition plots for both the solutions are shown below. The condition for chemical equilibrium is:
(A) Mole fraction of A in α = mole fraction of A in β amd mole fraction of B in α = mole fraction of B in β (B) Mole fraction of B in α = mole fraction of A in β amd mole fraction of A in α = mole fraction of B in β (C) Activity of A in α = activity of A in β and activity of B in α = activity of B in β (D) Activity of A in α = activity of B in β and activity of B in α = activity of A in β
