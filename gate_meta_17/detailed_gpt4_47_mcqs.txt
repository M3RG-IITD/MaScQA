To solve this problem, we will use the following formula for the electrical conductivity of a semiconductor at room temperature:

$$
σ = q(n_pμ_p + n_eμ_e)
$$

where:
- σ is the electrical conductivity ($10^(-6)Ω^(-1).m^(-1)$ in this case),
- q is the elementary charge (1.6 x $10^{-19} C$),
- $n_p$ and $n_e$ are the hole and electron concentrations, which are equal in an intrinsic semiconductor (we denote them as n),
- $μ_p$ and $μ_e$ are the hole and electron mobilities (0.75 and 0.06 $m^(2)V^(-1)s^(-1)$, respectively).

Since we are considering an intrinsic semiconductor, we have $n_p = n_e = n$. Therefore, we can rewrite the formula as:

$$
σ = qn(μ_p + μ_e)
$$

We want to find the intrinsic carrier concentration n at room temperature. Rearrange the equation to solve for n:

$$
n = \frac{σ}{q(μ_p + μ_e)}
$$

Now substitute the given values into the equation:

$$
n = \frac{10^{-6}Ω^{-1}.m^{-1}}{1.6 × 10^{-19} C (0.75 m^2V^{-1}s^{-1} + 0.06 m^2V^{-1}s^{-1})}
$$

First, calculate the sum inside the parenthesis:

$$
0.75 + 0.06 = 0.81
$$

Now, substitute the sum into the equation:

$$
n = \frac{10^{-6}}{1.6 × 10^{-19} × 0.81}
$$

Next, perform the division:

$$
n \approx \frac{1}{1.6 × 0.81 × 10^{13}}
$$

$$
n \approx \frac{1}{1.296 × 10^{13}}
$$

Finally, calculate the value of n:

$$
n \approx 7.7 × 10^{12}
$$

So, the intrinsic carrier concentration at room temperature for the given semiconductor is approximately 7.7 x $10^{12}$ per $m^3$.

Hence, the correct answer is (B) 7.7 * $10^{12}$.
