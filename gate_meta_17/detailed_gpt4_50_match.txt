To solve this problem, we need to understand the concepts of dislocations, slip planes, and their interactions. Dislocations are line defects in a crystalline material that enable slip (plastic deformation). They can be characterized by their Burgers vector (b), which determines the magnitude and direction of the dislocation movement during slip.

Edge dislocations have Burgers vectors perpendicular to their dislocation line direction. When two edge dislocations with Burgers vectors of the same magnitude are present on parallel slip planes, their interaction depends on the relative orientation of their Burgers vectors. To determine the interaction between the dislocations in each configuration, we will analyze their forces and stress fields.

Configuration [P]:

In this configuration, the dislocations are aligned such that their Burgers vectors are pointing in opposite directions on the same slip plane. This means that the stress fields generated by each dislocation are opposite in direction and will cancel each other out. As a result, the dislocations are in stable equilibrium (3).

Configuration [Q]:

Here, the dislocations have Burgers vectors pointing in the same direction on parallel slip planes. This leads to the stress fields generated by each dislocation adding constructively, causing an attractive force between the dislocations (2).

Configuration [R]:

In this configuration, the dislocations have Burgers vectors pointing in opposite directions on parallel slip planes. This results in the stress fields generated by each dislocation adding constructively, causing a repulsive force between the dislocations (1).

Configuration [S]:

Finally, in this configuration, the dislocations are aligned with Burgers vectors pointing in the same direction on the same slip plane. The stress fields generated by each dislocation are opposite in direction and will cancel each other out. However, unlike Configuration [P], a small perturbation to either dislocation will cause them to move in opposite directions, ultimately resulting in an unstable equilibrium (4).

So, the correct matching is: P-3, Q-2, R-1, S-4, and the correct answer is:

(A) P-3, Q-2, R-4, S-1
