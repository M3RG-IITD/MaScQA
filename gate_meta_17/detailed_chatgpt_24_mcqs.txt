The manufacturing technique used for making window glass is the Float-bath method.

Explanation:

(A) Investment casting: This is a manufacturing technique used for making complex metal parts with fine details. It is not used for making window glass.

(B) Patenting: This is a heat treatment process used for improving the mechanical properties of steel wires. It is not used for making window glass.

(C) Spray forming: This manufacturing technique is used for making complex metal components with high strength and durability. It is not used for making window glass.

(D) Float-bath method: This is the most common manufacturing technique used for making window glass. In this process, molten glass is floated onto a bath of molten tin, which creates a smooth and flat surface. The glass is then cooled and cut into desired sizes and shapes.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Float-bath method.
