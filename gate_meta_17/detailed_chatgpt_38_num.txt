First, we can write out the balanced equation for the combustion of CO with oxygen:

$2CO + O_2 → 2CO_2$

We are given that we have a stoichiometric mixture of CO and oxygen, which means we have the exact amount of oxygen needed to completely react with the CO. Therefore, we can assume that the molar flow rate of oxygen entering the reactor is also $1kg-mol.h^(-1)$.

To find the adiabatic flame temperature, we can use the equation:

$ΔH_{combustion} = -C_p(T_{ad} - T_{in})$

where $ΔH_{combustion}$ is the heat of combustion per unit of CO, $C_p$ is the heat capacity of $CO_2$, $T_{ad}$ is the adiabatic flame temperature, and $T_{in}$ is the initial temperature of the gases (in this case, 25°C).

We can calculate $ΔH_{combustion}$ by using the given heat of formation of $CO_2$ and $CO$:

$ΔH_{combustion} = ΔH°(CO) + 2ΔH°(CO_2) - ΔH°(O_2)$

$ΔH_{combustion} = -110.53 kJ$

Note that we use the negative of the heat of formation of $CO$ because we are combusting it to form $CO_2$.

Therefore, we can write:

$-110.53 = -44(T_{ad} - 298)$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$T_{ad} \approx 2239.84 K$

Rounding to two decimal places, the adiabatic flame temperature is:

$T_{ad} = 2239.84 K$

Therefore, the answer is:

- 2239.84 K
