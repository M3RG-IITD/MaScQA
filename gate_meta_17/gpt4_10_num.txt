We are given the following:

Green density = 0.55
Final density after sintering = 0.865

Now, we need to find the linear shrinkage (LS) in percentage.
We know that volume shrinkage (VS) is related to linear shrinkage as follows:

VS = 1 - (1 - LS)^3

Since the shrinkage is uniform, the volume shrinkage is equal to the ratio of final density to green density:

VS = Final_density / Green_density = 0.865 / 0.55 = 1.5727

Now we can find LS using the formula:

1 - (1 - LS)^3 = 1.5727
(1 - LS)^3 = 1 - 1.5727 = -0.5727

Take the cube root of both sides:

1 - LS = (-0.5727)^(1/3)
1 - LS = -0.8324

Now, solve for LS:

LS = 1 - (-0.8324) = 1.8324

Convert LS to percentage by multiplying by 100:

LS (%) = 1.8324 * 100 = 183.24

Therefore, the linear shrinkage is [183.24]%.
