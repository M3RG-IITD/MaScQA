A steel component is subjected to fatigue loading: σ(maximum) = 200 Mpa, σ (minimum) = 0. The component has an initial crack length of 1mm. Propogation of crack is governmed by da/dN = $10^(-12)$ $(ΔK)^3$, where, the crack length a is in meters, N is the number of cycles and ΔK is in $MPa.m^(1/2)$. The length of the crack (in m) after one million cycles will be?(answer up to three decimal places).
