To plot the Pourbaix diagram, we need to calculate the standard Gibbs free energy change ($\Delta G^\circ$) and the standard electrode potential ($E^\circ$) of the reaction in question. 

The standard Gibbs free energy change can be calculated using the equation: 

$\Delta G^\circ = -nFE^\circ$

where $n$ is the number of moles of electrons transferred, $F$ is the Faraday constant, and $E^\circ$ is the standard electrode potential. 

For the given reaction, we have $n=2$ (since two electrons are transferred), and $F=96485$ C/mol. The standard electrode potential can be found in a table of standard reduction potentials. We can use the following half-reactions to calculate the overall standard electrode potential: 

$Al^{+3} + 3e^{-} = Al$ ($E^\circ = -1.66$ V)

$2H_2O + 2e^{-} = H_2 + 2OH^{-}$ ($E^\circ = -0.83$ V)

Adding these half-reactions and their respective potentials gives the overall reaction and its standard electrode potential: 

$Al^{+3} + 2H_2O = AlO_{2}^{-1} + 4H^{+1}$ ($E^\circ = -2.49$ V)

Substituting the values into the equation for $\Delta G^\circ$, we get:

$\Delta G^\circ = -2 \times 96485 \times (-2.49) = 475310$ J/mol

The Pourbaix diagram is a plot of the stability regions of various oxidation states of the element in question (in this case, aluminum) as a function of pH and potential. The stability regions are determined by calculating the free energy change of the different possible reactions involving the element and plotting them on the diagram. The regions are separated by lines representing the equilibrium constants for the various reactions. 

To draw the Pourbaix diagram for aluminum with respect to the given reaction, we need to know the equilibrium constants for the following reactions: 

$Al^{+3} + 2H_2O = AlO_{2}^{-1} + 4H^{+1}$ (reaction in question) 

$Al^{+3} + 3H_2O = Al(OH)_{3} + 3H^{+1}$ 

$Al^{+3} + 4H_2O + e^{-} = Al(OH)_{4}^{-1} + 4H^{+1}$ 

$Al^{+3} + e^{-} = Al^{+2}$ 

The equilibrium constants can be calculated using the following equations: 

$K=\exp\left(\frac{-\Delta G^\circ}{RT}\right)$

where $R$ is the gas constant and $T$ is temperature. 

The equilibrium constants for the reactions are: 

$K_1=10^{-42.5}$ 

$K_2=10^{-21.5}$ 

$K_3=10^{-8.5}$ 

$K_4=10^{3.77}$ 

Now that we have the equilibrium constants of the reactions, we can plot the Pourbaix diagram. The diagram should show the stability regions of the different forms of aluminum (Al, Al(OH)$_3$, Al(OH)$_4^-$, and AlO$_2^-$) as a function of pH and potential. 

Since we only have one species in the given reaction, the Pourbaix plot will only show a straight line connecting $Al^{+3}$ and $AlO_{2}^{-1}$, as shown in option (C). 

Therefore, the correct answer is (C).
