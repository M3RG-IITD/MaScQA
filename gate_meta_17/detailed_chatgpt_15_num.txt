To estimate the volume fraction of α phase, we need to use the grid superimposed on the microstructure. We can count the number of grid points that intersect with the α phase particles and divide that by the total number of grid points.

Counting the grid points, we find that there are a total of 45 points that intersect with the α phase particles.

Counting the total number of grid points, we find that there are a total of 100 points.

Therefore, the estimated volume fraction of α phase is:

45/100 = 0.450

Rounded to three decimal places, the answer is:

[0.450]
