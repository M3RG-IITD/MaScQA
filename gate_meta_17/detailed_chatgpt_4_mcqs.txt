We know, for isothermal process temperature remains constant. Therefore, the temperature of the system is constant for all the three isothermal curves shown in the diagram. 

Also, we know that the equation for isothermal process PV = constant. 

Let us consider a starting point A on the largest isothermal curve, which has the highest volume and the smallest pressure. At point A, the pressure is P3 and the volume is V3. 

Next, we move from point A to point B on the same curve. At point B, the pressure is P2 and the volume is V2. 

From the ideal gas equation PV=nRT, we can say that the pressure is inversely proportional to volume, that is, P1V1 = P2V2. Therefore, since P3 > P2,  V3 < V2. 

Now, let's consider the second isothermal curve, which has lower volume and higher pressure than the first curve. 

We start at point C on this curve, where the pressure is P2 and the volume is V2. Then we move to point D on the same curve where the pressure is P1 and the volume is V1. 

Again, from the ideal gas equation PV=nRT, we can say that P2V2 = P1V1. Therefore, since P2 > P1, V2 < V1. 

Lastly, we consider the smallest curve of the three, where the pressure is the highest and the volume is the least. 

We start at point E on this curve, where the pressure is P1 and the volume is V1. Then we move to point F on the same curve where the pressure is P3 and the volume is V3. 

Using the same equation PV=constant, we can say that P1V1 = P3V3. Therefore, since P3 > P1, V3 < V1. 

Thus, we can order the temperatures of the isothermal curves as follows: T3 > T1 > T2 

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) T3 > T1 > T2.
