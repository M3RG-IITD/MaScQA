To find the concentration of carbon in steel (c) at t = 1 min, we can solve the given differential equation.

The differential equation is: dC/dt = -(c - c*)

We can separate the variables and rewrite it as: dC/(c - c*) = -dt

Now, we can integrate both sides. Since c* = 0.04 wt.% and c( t = 0 min) = 0.4 wt.%:

∫(dc/(c - 0.04)) = ∫-dt, from c = 0.4 to c(t) and t = 0 to t = 1.

Using the substitution method with u = c - 0.04:

∫(du/u) = ∫-dt, from u = 0.36 to u(t) and t = 0 to t = 1.

Now, we can integrate both sides:

[ln(u)] from 0.36 to u(t) = -[t] from 0 to 1

ln(u(t)) - ln(0.36) = -1

ln(u(t)/0.36) = -1

To isolate u(t), we can use the property of logarithms, a = ln(b) => b = e^a:

u(t) / 0.36 = e^(-1)

u(t) = 0.36 * e^(-1)

Recall that u = c - 0.04, so we can substitute back and find c(t):

c(t) - 0.04 = 0.36 * e^(-1)

c(t) = 0.36 * e^(-1) + 0.04

Now, we can plug in the values and evaluate c(t) at t = 1 min.

c(1) = 0.36 * e^(-1) + 0.04 ≈ 0.132

Thus, the concentration of carbon in steel (in wt.%) at t = 1 min is approximately 0.132 wt.%.

Answer: [0.132]
