Unfortunately, I cannot see the image or the superimposed grid that you are referring to. To estimate the volume fraction of the α phase using a grid, you can follow these steps:

1. Count the total number of grid points: Count all the points where the grid intersects. Take this number as T.

2. Count the number of points that lie inside the α phase particles: Look at the intersections of the grid and identify which points are within (or on the boundary of) the α phase particles. Take this number as A.

3. Calculate the volume fraction: Since we're using a two-dimensional representation, we're effectively calculating an area fraction. To estimate the volume fraction of the α phase, divide the number of points within the α phase particles (A) by the total number of points (T):

   Volume fraction of α phase = A / T

4. Convert to decimal: To express the result as a decimal with three decimal places, divide the resulting fraction, and round to the third decimal place.

Without the image or grid details, I cannot compute the correct answer. But once you have T and A, you can apply the method above to find the volume fraction of the α phase. Put the final answer inside a list like this:

[0.xxx]  (Replace xxx with the correct volume fraction up to three decimal places)
