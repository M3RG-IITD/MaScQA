Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. First, we need to understand what a Frank-Read source is. A Frank-Read source describes a mechanism for the generation of dislocations in crystalline materials like metals, under mechanical load. It is a loop of dislocation line driven by the stress acting upon it.

2. The stress required to operate a Frank-Read source is the stress needed to maintain the dislocation line's length, causing it to expand and create more dislocations.

3. We are given four options to choose from, and we need to find out which formula gives the stress required to operate a Frank-Read source of length L. The options involve the following variables:
   - G: Shear modulus (a property of the material),
   - b: Burgers vector (magnitude of the lattice distortion),
   - L: Length of the Frank-Read source.

4. The stress required to operate a Frank-Read source is based on the balance between the line tension of the dislocation loop, which tends to decrease the loop size, and the external stress, which tends to increase the loop size.

5. The line tension for a dislocation is given by T = Gb^2, and the force required to balance the line tension is F = TL (where T is the line tension and L is the length of the dislocation line).

6. Stress is defined as force per unit area, which in this case is F, and the area we are considering here is the cross-sectional area of the dislocation loop, given by A = L^2. 

7. Therefore, the stress required to operate a Frank-Read source is:

sigma = F / A

8. Substituting F = TL and A = L^2, we get:

sigma = (Gb^2 * L) / L^2

9. Simplifying the expression, we have:

sigma = Gb^2 / L

10. Comparing this expression with the given options, we have a match with option (B).

Thus, the correct answer is:

[B] Gb^2 / L
