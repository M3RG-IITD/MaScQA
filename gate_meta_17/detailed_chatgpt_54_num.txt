The angle of bite is the angle between the tangent to the roll and the direction of motion of the slab.

Let's first find the arc length of contact between the roll and the slab:
 
s = θr
where s is the arc length, θ is the angle of bite in radians, and r is the radius of the roll.

s = (10°)(450 mm)
s = 78.54 mm

This means that during rolling, a length of 78.54 mm of the slab is in contact with the roll at any given time.

To find the maximum possible reduction, we need to consider the thickness reduction in each pass of the rolling process. A general formula for thickness reduction is:

Δt = (Ao - At)/Ao
where Δt is the thickness reduction, Ao is the original thickness of the slab, and At is the final thickness after rolling.

In this case, we want to find the maximum possible reduction, which means we want Δt to be as large as possible. To achieve this, we need to roll the slab until its thickness is reduced as much as possible in each pass. This is called the maximum possible draft, and it occurs when the thickness reduction is equal across the entire width of the slab.

The maximum possible draft can be calculated using the following formula:

Dmax = 0.5s(1 - μ^2)/ln(Ao/At)
where Dmax is the maximum possible draft (or reduction), μ is the coefficient of friction between the roll and the slab, and ln is the natural logarithm.

The coefficient of friction depends on the materials in contact and the surface finish of the roll. Let's assume a value of 0.3 for μ, which is typical for nickel alloys and smooth rolls. 

Using the given values for s, Ao (250 mm), and μ, we can solve for Dmax:

Dmax = 0.5(78.54 mm)(1 - 0.3^2)/ln(250 mm/At)
Dmax = 35.29/ln(250/At)

Now, we need to find the final thickness of the slab after rolling. This depends on the number of passes and the amount of thickness reduction in each pass. Let's assume we do 10 passes, with equal reduction in each pass:

Δt = (Ao - At)/Ao
0.1 = (250 - At)/250
At = 225 mm

So, after 10 passes, the final thickness of the slab will be 225 mm.

Now, we can calculate the actual thickness reduction in each pass, using:

Δt = (Ao - At)/Ao
Δt = (250 - 225)/250
Δt = 0.1

The thickness reduction in each pass is 0.1, or 10% of the original thickness.

To find the maximum possible reduction over the 10 passes, we can use the following formula:

Dtotal = (1 - Δt)^n * Ao
where Dtotal is the total reduction over n passes, and Ao is the original thickness of the slab.

Dtotal = (1 - 0.1)^10 * 250
Dtotal = 57.67 mm

Therefore, the maximum possible reduction in thickness during rolling is 57.67 mm (rounded to two decimal places).
