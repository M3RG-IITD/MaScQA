The specific energy consumption can be calculated using the following formula:

Specific energy consumption = (voltage × current × 3600) / (cathodic current efficiency × 65)

where:

- voltage = 3.5V
- current = 400A
- cathodic current efficiency = 90%
- 65 = atomic weight of Zn
- 3600 = conversion factor from hours to seconds (since current is given in amperes and not milliamperes)

Substituting the given values, we get:

Specific energy consumption = (3.5 × 400 × 3600) / (0.9 × 65)
Specific energy consumption = 113934.46 kJ/kg (rounded to two decimal places)

Therefore, the specific energy consumption is 113934.46 kJ/kg (answer up to two decimal places).
