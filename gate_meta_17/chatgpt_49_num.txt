The equation to calculate the transformation during recrystallization is given by:

X = 1 - exp[-k(t^n)]

Where:
X = Fraction transformed
t = Time
k = Rate constant
n = Avrami exponent

We are given that n = 2, X = 0.2 (20% complete), and t = 100s. Therefore, we can rearrange the equation to solve for k:

k = -ln[1 - X^(1/n)] / t

k = -ln[1 - 0.2^(1/2)] / 100

k = 0.00395 s^-1

Now we can use this value of k to calculate the transformation at 400s:

X = 1 - exp[-k(t^n)]

X = 1 - exp[-0.00395*(400^2)]

X = 0.977 or 97.7% (rounded to two decimal places)

Therefore, the transformation (in %) in 400s is 97.7%.

Answer: [97.7%]
