We are given the following information:

1. Initial thickness (h0) of the nickel-alloy slab = 250 mm
2. Diameter of the rolling roll (D) = 450 mm
3. Angle of bite (α) = 10°

We need to calculate the maximum possible reduction (Δh) in the thickness of the slab during the rolling process.

To do this, first, we need to determine the neutral point or the point at which there is no relative motion between the workpiece and the roll. This neutral point corresponds to the point where the radius of the roll (R) intersects a line that bisects the angle of bite (α/2). We can call this bisecting line OB and the neutral point N. 

To find the length of the line segments ON and NB, we can use trigonometry, since the angle of bite and the radius of the roll are given.

Consider the triangle ONB:
- The angle NOB = α/2 = 10°/2 = 5°
- The length of the hypotenuse OB = R = 450 mm / 2 = 225 mm (since R = D / 2)

Now, we can find ON and NB using the sine and cosine of the angle NOB:

ON = R × sin5° = 225 × sin5° ≈ 225 × 0.08716 ≈ 19.61 mm
NB = R × cos5° = 225 × cos5° ≈ 225 × 0.99620 ≈ 224.15 mm

The thickness of the slab after rolling (h1) is equal to the sum of the lengths ON and NB:

h1 = ON + NB = 19.61 + 224.15 ≈ 243.76 mm

Finally, we can calculate the maximum possible reduction (Δh) in the slab's thickness by subtracting the final thickness (h1) from the initial thickness (h0):

Δh = h0 - h1 = 250 - 243.76 ≈ 6.24 mm

So, the maximum possible reduction in the slab's thickness during the rolling process is approximately 6.24 mm.

The correct answer is [6.24].
