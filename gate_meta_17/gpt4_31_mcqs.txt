Since we are looking for the standard free energy change (ΔG°) versus temperature plot for the given reaction in equilibrium, we should consider the following formula:

ΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS°

Here, ΔH° is the change in enthalpy and ΔS° is the change in entropy.

Since the reaction forms a solid oxide (AO2) from a metal (A) and gaseous oxygen (O2), this means that the oxide is more stable at high temperatures (as mentioned T1 < T2). Therefore, the reaction will be more spontaneous (negative ΔG°) at higher temperatures.

Looking at the formula, as we increase the temperature, TΔS° will become larger. Considering the reaction, the formation of the solid oxide from a metal and gaseous oxygen will have a negative ΔS° (reduced entropy). Therefore, TΔS° will be positive, and its magnitude will increase with increasing temperature.

As the temperature increases, the standard free energy change ΔG° will become more negative since ΔH° remains constant and TΔS° increases, eventually crossing the ΔG° = 0 line when T > T1. This means that the correct graphical representation of the ΔG° versus temperature plot will be a straight line with a positive slope that passes through the point where ΔG° = 0 for T = T1.

Therefore, the correct answer is option (B). 

The correct answer is in the list: [(B)]
