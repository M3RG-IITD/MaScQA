Assuming thermodynamic equilibrium, the following equation holds true:
$\Delta G = -RT\ln(Q)$

where
$\Delta G$ is the change in Gibbs free energy,
$R$ is the gas constant,
$T$ is the temperature, and
$Q$ is the reaction quotient.

At thermodynamic equilibrium, $\Delta G = 0$, so:

$0 = -RT\ln(Q)$

$ln(Q) = 0$

$Q = 1$

For the given reaction, the reaction quotient is:

$Q = \frac{(P_{CO_2})}{(P_{CO_2}^{^\circ})}$

where
$P_{CO_2}$ is the partial pressure of $CO_2$,
$P_{CO_2}^{^\circ}$ is the standard partial pressure of $CO_2$.

Since the system is closed, the total number of moles of gas remains constant. Therefore, the sum of the partial pressures of all gases in the system remains constant. At equilibrium, the partial pressure of $CO_2$ is related to the partial pressure of $O_2$ (from the air present in the closed system) as follows:

$P_{CO_2} + P_{O_2} = P_{total}$

where $P_{total}$ is the total pressure in the system.

Since the total number of moles of gas in the system remains constant, at equilibrium, the degree of freedom F is 1, given by the partial pressure of $CO_2$ (or $O_2$).
