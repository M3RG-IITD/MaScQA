In an FCC (face-centered cubic) crystal, the coordination number is 12 and there are tetrahedral voids between the close-packed planes. 

To determine the radius of the largest sphere that can fit in a tetrahedral void, we can use the formula:

Radius of sphere = (Radius of tetrahedron/2) * (sqrt(2)-1)

where the radius of the tetrahedron is given by:

Radius of tetrahedron = sqrt(3) * lattice parameter/4

Substituting the given lattice parameter of 0.401 nm, we get:

Radius of tetrahedron = sqrt(3) * 0.401 nm/4 = 0.104 nm

Substituting this value in the formula for the radius of the sphere, we get:

Radius of sphere = (0.104/2) * (sqrt(2)-1) = 0.039 nm

Therefore, the radius of the largest sphere that can fit in the tetrahedral void of an FCC metal with lattice parameter 0.401 nm is 0.039 nm (up to three decimal places).

Answer: [0.039]
