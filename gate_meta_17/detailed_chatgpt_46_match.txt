As we'll have to match the magnetic moments of neighboring atoms in Group-I with the corresponding magnetic material in Group-II, we first need to understand what the table is showing us. 

Group-I lists four different types of lattices: simple cube, body-centered cube, face-centered cube, and hexagonal close-packed. For each of these lattices, the table lists the number of atoms in the unit cell (N), the number of nearest neighbors per atom (n), the formula for the coordination number (CN), and the formula for the packing factor (PF). 

Group-II lists four different magnetic materials: diamagnetic, paramagnetic, ferromagnetic, and antiferromagnetic. For each of these materials, the table lists the behavior of the magnetic moment in an external magnetic field. 

To match the magnetic moment of neighboring atoms in a one-dimensional lattice in Group-I to the corresponding magnetic material in Group-II, we need to consider the number of neighboring atoms and the type of magnetic behavior that is associated with that number. 

A one-dimensional lattice can be thought of as a chain of atoms in a line. Each atom has two neighbors: one to the left and one to the right. Therefore, we can eliminate any magnetic materials from Group-II that have a different number of neighbors. 

Diamagnetic materials are not affected by an external magnetic field, so we can eliminate them as well. 

Paramagnetic materials are weakly attracted to an external magnetic field, so they could be a possibility. 

Ferromagnetic materials are strongly attracted to an external magnetic field and can form permanent magnets, so they could also be a possibility. 

Antiferromagnetic materials have a more complicated behavior, where neighboring atoms have opposite magnetic moments that cancel each other out. While this type of material could also be a possibility for a one-dimensional lattice, it seems unlikely as it would require a lot of fine-tuning to get the magnetic moments of the neighboring atoms to cancel each other out perfectly. 

Using this reasoning, we can eliminate options (B) and (D) since they have diamagnetic materials as a possibility. 

Option (A) has ferromagnetic material as the possibility for lattice R, but this is not correct. Ferromagnetic materials have a strong attraction to an external magnetic field, but in a one-dimensional lattice, the neighboring atoms would be attracted in the same direction and would not cancel each other out, making this a highly unstable configuration. Therefore, we can also eliminate option (A). 

This leaves us with option (C), which has paramagnetic and ferromagnetic materials as the possibilities for the different lattices. Let's check whether this makes sense for each lattice: 

- Lattice P: There are two neighbors per atom, so both paramagnetic and ferromagnetic materials are possible. 
- Lattice Q: There are four neighbors per atom, so paramagnetic materials are possible, but ferromagnetic materials are not. Again, neighboring atoms would be attracted in the same direction and would not cancel each other out. 
- Lattice R: There are twelve neighbors per atom, so paramagnetic materials are not possible. However, ferromagnetic materials are possible because the magnetic moments can be aligned in the same direction across multiple atoms, making this a stable configuration. 
- Lattice S: There are six neighbors per atom, so both paramagnetic and ferromagnetic materials are possible. 

Therefore, the correct option is (C) P-2; Q-4; R-1; S-3: 

P - Simple cube - 2 neighbors/atom - paramagnetic and ferromagnetic materials possible 
Q - Body-centered cube - 4 neighbors/atom - paramagnetic materials possible 
R - Face-centered cube - 12 neighbors/atom - ferromagnetic materials possible 
S - Hexagonal close-packed - 6 neighbors/atom - paramagnetic and ferromagnetic materials possible
