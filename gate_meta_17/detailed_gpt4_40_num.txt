We are given the following information:

- Atomic weight of Zn = 65
- Current = 400 A
- Voltage = 3.5 V
- Cathodic current efficiency = 90%

We are asked to find the specific energy consumption in $kJ.kg^(-1) zinc$. 

First, let's calculate the total energy consumption in the cell. Energy consumption can be calculated using the formula:

Energy (W) = Voltage (V) x Current (I)

The energy consumption of the zinc electrowinning cell is:

W = 3.5 V × 400 A = 1400 W

Now, we need to convert this to $kJ.s^(-1)$. 

1 W = 1 J/s, so:

1400 W = 1400 J/s

To convert this to kJ:

1400 J/s * (1 kJ / 1000 J) = 1.4 kJ/s

Next, let's determine the rate at which zinc is deposited. The cathodic current efficiency tells us the percentage of the total current that is being used to deposit zinc. Since the efficiency is 90%, this means that 90% of the 400 A current is being used for the deposition of zinc. 

Effective current = (90/100) × 400 A = 360 A

The rate of zinc deposition can be calculated using Faraday's law of electrolysis, which states:

m = (I × t × M) / (n × F)

Where:
- m: mass of zinc deposited (kg)
- I: effective current (A)
- t: time (s)
- M: molar mass of zinc (g/mol)
- n: number of moles of electrons required to deposit one mole of Zn
- F: Faraday's constant (96485 C/mol)

For zinc (Zn), n = 2 since the process involves Zn²⁺ ions:

Zn²⁺ + 2e⁻ -> Zn

So, we have:

m = (360 A × t × 65 g/mol) / (2 × 96485 C/mol)

Now we want to express the rate of zinc deposition in terms of kg/s. To convert the molar mass of Zn to kg:

65 g/mol × (1 kg / 1000 g) = 0.065 kg/mol

So the rate of zinc deposition (in kg/s) is:

m/t = (360 A × 0.065 kg/mol) / (2 × 96485 C/mol)

m/t = 23.4 kg / (193970 C)

Now we can find the specific energy consumption, which is defined as the energy consumption per unit mass of zinc deposited. This can be calculated by dividing the energy consumption by the rate of zinc deposition:

Specific Energy Consumption = (1.4 kJ/s) / (23.4 kg / 193970 C)

To simplify this expression, we first calculate (23.4 kg / 193970 C):

23.4 kg / 193970 C = 1.2 × 10^(-4) kg/C

Now, we divide 1.4 kJ/s by 1.2 × 10^(-4) kg/C:

Specific Energy Consumption = 1.4 kJ/s / 1.2 × 10^(-4) kg/C

Specific Energy Consumption ≈ 11667 kJ/C

Since we are looking for the specific energy consumption in $kJ.kg^(-1) zinc$, we want the unit to be kJ/kg. Since 1 C = 1 A × 1 s, we have:

Specific Energy Consumption ≈ 11667 kJ/(A × s × kg)

Now we multiply by the effective current (360 A) to get the result in kJ/kg:

Specific Energy Consumption ≈ 11667 kJ/(A × s × kg) × 360 A

Specific Energy Consumption ≈ 4200.12 kJ/kg

So, the specific energy consumption of the zinc electrowinning cell is approximately 4200.12 kJ/kg of zinc (rounded to two decimal places).
