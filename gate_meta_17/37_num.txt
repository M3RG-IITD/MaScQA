In primary steelmaking, dissolved oxygen(O) reacts with carbon (C) to produce CO(g), at 1atm pressure according to the reaction: C + O = CO(g). The equilibrium constant for this reaction is: logK = (1160/T) + 2.003, where T is in Kelvin. Assuming Henrian activity coefficient of both O and C to be unity, the dissolved oxygen content (in wt.%) of a plain carbon steel melt with 0.7 wt.% C at 1600Â° C is?(answer up tp four decimal places)
