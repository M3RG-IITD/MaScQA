Given values:
Ambient temperature (T_a) = 298 K
Emissivity of steel (ε) = 0.8
Convective heat transfer coefficient (h) = 4.6 W/m²·K
Stefan- Boltzmann constant (σ) = 5.7e-8 W/m²·K^4
Temperature of the slab (T_s) = 1298 K
Area of top surface of slab (A) = 1 m x 1 m = 1 m²

We need to calculate the initial rate of heat loss from the top surface of the slab due to radiation and convection.

1. Heat loss due to radiation:
The formula for heat loss due to radiation is given by:
Q_rad = ε * σ * A * (T_s^4 - T_a^4)

Substitute the values, we get,
Q_rad = 0.8 * 5.7e-8 * 1 * (1298^4 - 298^4)
Q_rad = 0.8 * 5.7e-8 * 1 * (2838539664 - 7890481)
Q_rad = 0.8 * 5.7e-8 * (2830659183)
Q_rad ≈ 1293.02 W

2. Heat loss due to convection:
The formula for heat loss due to convection is given by:
Q_conv = h * A * (T_s - T_a)

Substitute the values, we get,
Q_conv = 4.6 * 1 * (1298 - 298)
Q_conv = 4.6 * 1000
Q_conv = 4600 W

Total heat loss from the top surface of slab by radiation and convection:
Q_total = Q_rad + Q_conv
Q_total = 1293.02 W + 4600 W
Q_total = 5893.02 W

As it's asked in KW, we need to convert the total heat loss to KW:
Q_total = 5893.02 W * (1 kW / 1000 W)
Q_total ≈ 5.89 kW

Answer: The initial rate of heat loss from the top surface of the slab by radiation and convection is [5.89] kW (up to two decimal places).
