To solve this problem, we need to use the Avrami equation which is used to describe the kinetics of phase transformation in materials science. The Avrami equation is given as:

X(t) = 1 - exp(-Kt^n)

Here, X(t) denotes the fraction of transformed material at time t, K is the Avrami rate constant, and n is the Avrami exponent.

Given that the Avrami exponent n = 2 and that 20% (0.20) recrystallization is completed after 100 seconds. Now, we can proceed to find the Avrami rate constant K.

Step 1: Using the given information to solve for K:

X(t) = 0.20 = 1 - exp(-K * (100^2))
0.80 = exp(-K * 10000)

Step 2: Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(0.80) = -10000K

Step 3: Solve for K:

K = - ln(0.80) / 10000 ≈ 2.52573e-5

Now that we have found the Avrami rate constant, we can use it to calculate the transformation percentage after 400 seconds.

Step 4: Calculate the transformation percentage using the Avrami equation:

X(t) = 1 - exp(-K * (400^2))
X(t) = 1 - exp(-(2.52573e-5) * (160000))

Step 5: Evaluate the expression:

X(t) ≈ 1 - exp(-4.04053)
X(t) ≈ 1 - 0.01743
X(t) ≈ 0.98257

Step 6: Convert the fraction to a percentage:

Transformation percentage ≈ 0.98257 * 100 ≈ 98.26%

Answer: The transformation percentage after 400 seconds is approximately [98.26%].
