The predicted average neck size can be calculated using the following equation:

$d = \left(\frac{3\gamma_{wt}}{\pi \Delta T} \right)^{0.5} \left(\frac{\gamma_{int}}{\gamma_{wn}}\right)^{0.25}$

Where:
$d$ = average neck size
$\gamma_{wt}$ = tungsten surface energy
$\Delta T$ = temperature difference between sintering temperature and nickel melting temperature
$\gamma_{int}$ = interfacial energy between grains of different materials
$\gamma_{wn}$ = interfacial energy between tungsten grains

Substituting the given values:

$d = \left(\frac{3\times0.52}{\pi\times(3410-1500)} \right)^{0.5} \left(\frac{0.30}{0.52}\right)^{0.25} \times 40$

$d = 20$ µm

Therefore, the predicted average neck size of sintered tungsten grain is (C) 20 µm. 

Answer: (C) 20
