We can use the relationship between strain and Poisson's ratio to determine the lateral strain, and then use the definition of volumetric strain to find the answer.

Let the applied stress be σ and the resulting strain be ε. We are given that ε = 0.02. The Poisson's ratio ν is also given as 0.3. 

From the definition of Poisson's ratio:

ν = lateral strain / longitudinal strain

The longitudinal strain is the same as the axial strain in uniaxial stress, which is ε = 0.02. Thus, we can solve for the lateral strain:

lateral strain = ν * longitudinal strain
               = 0.3 * 0.02
               = 0.006

The volumetric strain ε_v is defined as the change in volume per unit volume:

ε_v = (change in volume) / (original volume)

In terms of the axial and lateral strains:

ε_v = ε + 2*lateral strain

Substituting the given values:

ε_v = 0.02 + 2*0.006
     = 0.032 (rounded to three decimal places)

Therefore, the volumetric strain is 0.032. 

Answer: [0.032]
