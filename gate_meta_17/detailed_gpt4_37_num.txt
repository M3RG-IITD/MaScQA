We are given the reaction: 
C + O = CO(g)

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is:
logK = (1160/T) + 2.003, where T is in Kelvin.

We are asked to find the dissolved oxygen content (in wt.%) of a plain carbon steel melt with 0.7 wt.% C at 1600° C, assuming Henrian activity coefficient of both O and C to be unity.

Step 1: Convert the temperature to Kelvin
T = 1600°C = 1600 + 273.15 = 1873.15 K

Step 2: Calculate the equilibrium constant K
logK = (1160 / 1873.15) + 2.003
logK = 0.6188 + 2.003
logK = 2.6218

Now, find the equilibrium constant K by taking the antilog of logK:
K = 10^2.6218 ≈ 420.49

Step 3: Write the equilibrium expression
K = [CO(g)] / ([C] * [O])

Since we're given that the Henrian activity coefficient of both O and C are unity, we can simply use concentrations instead of activities in our equilibrium expression:
420.49 = [CO(g)] / ([C] * [O])

Step 4: Use wt.% C to find [C] and [O]
We know that the total carbon content in the steel is 0.7 wt.%. Let x represent the dissolved oxygen content (in wt.%), which we're trying to find. 

Since the reaction involves equimolar amounts of carbon and oxygen, the equilibrium concentrations of both elements in the melt are also equal. Therefore, we have:
[C] = 0.7 - x
[O] = x

Step 5: Plug in the values into the equilibrium expression
420.49 = [CO(g)] / ((0.7 - x) * x)

Since the CO(g) formed is in a 1:1 ratio with the oxygen reacted, we can write [CO(g)] = x as well. Now, the expression becomes:
420.49 = x / ((0.7 - x) * x)

Step 6: Solve the equation for x
420.49 * ((0.7 - x) * x) = x
294.343 * x - 420.49 * x^2 = x

Move everything to one side of the equation:
420.49 * x^2 + (294.343 - 1) * x = 0

This is a quadratic equation of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0 with a = 420.49, b = 293.343, and c = 0.

Since c = 0, we can solve for x using the factored form x(ax + b) = 0.
x(420.49x + 293.343) = 0

Step 7: Solve for x
There are two possible solutions for x: 
1. x = 0 (This solution is not possible as it means there is no dissolved oxygen content)
2. 420.49x + 293.343 = 0

Now, solve the second equation for x:
x = -293.343 / 420.49
x = -0.007856

Since we're looking for a positive value of x, we disregard the negative sign for this application. Therefore, the dissolved oxygen content in the melt is:

x = 0.007856 wt.% (rounded to 4 decimal places)

Thus, the dissolved oxygen content of the plain carbon steel melt with 0.7 wt.% C at 1600°C is approximately 0.0079 wt.%. 

Answer: [0.0079]
