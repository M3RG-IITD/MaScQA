Using Henry's law, we have:

$P_{\text{H}_2} = k[H]$

where $k$ is the proportionality constant (Henry's law constant). Since the reaction $H_2 = 2[H]$ shows that the mole ratio between $H_2$ and $[H]$ is 1:2, we can write:

$[H] = \frac{1}{2}[\text{H}_2]$

Substituting into Henry's law expression, we get:

$P_{\text{H}_2} = 2k[H_2]$

At 300°C and $P_{\text{H}_2}$ = 1 atm, the solubility of hydrogen in Pd is given as 1.64 * $10^4 mm^3$ (STP) per kg of Pd. We can use this information to find $k$ as follows:

$k = \frac{P_{\text{H}_2}}{2[H_2]} = \frac{1\text{ atm}}{2\times(1.64\times10^4 \text{ mm}^3\text{ (STP)/kg})} = 3.04\times10^{-8} \frac{\text{mol}}{\text{mm}^3\text{ (STP)}}$

Now we can use the same expression to calculate the solubility of hydrogen in Pd at 300°C and $P_{\text{H}_2}$ = 0.09 atm:

$[H_2] = \frac{P_{\text{H}_2}}{2k} = \frac{0.09\text{ atm}}{2\times3.04\times10^{-8}\frac{\text{mol}}{\text{mm}^3\text{ (STP)}}}=1476.97 \frac{\text{mm}^3\text{ (STP)}}{\text{kg}}$

Rounding off to one decimal place, the answer is 1477.0 $mm^3$ (STP) per kg of Pd.
