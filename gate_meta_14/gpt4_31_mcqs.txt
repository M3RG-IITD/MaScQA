We have: (a/2)[1 -1 0] → (a/6)[2 -1 1] + (a/6)[1 -2 -1]

To find the plane the dislocations lie in, we can use the fact that the vectors of the dislocations should be perpendicular to the normal vector of the plane. 

Let's assume the normal vector of the plane is [h k l].

Now, we have two equations to work with:

1. Dot product of (a/6)[2 -1 1] and [h k l] = 0
2. Dot product of (a/6)[1 -2 -1] and [h k l] = 0

Now let's solve them:

1. (2h - k + l) = 0
2. (h - 2k - l) = 0

From equation (1) we can get: l = k - 2h
Substitute l into equation (2): h - 2k - (k - 2h) = 0
Solving for h and k gives h = k.

Now we can find l: l = h - 2h = -h.

Since h = k, the normal vector of the plane is [1 -1 l] or its multiples.
We can now check the options given:

(A) (-1 1 1) → Here h = -1, k = 1, l = 1; this does not match [1 -1 l]
(B) (1 1 1) → This is not a possibility, as h must be equal to k
(C) (1 -1 1) → Here h = 1, k = -1, l = 1; this matches [1 -1 l]
(D) (1 1 -1) → This is not a possibility, as h must be equal to k

So the correct answer is:

[(C)]
