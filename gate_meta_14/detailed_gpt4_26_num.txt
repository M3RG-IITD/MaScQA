Step 1:
We are given the apparent density ($ρ_{apparent}$) of the metal powder, which is 2.5 g/$cm^3$. This apparent density refers to the density of the loose powder.

Step 2:
We are also given the green density ($ρ_{green}$) of the compacted metal powder, which is 5.5 g/$cm^3$. This green density refers to the density of the compacted powder in the die.

Step 3:
The height of the green sample ($h_{green}$) is given as 12 mm.

Step 4:
We need to find the fill height of the powder ($h_{fill}$), which is the height of the loose powder in the die before it was compacted.

Step 5:
The volume of the green sample ($V_{green}$) and the volume of the fill powder ($V_{fill}$) are related by the conservation of mass principle. That is, the mass of the metal powder is the same before and after compaction:

$$
\rho_{apparent} V_{fill} = \rho_{green} V_{green}
$$

Step 6:
We can express the volumes $V_{fill}$ and $V_{green}$ in terms of their heights and the cross-sectional area ($A$) of the cylindrical die:

$$
V_{fill} = A h_{fill}
$$
$$
V_{green} = A h_{green}
$$

Step 7:
Substituting the expressions for $V_{fill}$ and $V_{green}$ from Step 6 into the conservation of mass equation from Step 5:

$$
\rho_{apparent} (Ah_{fill}) = \rho_{green} (Ah_{green})
$$

Step 8:
Since the cross-sectional area (A) is the same for both the loose powder and the compacted powder, we can cancel A from both sides of the equation:

$$
\rho_{apparent} h_{fill} = \rho_{green} h_{green}
$$

Step 9:
Now, we can rearrange the equation to solve for the fill height ($h_{fill}$):

$$
h_{fill} = \frac{\rho_{green} h_{green}}{\rho_{apparent}}
$$

Step 10:
Plug in the given values for the green density ($ρ_{green} = 5.5$ g/$cm^3$), apparent density ($ρ_{apparent} = 2.5$ g/$cm^3$), and green height ($h_{green} = 12$ mm) and solve for the fill height:

$$
h_{fill} = \frac{(5.5\,\text{g}/\text{cm}^3)(12\,\text{mm})}{2.5\,\text{g}/\text{cm}^3}
$$

Step 11:
Before calculating the fill height, we need to convert the green height from mm to cm, as the density units are in g/$cm^3$:

$$
h_{green} = 12\,\text{mm} \times \frac{1\,\text{cm}}{10\,\text{mm}} = 1.2\,\text{cm}
$$

Step 12:
Now plug in the converted green height and calculate the fill height:

$$
h_{fill} = \frac{(5.5\,\text{g}/\text{cm}^3)(1.2\,\text{cm})}{2.5\,\text{g}/\text{cm}^3} = 2.64\,\text{cm}
$$

Step 13:
Finally, convert the fill height from cm back to mm:

$$
h_{fill} = 2.64\,\text{cm} \times \frac{10\,\text{mm}}{1\,\text{cm}} = 26.4\,\text{mm}
$$

So, the fill height of the powder before compaction would have been 26.4 mm.
