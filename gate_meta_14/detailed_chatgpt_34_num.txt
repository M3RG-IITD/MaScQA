The cell reaction is:

Cu$^{2+}$ (aq, anode) + 2e$^-$ $\longrightarrow$ Cu(s, cathode)

The standard reduction potential for this reaction can be determined using the equation:

$$
\Delta G^{\ominus} = -nF E^{\ominus}
$$

Where $\Delta G^{\ominus}$ is the standard Gibbs free energy change, $n$ is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction (in this case, $n$ = 2), $F$ is the Faraday constant, and $E^{\ominus}$ is the standard reduction potential.

At 25°C, the standard Gibbs free energy change can be calculated using the equation:

$$
\Delta G^{\ominus} = -RT\ln(K)
$$

Where $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin, and $K$ is the equilibrium constant for the reaction.

For the cell reaction, $K$ can be determined from the activity coefficients of copper:

$$
K = \frac{a_{Cu}^{2+}}{a_{Cu(s)}}
$$

At 25°C, the activity of pure copper is equal to 1, so:

$$
K = a_{Cu}^{2+} = 0.8^2 = 0.64
$$

Substituting into the equation for $\Delta G^{\ominus}$:

$$
\Delta G^{\ominus} = -RT\ln(0.64) \approx 18.3\text{ kJ/mol}
$$

Therefore, the standard reduction potential is:

$$
E^{\ominus} = \frac{\Delta G^{\ominus}}{nF} \approx 0.19\text{ V}
$$

The cell potential can be calculated using the equation:

$$
E_{cell} = E_{cathode} - E_{anode} = 0 - E^{\ominus}_{anode}
$$

Since the anode is an alloy with 0.8 activity of copper, its standard reduction potential needs to be adjusted using the Nernst equation:

$$
E_{anode} = E^{\ominus}_{anode} - \frac{RT}{nF}\ln(a_{Cu}^{2+}) \approx 0.176\text{ V}
$$

Substituting into the equation for the cell potential:

$$
E_{cell} = 0 - 0.176\text{ V} = -0.176\text{ V} = -176\text{ mV}
$$

The absolute value of the cell potential is:

$$
|E_{cell}| = 176\text{ mV}
$$

Therefore, the correct answer is:

- 176 mV
