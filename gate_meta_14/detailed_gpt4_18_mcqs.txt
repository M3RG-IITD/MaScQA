Weld decay of austenitic stainless steels is a form of intergranular corrosion that occurs due to the precipitation of chromium-rich carbides at the grain boundaries during welding. The chromium-rich carbides are formed due to the combination of chromium and carbon in the stainless steel. This precipitation of chromium carbides depletes the chromium content, which is responsible for the corrosion resistance of the stainless steels. Hence, it is essential to address the presence of carbon and chromium to avoid weld decay in austenitic stainless steels.

Now, let's analyze each option:

(A) Reducing carbon content: By reducing the carbon content in the stainless steel, the chances of chromium carbide precipitation at the grain boundaries decrease. Lower carbon content leads to less availability of carbon to form these carbides, and thus the chromium depletion at grain boundaries is reduced. This action can help in avoiding weld decay in stainless steel.

(B) Increasing carbon content: Increasing the carbon content will only increase the chances of chromium carbide precipitation at the grain boundaries, leading to more chromium depletion and causing weld decay. Therefore, this option is not helpful in avoiding weld decay.

(C) Eliminating strong carbide formers: Eliminating strong carbide formers can help in minimizing the formation of chromium carbides. However, in the case of austenitic stainless steel, chromium is already present in large amounts which makes this option less effective.

(D) Decreasing chromium content: Decreasing the chromium content might reduce the chromium carbide precipitation, but it will also reduce the corrosion resistance of the stainless steel. Chromium is an essential element in providing corrosion resistance in stainless steel, and reducing its content could lead to other corrosion issues.

Based on the above analysis, reducing the carbon content (option A) is the most effective way to avoid weld decay of austenitic stainless steels.
