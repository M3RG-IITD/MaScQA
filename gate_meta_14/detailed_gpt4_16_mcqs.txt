Step 1: Understanding the question
We need to find the mineral among the given options that serves as a source of titanium.

Step 2: Knowing about the minerals
Let's gather some information about the given minerals.

(A) Haematite
Haematite (Fe2O3) is an iron oxide mineral. It is the most important ore of iron, and its primary use is in the production of iron and steel.

(B) Magnetite
Magnetite (Fe3O4) is an iron oxide mineral. It is also a rich source of iron, occurring mainly in igneous rocks.

(C) Ilmenite
Ilmenite (FeTiO3) is a titanium-iron oxide mineral. It is one of the main sources of titanium along with rutile (TiO2).

(D) Pyrolusite
Pyrolusite (MnO2) is a manganese oxide mineral, primarily found in sedimentary deposits, and it is the main ore of manganese.

Step 3: Identifying the correct mineral
From the information gathered above, it is clear that Ilmenite (FeTiO3) is the mineral that provides a source of titanium, as it is a titanium-iron oxide mineral.

Answer: The correct answer is [C) Ilmenite].
