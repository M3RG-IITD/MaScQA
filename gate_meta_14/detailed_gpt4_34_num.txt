To find the cell potential, we'll use the Nernst equation:

E = E° - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)

where E is the cell potential, E° is the standard cell potential, R is the universal gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, n is the number of electrons transferred (in this case, 2 for divalent copper), F is the Faraday constant, and Q is the reaction quotient.

Since the cathode is pure copper and the anode is an alloy with a copper activity of 0.8, the reaction quotient Q can be written as:

Q = (activity of copper in the anode) / (activity of copper in the cathode)
Q = 0.8 / 1
Q = 0.8

Now let's plug in the values into the Nernst equation:

Temperature (T) = 25°C = 298.15 K

E = E° - (RT/(2F)) * ln(0.8)

Since it's an electrolytic cell, the standard cell potential (E°) is 0:

E = 0 - (8.314 J/(mol.K) * 298.15 K / (2 * 96500 C/mol)) * ln(0.8)

E = - (8.314 * 298.15 / (2 * 96500)) * ln(0.8)

E ≈ -0.0129 * ln(0.8)

E ≈ -0.0129 * -0.22314

E ≈ 0.00288 V

To convert volts to millivolts, multiply by 1000:

E ≈ 0.00288 * 1000
E ≈ 2.88 mV

The absolute value of the cell potential is 2.88 mV.

The correct answer is [2.88].
