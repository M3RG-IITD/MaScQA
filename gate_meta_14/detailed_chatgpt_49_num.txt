Given, the flow curve of the metal as 𝜎 = $200𝜀^{0.25}$

True strain (ε) = 0.3

The formula for ideal plastic work of deformation per unit volume (W) is given by:

W = ∫(σdε)

We need to calculate the value of W in MJ/$m^3$.

Let's begin by substituting the given values in the formula:

W = ∫(σdε) from ε = 0 to ε = 0.3

W = ∫(200ε^(0.25)dε) from ε = 0 to ε = 0.3

W = 200∫(ε^(0.25)dε) from ε = 0 to ε = 0.3

To integrate ∫(ε^(0.25)dε), we substitute ε^(0.25) as u and ε as u^4. Thus, du = (1/4)ε^(-0.75)dε.

∴ ∫(ε^(0.25)dε) = 4∫(u^2 du)

∴ ∫(ε^(0.25)dε) = (4/3)u^3 + C

∴ ∫(ε^(0.25)dε) = (4/3)(ε^(0.75)) + C

Substituting the limits ε=0 to ε=0.3, 

W = 200∫(ε^(0.25)dε) from ε = 0 to ε = 0.3

W = 200[(4/3)(0.3^(0.75))- (4/3)(0^(0.75))]

W = 30.45 MJ/m^3 (approx)

Therefore, the ideal plastic work of deformation per unit volume is 30.45 MJ/m^3. 

Answer: 

The correct answer is:
- 30.45 MJ/$m^3$
