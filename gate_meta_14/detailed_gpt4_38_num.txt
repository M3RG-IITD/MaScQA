The Tresca yield criterion states that yielding begins when the maximum shear stress exceeds the shear yield strength of the material. The Tresca yield criterion can be expressed as:

τ_max = (σ1 - σ3)/2

where τ_max is the maximum shear stress, and σ1 and σ3 are the maximum and minimum principal stresses, respectively.

In this problem, we are given the principal stresses: σ1 = 250 MPa, σ2 = 50 MPa, and σ3 = -50 MPa. We can then find the maximum shear stress using the Tresca yield criterion formula:

Step 1: Find the maximum and minimum principal stresses
σ1 = 250 MPa (maximum principal stress)
σ3 = -50 MPa (minimum principal stress)

Step 2: Calculate the maximum shear stress using the Tresca yield criterion formula
τ_max = (σ1 - σ3) / 2
τ_max = (250 MPa - (-50 MPa)) / 2
τ_max = (300 MPa) / 2
τ_max = 150 MPa

Now we have found the maximum shear stress (τ_max) for this stress state, which is 150 MPa. Since the body starts to yield according to the Tresca criterion, the yield strength of the material in shear (τ_yield) is equal to the maximum shear stress.

τ_yield = τ_max
τ_yield = 150 MPa

The Tresca yield criterion is based on shear stress, but the question asks for the yield strength of the material, which is typically given in terms of uniaxial tensile stress. To find this, we can use the Tresca criterion for uniaxial stress state:

σ_yield = 2*τ_yield

where σ_yield is the yield strength in terms of uniaxial tensile stress. Now, substitute the values:

σ_yield = 2 * (150 MPa)
σ_yield = 300 MPa

So, the yield strength of the material is 300 MPa if Tresca yield criterion is obeyed.

The correct answer is [300 MPa].
