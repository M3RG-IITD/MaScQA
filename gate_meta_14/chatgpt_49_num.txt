To find the ideal plastic work of deformation per unit volume, we need to integrate the flow curve equation with respect to strain:

$$W_p = \int_0^\epsilon \sigma d\epsilon$$

Substituting the given flow curve, we get:

$$W_p = \int_0^{0.3} (200\epsilon^{0.25})d\epsilon$$

Integrating and simplifying:

$$W_p = \frac{800}{7}(0.3^{1.25}) = 6.342 \text{ MJ}/m^3$$

Therefore, the correct answer is:

- 6.342 MJ/$m^3$
