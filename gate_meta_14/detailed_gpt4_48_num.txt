To solve this problem, we need to find the interplanar spacing (d-spacing) between the (111) planes in Aluminium. The d-spacing can be found using the formula derived from Bragg's law.

1. Convert the given atomic radius to the lattice constant
The atomic radius of aluminium (Al) is given as 1.431 Å. Aluminium has a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure, and the lattice constant (a) is related to the atomic radius (r) as follows:

a = 2 * √2 * r

Substitute the value of r:

a = 2 * √2 * 1.431 Å

Calculate the value of a:

a ≈ 4.049 Å

2. Find the d-spacing for the (111) planes
The d-spacing for any plane (hkl) in a cubic crystal can be found using the following formula:

d(hkl) = a / √(h² + k² + l²)

For the (111) plane, h = 1, k = 1, and l = 1. Substitute the values of a, h, k, and l into the formula:

d(111) = 4.049 Å / √(1² + 1² + 1²)
d(111) = 4.049 Å / √3

Calculate the value of d(111):

d(111) ≈ 2.338 Å

Thus, the interplanar spacing (d-spacing) of the (111) planes in aluminium is approximately 2.338 Å.

Answer: [2.338]
