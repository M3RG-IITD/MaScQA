The Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) steelmaking process is a method for producing steel by blowing oxygen into pig iron to reduce the amount of carbon, and subsequently remove unwanted impurities, such as sulfur and phosphorus. Phosphorus removal is critical in the steelmaking process, as it can cause brittleness and other undesirable characteristics in the final product.

Now, let's analyze each factor and determine whether it is desirable for effective phosphorus removal in the BOF steelmaking process:

(A) Higher FeO level in slag:
Higher FeO levels in slag increase the slag's ability to absorb phosphorus from the molten steel. This is because the FeO reacts with phosphorus to form iron phosphide, thereby removing it from the steel. Thus, a higher FeO level in slag is desirable for effective phosphorus removal.

(B) Higher basicity:
Basicity is a term used to describe the ratio of basic oxides (like calcium oxide, CaO) to acidic oxides (like silica, SiO2) in the slag. Higher basicity indicates a greater proportion of basic oxides, which helps in increasing the solubility of phosphorus in slag. This aids in the removal of phosphorus from the molten steel, making higher basicity desirable for effective phosphorus removal.

(C) Higher temperature:
Higher temperatures increase the reaction rates between slag and impurities (like phosphorus) in the molten steel. The higher temperatures also lead to a lower viscosity of the slag, which in turn leads to better mixing between slag and steel, and thus improves phosphorus removal. Therefore, higher temperature is desirable for effective phosphorus removal.

(D) Lower temperature:
Lower temperatures might reduce the solubility of phosphorus in the slag, decreasing the removal of phosphorus from molten steel. Moreover, lower temperatures can increase the viscosity of the slag, making it harder for impurities to be absorbed by the slag. Hence, lower temperature is NOT desirable for effective phosphorus removal.

So, the answer is (D) Lower temperature, which is NOT desirable for effective phosphorus removal in the BOF steelmaking process.

Correct answer: [D]
