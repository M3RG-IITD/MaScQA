We are looking for the property of a material that refers to its ability to absorb energy when deformed elastically. Let's first understand the given terms and analyze which one fits the description:

(A) Toughness: It is the ability of a material to absorb energy and plastically deform without fracturing or breaking. Therefore, it is not related to elastic deformations.

(B) Fracture toughness: It refers to the ability of a material containing a crack to resist further crack extension and ultimately breaking. It is a property associated with the material's resistance to fracture rather than elasticity.

(C) Resilience: It is the ability of a material to store and release elastic potential energy during deformations. In other words, it is the capacity of a material to absorb energy when it's deformed elastically and return to its original shape after the stress is removed.

(D) Hardness: It is a measure of a material's resistance to localized plastic deformation or permanent indentation, i.e., its ability to resist scratching, wear, and indentation.

Based on these definitions, we can conclude that:

The correct answer is (C) Resilience, as it refers to the ability of a material to absorb energy when deformed elastically.

To summarize:

1. Understand the given terms and their definitions.
2. Analyze which property fits the description of the ability to absorb energy when deformed elastically.
3. Identify the correct answer based on the analysis.

Answer: [(C) Resilience]
