To answer this question, we need to understand the role of silicon in pig iron production, and how temperature and basicity affect its formation.

Pig iron is an intermediate product of iron production in the blast furnace. It contains around 95% iron, along with various impurities such as silicon, carbon, sulfur, and phosphorus. It serves as the raw material for the production of steel.

Silicon: In pig iron production, silicon is introduced from the raw materials such as iron ore, coke, and fluxes (typically limestone and dolomite). Silicon is not a desired element, especially when producing steel from pig iron because it reduces the ductility and can cause cracks.

Temperature: The blast furnace operates at a high temperature of around 2000°C (3632°F) to reduce iron ore to metallic iron. Higher temperatures result in a more efficient reduction of silicon.

Basicity: Basicity of the slag is a crucial parameter in the blast furnace process, in which the acidic silica (SiO2) and basic flux materials (e.g. limestone and dolomite) react. SiO2 + CaO → CaSiO3 (calcium silicate). The higher the basicity, the more silica will be removed because more calcium oxide (CaO) can react with silica, thus lowering the silicon content in the pig iron. 

Now, let's analyze each option:

A) Higher temperature and higher basicity: This would result in a more efficient reduction of silicon, due to increased reactivity of the silica with the basic fluxes, and consequently, the low silicon pig iron production would be favored.

B) Lower temperature and lower basicity: Lower temperature would not favor the efficient reduction of silicon, and lower basicity would not provide enough basic fluxes to react with silica, resulting in higher silicon content in pig iron.

C) Lower temperature and higher basicity: Despite a high basicity in this case, the lower temperature would not provide sufficient energy for efficient reaction between silica and basic fluxes, which would affect silicon removal.

D) Higher temperature and lower basicity: The high temperature would favor the efficient reduction of silicon, but the low basicity would limit the amount of basic fluxes available for reacting with silica, which might not lead to the desired low silicon content in pig iron.

In conclusion, the correct answer is:

[A] Higher temperature and higher basicity
