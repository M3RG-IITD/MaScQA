To determine which microstructure of a Ni-base superalloy imparts the highest creep resistance, we must first understand what creep is and evaluate each of the given choices.

Creep is the time-dependent deformation of a material at elevated temperatures under constant stress. Creep resistance is the ability of a material to withstand and resist deformation and failure caused by creep. The main factors affecting creep resistance are crystal structure, grain boundaries, and the presence of secondary phases.

Let's evaluate each of the given choices:

(A) Fine grained equiaxed
A fine-grained equiaxed microstructure has small, equal-sized grains. This microstructure provides good overall mechanical properties, such as strength and ductility. The large number of grain boundaries can act as barriers to dislocation movement and provide resistance to creep. However, the grain boundaries can also act as sites for the initiation of creep deformation and grain boundary sliding, thereby limiting the creep resistance.

(B) Coarse grained equiaxed
A coarse-grained equiaxed microstructure has large, equal-sized grains. This structure has lower strength and ductility than the fine-grained counterpart. The fewer grain boundaries in this structure provide fewer barriers to dislocation movement, thus resulting in lower creep resistance compared to fine-grained equiaxed structures.

(C) Columnar
A columnar microstructure is characterized by elongated grains oriented in the same direction, which is generally perpendicular to the direction of solidification. This structure provides enhanced resistance to deformation along the grain boundaries. However, the creep resistance in the direction parallel to the grain length is limited due to the alignment of grains in that direction.

(D) Single crystal
A single crystal microstructure has no grain boundaries, as the entire structure is a single, continuous crystal. The absence of grain boundaries eliminates the possibility of grain boundary sliding and the initiation of creep deformation at the boundaries. This structure has the highest creep resistance among the given choices, as it relies solely on the crystal lattice's resistance to dislocation movement.

Based on the assessments above, the correct answer is :
