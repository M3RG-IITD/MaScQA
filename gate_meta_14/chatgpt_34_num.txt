The cell potential is given by the Nernst equation:

$E = \frac{RT}{nF} \ln\left(\frac{a_{Cu}^{2}}{[Cu^{2+}]}\right)$

where $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin, $n$ is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction (in this case, 2), $F$ is the Faraday constant, $a_{Cu}$ is the activity of copper at the anode, and $[Cu^{2+}]$ is the concentration of copper ions at the cathode.

At the anode, copper metal is oxidized to copper ions:

$Cu \rightarrow Cu^{2+} + 2e^{-}$

At the cathode, copper ions are reduced to copper metal:

$Cu^{2+} + 2e^{-} \rightarrow Cu$

The overall reaction is:

$Cu \rightarrow Cu^{2+} + 2e^{-} \\
Cu^{2+} + 2e^{-} \rightarrow Cu \\
\Rightarrow Cu \rightarrow Cu$

Therefore, the concentration of copper ions at the cathode is the same as the activity of copper at the anode:

$[Cu^{2+}] = a_{Cu} = 0.8$

Substituting the values into the Nernst equation, we get:

$E = \frac{8.314 \text{ J/(mol.K)} \times 298 \text{ K}}{2 \times 96500 \text{ C/mol}} \ln\left(\frac{0.8^{2}}{0.8}\right) = -0.282 \text{ V}$

Finally, we convert the result to millivolts by multiplying by 1000:

$E = -282 \text{ mV}$

Therefore, the absolute value of the cell potential is:

$|E| = 282 \text{ mV}$

Answer: [282 mV].
