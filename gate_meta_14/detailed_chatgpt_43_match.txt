Group I:
P. Blast Furnace Ironmaking - This process involves reducing iron ore to iron using coke as fuel and smelting agent in a blast furnace.

Q. BOF Steelmaking - This process involves the oxidation of impurities in hot metal using oxygen blowing.

R. Hall-Heroult Process - This process involves electrolytic reduction of Al2O3 to obtain aluminium.

S. Bayer Process - This process involves the leaching of alumina from bauxite using hot concentrated sodium hydroxide solution.

Group II:
1. Refining - This process involves removing impurities from a metal.

2. Electrolysis - This process uses an electric current to drive a non-spontaneous chemical reaction.

3. Smelting - This process involves extracting a metal from its ore by heating beyond its melting point.

4. Leaching - This process involves extracting a substance by dissolving it in a liquid.

Matching them, we get:
P-3 (Smelting) - Blast furnace ironmaking involves reducing iron ore to iron in a blast furnace.
Q-1 (Refining) - BOF steelmaking involves oxidizing impurities in hot metal.
R-4 (Leaching) - Hall-Heroult process involves leaching out alumina from bauxite.
S-2 (Electrolysis) - Bayer process involves electrolysis of Al2O3 to obtain aluminium.

Hence, the answer is (D) P-3, Q-1, R-4, S-2.
