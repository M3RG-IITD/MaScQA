The correct answer is (A) $(洧랞_洧논)^洧띺 = $(洧랞_洧녽)^洧띻 and $(洧랞_洧논)^洧띻 = $(洧랞_洧녽)^洧띺. 

For two phases to be in thermodynamic equilibrium, the chemical potential of each component in each phase must be equal. So, we have: 

$$(洧랞_洧논)^洧띺 = (洧랞_洧녽)^洧띺 = (洧랞_洧논)^洧띻 = (洧랞_洧녽)^洧띻$$

Since we only have two components, we can simplify this to: 

$$(洧랞_洧논)^洧띺 = (洧랞_洧녽)^洧띻$$
$$(洧랞_洧논)^洧띻 = (洧랞_洧녽)^洧띺$$

Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer.
