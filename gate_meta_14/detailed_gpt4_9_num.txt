To solve this problem, we will use the formula for strain rate, which is:

Strain rate = (Change in length) / (Original length * Time)

We are given the following information:

- Strain rate at the start of the test: 5 * 10^(-3) s^(-1)
- Crosshead speed: 6 mm/min

First, we will convert the crosshead speed to mm/s:

Crosshead speed = 6 mm/min * (1 min / 60 s) = 0.1 mm/s

Now, we will use the formula for strain rate to determine the initial gauge length (L):

Strain rate = (Change in length) / (Original length * Time)

Since the crosshead speed is constant, the change in length per unit time (dL/dt) will be equal to the crosshead speed. Therefore, we can rewrite the formula as:

Strain rate = (dL/dt) / L

Now, we will solve for the initial gauge length (L):

5 * 10^(-3) s^(-1) = 0.1 mm/s / L

Rearrange the equation to isolate L:

L = 0.1 mm/s / (5 * 10^(-3) s^(-1))

L = 0.1 mm/s / 0.005 s^(-1)

L = 20 mm

So, the initial gauge length of the specimen is 20 mm.
