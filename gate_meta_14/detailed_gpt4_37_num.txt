Sievert's law states that the concentration of a dissolved gas (like hydrogen) in a metal is directly proportional to the square root of the gas's partial pressure. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

C = k * √P

where C is the concentration of hydrogen in the metal, P is the partial pressure of hydrogen, and k is a constant of proportionality that depends on the metal and temperature.

Let's label the initial partial pressure as P1 and the initial concentration as C1. When the partial pressure is increased by a factor of 4, we have a new partial pressure P2 = 4 * P1 and a new concentration C2.

We can start by expressing Sievert's law for the initial conditions (C1 and P1):

C1 = k * √P1

Now we'll express Sievert's law for the new conditions (C2 and P2):

C2 = k * √(4 * P1)

To find the factor by which the solubility increases, we want to determine the ratio C2/C1. To do this, we'll divide the second equation by the first equation:

(C2) / (C1) = (k * √(4 * P1)) / (k * √P1)

The k term cancels out, as does one of the √P1 terms:

(C2) / (C1) = √4

Taking the square root of 4:

(C2) / (C1) = 2

Thus, the solubility increases by a factor of 2 when the partial pressure of hydrogen in contact with the foil is increased by a factor of 4. To recap, the steps we took were:

1. Write Sievert's law for the initial conditions.
2. Write Sievert's law for the new conditions.
3. Divide the second equation by the first equation to find the ratio of the new concentration to the initial concentration.
4. Simplify the expression and solve for the factor by which the solubility increases.

The answer is [2].
