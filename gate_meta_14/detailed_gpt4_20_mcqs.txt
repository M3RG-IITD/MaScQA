To identify the type of invariant reaction, we need to understand the basic definitions of the terms.

(A) Eutectic: 
This is an invariant reaction where a liquid solution becomes two solid phases at a specific temperature and composition. It can be represented as:
liquid → solid 1 + solid 2

(B) Eutectoid: 
This is an invariant reaction where a solid solution changes into two different solid phases at a specific temperature and composition. It can be represented as:
solid 1 → solid 2 + solid 3

(C) Peritectic: 
This is an invariant reaction where a liquid phase and a solid phase 1 react to form a different solid phase 2 at a specific temperature and composition. It can be represented as:
liquid + solid 1 → solid 2

(D) Peritectoid: 
This is an invariant reaction where two solid phases react to form a third solid phase at a specific temperature and composition. It can be represented as:
solid 1 + solid 2 → solid 3

Now, let's analyze the given invariant reaction:
liquid 1 + solid 1 ⇌ solid 2

In this given reaction, a liquid phase and a solid phase react to form a different solid phase. It matches the definition of a peritectic reaction (C).

Thus, the type of the invariant reaction is peritectic.

The correct answer is [C].
