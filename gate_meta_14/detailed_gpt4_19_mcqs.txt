Let's analyze each statement one by one:

(A) As the average grain size increases, the grain boundary energy per unit area decreases.

This statement is true. The larger the grain size, the less surface area is available for grain boundaries. As a result, the total grain boundary energy per unit area decreases.

(B) The driving force for grain growth is the decrease in grain boundary energy per unit volume of the material.

This statement is true as well. The system seeks to minimize the total energy, and thus grain growth occurs to decrease the grain boundary energy per unit volume.

(C) Higher the temperature, the faster is the grain growth.

This statement is true. An increase in temperature enhances the rate of atomic diffusion, which in turn accelerates the process of grain growth.

(D) Impurity atoms segregated at grain boundaries can retard grain growth.

This statement is true. Impurities can get "pinned" at the grain boundaries, forming barriers that slow down the motion of the grain boundary during grain growth. These impurities can thus hinder the grain growth process.

All of the given statements seem to be true, but the question asks for the INCORRECT statement. It seems there might be a confusion in the question itself. Therefore, we cannot provide a correct answer within the given statements.

So, the list of correct answers would be:
