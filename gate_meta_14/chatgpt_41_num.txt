The elastic strain (in %) that is recovered when the rod is completely unloaded can be found using the formula:

$\text{Stress} = \text{Young's modulus} \times \text{Strain}$

where stress is given in Pa and Young's modulus is given in Pa. We can rearrange this equation to solve for strain:

$\text{Strain} = \dfrac{\text{Stress}}{\text{Young's modulus}}$

Substituting the given values, we get:

$\text{Strain} = \dfrac{400 \text{ MPa}}{200 \text{ GPa}} = 0.002 = 0.2\%$

Therefore, the elastic strain (in %) that is recovered when the rod is completely unloaded is 0.2%.

Answer: [0.2%]
