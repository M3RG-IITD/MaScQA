To find the elastic modulus of the composite along the fibre direction, we can use the rule of mixtures. The rule of mixtures states that the elastic modulus of a composite material (E_c) is the sum of the elastic moduli of each component (E_f for the fibre, E_m for the matrix) multiplied by their respective volume fractions (V_f for the fibre, V_m for the matrix).

E_c = E_f * V_f + E_m * V_m

We are given the weight fractions of the glass fibre and epoxy. We need to convert these into volume fractions, which can be done using the densities of each component:

V_f = (wt.% of fibres) * (density of the matrix) / ((density of the fibres) * (1 - wt.% of fibres) + (density of the matrix) * (wt.% of fibres))

V_f = (0.6) * (1.14) / ((2.58) * (1 - 0.6) + (1.14) * (0.6))

V_f = 0.684 / (1.032 + 0.684)

V_f ≈ 0.558

Now that we have the volume fraction of the fibres, we can find the volume fraction of the matrix (V_m):

V_m = 1 - V_f

V_m = 1 - 0.558

V_m ≈ 0.442

Now, using the rule of mixtures, we can find the elastic modulus of the composite:

E_c = E_f * V_f + E_m * V_m

E_c = (72.5 GPa) * (0.558) + (2.4 GPa) * (0.442)

E_c ≈ 40.57 GPa + 1.058 GPa

E_c ≈ 41.628 GPa

So the elastic modulus of the composite along the fibre direction is approximately 41.628 GPa.
