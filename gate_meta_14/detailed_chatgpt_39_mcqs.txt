The assertion is true but the reason is false. Deoxidation and decarburization of liquid steel can indeed be done by a vacuum treatment process, but it is not because it promotes a decreased partial pressure of CO(g). Rather, the vacuum treatment process creates a low-pressure atmosphere that encourages the removal of gases, including oxygen and carbon, from the liquid steel. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) a is true but r is false.
