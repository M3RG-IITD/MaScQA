Given that the activity coefficient of Q, $𝛾_Q$ in a liquid Q-R alloy can be represented by the equation:

ln $𝛾_Q$ = $0.6*(x_R)^2$ - 0.2*$(x_R)^3$

We are asked to find the activity of Q in an alloy of composition $x_R = 0.6$ at the same temperature.

First, we will substitute the given value of the composition, $x_R = 0.6$, into the equation for ln $𝛾_Q$:

ln $𝛾_Q$ = $0.6*(0.6)^2$ - 0.2*$(0.6)^3$

Now, let's simplify the equation by performing the exponentiations and multiplications:

ln $𝛾_Q$ = $0.6*(0.36)$ - 0.2*$(0.216)$
ln $𝛾_Q$ = $0.216$ - $0.0432$
ln $𝛾_Q$ = $0.1728$

Now that we have the natural logarithm of the activity coefficient, we can find the activity coefficient itself by taking the exponent of both sides of the equation:

$𝛾_Q = e^{0.1728}$

Calculating the exponent for $0.1728$ gives:

$𝛾_Q ≈ 1.18856$

The activity of Q in an alloy is defined as the product of its activity coefficient and its mole fraction:

$A_Q = 𝛾_Q * x_Q$

Since $x_R = 0.6$, we can find the mole fraction of Q as:

$x_Q = 1 - x_R = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4$

Now we can find the activity of Q:

$A_Q = 1.18856 * 0.4 ≈ 0.475424$

Therefore, the activity of Q in an alloy of composition $x_R = 0.6$ at the same temperature is approximately 0.475424.

Answer: [0.475424]
