Creep resistance is the ability of a material to resist deformation over time under constant load, typically at high temperatures. The highest creep resistance is generally associated with a microstructure that has a high degree of homogeneity and a lack of defects, which reduce the material's strength and promote creep deformation. 

Of the four microstructures given, the single crystal would be expected to provide the highest creep resistance. This is because a single crystal has an ideal, defect-free structure with a uniformly oriented lattice throughout the entire material, which reduces the number of potential slip planes and dislocation pile-ups that lead to creep. 

The other microstructures listed all have some degree of grain boundaries and crystal defects that can act as sites for slip and deformation under load. Among these, a fine grained equiaxed microstructure (A) would be expected to provide the next highest level of creep resistance due to the small grain size, which limits the distance that dislocations can move before encountering a grain boundary. 

Coarse grained equiaxed microstructures (B) and columnar microstructures (C) both have larger grain sizes and more grain boundaries compared to fine-grained equiaxed microstructures, which can promote creep deformation by allowing dislocations to move more easily. Columnar microstructures also have a directional grain alignment that can lead to anisotropic deformation behavior. 

Therefore, the correct answer is:

- (D) Single crystal
