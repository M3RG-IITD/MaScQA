The correct answer is (B) the volume of the oxide divided by the volume of the metal consumed in oxide formation. 

The Pilling-Bedworth ratio is a measure of the difficulty of metal oxidation. It is defined as the ratio of the volume of the oxide to the volume of the metal consumed in oxide formation. A Pilling-Bedworth ratio greater than one indicates that the oxide will occupy more volume than the metal consumed, resulting in cracking and spalling of the oxide layer. This is a common problem in high-temperature oxidation of metals. 

(A) is incorrect because it relates to the molar weight of the oxide and the metal consumed, not the volume. 

(C) is incorrect because it relates to the density of the oxide and the metal consumed, not the volume. 

(D) is incorrect because it relates to the molar Gibbs energy, which is not a direct measure of volume.
