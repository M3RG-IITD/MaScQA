To solve this question, we need to know the crystal structures of the elements provided in Group I.

P. Tungsten (W): Tungsten has a body-centered cubic (BCC) crystal structure.

Q. Nickel (Ni): Nickel has a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure.

R. Magnesium (Mg): Magnesium has a hexagonal close-packed (HCP) crystal structure.

S. Polonium (Po): Polonium has a simple cubic (SC) crystal structure.

Now that we know the crystal structures of these elements, we can match them with their corresponding crystal structures in Group II:

P-3 (Tungsten - BCC)
Q-4 (Nickel - FCC)
R-1 (Magnesium - HCP)
S-2 (Polonium - Simple Cubic)

Combining the answers in the required format:

Correct answer: (B) [P-3, Q-4, R-1, S-2]
