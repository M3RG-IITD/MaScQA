The correct answer is (C) Ilmenite.

Explanation:

Titanium is a chemical element with the symbol Ti and atomic number 22. It is a strong, lustrous, and corrosion-resistant transition metal. 

Ilmenite is a common accessory mineral found in igneous rocks, sediments, and metamorphic rocks. It is a major source of titanium and is highly magnetic. It is often found together with magnetite and other heavy minerals. Ilmenite is mined for titanium dioxide, which is used to produce white pigment for paints, plastics, and paper. 

Haematite is an iron oxide mineral and the principal ore of iron. It is a common mineral found in sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous rocks. 

Magnetite is an iron oxide mineral that is highly magnetic. It is a common mineral found in igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks. Magnetite is an important source of iron and is used to make steel. 

Pyrolusite is a manganese oxide mineral that is often found in sedimentary rocks. It is a major source of manganese and is used to make batteries and other chemical products. It is not a source of titanium. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Ilmenite.
