The position vector r in three-dimensional space can be represented as r = xi + yj + zk, where i, j, and k are unit vectors along the x, y, and z axes, respectively, and x, y, and z are the coordinates of the point.

The divergence of a vector field F = (P, Q, R) is given by the sum of the partial derivatives of its components with respect to their corresponding coordinates:

div F = (∂P/∂x) + (∂Q/∂y) + (∂R/∂z)

For the position vector r = (x, y, z), we have P = x, Q = y, and R = z. Therefore, the divergence of r is:

div r = (∂x/∂x) + (∂y/∂y) + (∂z/∂z) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

So, the correct answer is (D) 3.
