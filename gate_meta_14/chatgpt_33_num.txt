The balanced chemical equation for the combustion of $CH_4$ is:

$$ CH_4 + 2O_2 \rightarrow CO_2 + 2H_2O $$

This equation tells us that one molecule ($1mol$) of $CH_4$ reacts with two molecules ($2mol$) of $O_2$ to produce one molecule ($1mol$) of $CO_2$ and two molecules ($2mol$) of $H_2O$.

To calculate the theoretical requirement of air for the combustion of $100m^3$ of $CH_4$ at STP, we need to determine how much $O_2$ is required based on the amount of $CH_4$ present. One way to do this is to use the molar volume of gases at STP, which is 22.4 $L/mol$. Therefore, $100m^3$ of $CH_4$ at STP represents:

$$ n = \dfrac{V}{V_{molar}} = \dfrac{100m^3}{22.4 L/mol} = 4464.3 mol $$

This means we need 2 times as many moles of $O_2$:

$$ n_{O_2} = 2n_{CH_4} = 8928.6 \text{ mol} $$

Since air contains 21 vol.% of oxygen, we can assume that 21 vol.% of air is $O_2$ and the remaining 79 vol.% is $N_2$. Therefore, the total volume of air required is:

$$ V_{air} = \dfrac{100}{21} \times 8928.6 \text{ mol} \times 22.4 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m}^3/\text{mol} = 38.4 \text{ m}^3 $$

Answer: The theoretical requirement of air for the complete combustion of 100 $m^3$ (at STP) of pure $CH_4$ is 38.4 $m^3$.
