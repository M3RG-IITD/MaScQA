To determine the elastic strain recovered when the rod is completely unloaded, we can use the formula:

Strain = Stress / Young's Modulus

Given, Stress = 400 MPa = 400 * 10^6 Pa (converting MPa to Pa) and Young's modulus = 200 GPa = 200 * 10^9 Pa (converting GPa to Pa)

Now, calculate Strain:

Strain = (400 * 10^6 Pa) / (200 * 10^9 Pa)
Strain = 2 * 10^-3

To convert the strain to percentage, multiply by 100:

Strain (%) = 2 * 10^-3 * 100
Strain (%) = 0.2 %

The elastic strain that is recovered when the rod is completely unloaded is 0.2%. So, the answer is [0.2].
