The correct answer is:

(C) P-4, Q-3, R-1, S-2

Explanation:

- Grain size strengthening (P) occurs when the grain size of a metal is reduced, which increases the number of grain boundaries that impede dislocation motion. Dislocation pileup at grain boundaries (4) is responsible for this strengthening mechanism.
- Work hardening (Q) is the result of plastic deformation of a metal, which increases the internal dislocation density. Lomer-Cottrell barrier (3) is responsible for this strengthening mechanism.
- Dispersion strengthening (R) occurs when small, hard particles are dispersed throughout a softer matrix, impeding dislocation motion. Suzuki interaction (1) is responsible for this strengthening mechanism.
- Solid solution hardening (S) occurs when impurity atoms are dissolved into the metal matrix, creating lattice strain and impeding dislocation motion. Orowan looping (2) is responsible for this strengthening mechanism.
