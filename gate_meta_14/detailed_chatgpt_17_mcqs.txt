The stress amplitude is the difference between the maximum stress and the minimum stress divided by two. 

Stress amplitude = (Max stress - Min stress) / 2

In this case, the maximum stress is 400 MPa in tension and the minimum stress is 300 MPa in compression. 

Therefore, stress amplitude = (400 - (-300)) / 2
                        = 700 / 2
                        = 350 MPa

The stress amplitude is 350 MPa. 

Answer: 
- Stress amplitude = 350 MPa.
