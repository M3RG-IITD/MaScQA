A scanning electron microscope (SEM) is a powerful tool used to study and analyze different types of specimens. It functions by producing a focused beam of electrons, which hits the surface of the specimen and generates various signals. These signals can provide valuable information about the sample's composition, structure, and other properties. We will explore each of the answer choices one by one and determine which one is correct.

(A) Secondary electrons: Secondary electrons are electrons that are emitted from the specimen when the primary electron beam interacts with it. They are mainly responsible for providing high-resolution images in SEM as they give information about the surface structure and topography of the specimen. However, they are not used for quantitative elemental analysis in SEM.

(B) Backscattered electrons: Backscattered electrons are primary electrons that have interacted with the specimen and are scattered back out with varying angles and energies. They are sensitive to the atomic number of the elements in the sample and can give compositional information. Although backscattered electrons can help in detecting the presence of elements in a sample, their signal is less specific compared to other signals and does not provide a quantitative elemental analysis.

(C) X-rays: When the primary electron beam hits the specimen, it can cause the ejection of inner-shell electrons from the atoms present in the material. The vacancies created are then filled by outer-shell electrons, which leads to the emission of characteristic X-rays. These X-rays are unique to each element, allowing for a precise identification of the elements present in the sample. Using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) techniques, the intensity of the emitted X-rays can be used to perform quantitative elemental analysis. Therefore, X-rays are the correct answer for this question.

(D) Transmitted electrons: Transmitted electrons are the electrons that pass through the specimen in a transmission electron microscope (TEM), rather than a scanning electron microscope (SEM). These electrons are used to generate images and analyze the internal structure of the specimen in TEM but are not applicable for quantitative elemental analysis in SEM.

In conclusion, the correct answer for the question is:

[C] X-rays
