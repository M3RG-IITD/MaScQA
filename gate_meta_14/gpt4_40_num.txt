Chvorinov's rule states that t = k(V/A)^n, where t is the solidification time, V is the volume of the casting, A is the surface area of the casting, k is a constant, and n is an exponent usually equal to 2.

Since we know the solidified thickness after 2 minutes is 3 cm, 
we can write the equation:
2 = k(V1/A1)^2

After 4 minutes, we need to find the solidified thickness, so the equation will be:
4 = k(V2/A2)^2

Taking the ratio of the solidification time equations, we get:

(4/2) = ((V2/A2)^2) / ((V1/A1)^2)

Since the thickness of the rectangular slab has increased, we will assume that the length and width of the slab remain constant. Therefore, V1/A1 = 3 cm and V2/A2 = x, where x represents the increased thickness in cm.

2 = (x^2) / (3^2)

Now, we can solve this equation to find the thickness x after 4 minutes:

x^2 = 2 * (3^2)

x^2 = 2 * 9

x^2 = 18

x = sqrt(18)

x â‰ˆ 4.24 cm

Therefore, the solidified thickness after 4 minutes will be approximately 4.24 cm.

The correct answer inside a list is: [4.24]
