To find the fill height of the powder, we can use the formula:

Fill height = (Green height * Green density) / Apparent density

Fill height = (12 mm * 5.5 g/cm³) / 2.5 g/cm³

First, let's convert g/cm³ to g/mm³:

5.5 g/cm³ = (5.5 / 1000) g/mm³ = 0.0055 g/mm³
2.5 g/cm³ = (2.5 / 1000) g/mm³ = 0.0025 g/mm³

Now, we can find the fill height:

Fill height = (12 mm * 0.0055 g/mm³) / 0.0025 g/mm³
Fill height = (0.066 g/mm³) / 0.0025 g/mm³
Fill height = 26.4 mm

So the fill height of the powder would have been 26.4 mm.

Answer: [26.4]
