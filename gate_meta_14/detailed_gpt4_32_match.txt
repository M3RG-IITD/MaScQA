First, let's understand each type of corrosion from Group I and then match with the examples in Group II.

Group I:
P. Galvanic corrosion - It occurs when two dissimilar metals are in contact with each other in the presence of an electrolyte. One of the materials will act as an anode, losing metal ions, while the other one will act as a cathode, receiving the electrons from the anode.

Q. Filiform corrosion - It is a type of corrosion that occurs under a coating, typically paint. It is characterized by the formation of thread-like filaments of corrosion products that penetrate the coating, making it look as if the coating is crawling.

R. Stress corrosion cracking - This is a type of corrosion that occurs when a susceptible material is subjected to a corrosive environment and tensile stress. The material may fracture or crack due to the combined action of corrosion and stress.

S. Crevice corrosion - It is a type of localized corrosion that occurs in confined spaces or crevices between two contacting surfaces. It is the result of the difference in the concentration of ions in the electrolyte solution within the crevice and the surrounding area.

Now, let's match these with the examples in Group II:

1. Season cracking in brass - This is an example of stress corrosion cracking. In this case, the brass is subjected to stress and a corrosive environment, causing cracks to form. So, 1 corresponds to R (Stress corrosion cracking).

2. Nut-bolt assembly with gasket - This is an example of crevice corrosion. The confined space created between the nut, bolt, and the gasket will create an electrolyte solution with different ion concentrations compared to the surrounding area, leading to localized corrosion. So, 2 corresponds to S (Crevice corrosion).

3. Brass fittings joined with lead-tin solder - This is an example of galvanic corrosion. The brass and lead-tin solder are dissimilar metals that can act as anode and cathode, respectively, when they are in contact in the presence of an electrolyte. This will cause corrosion in one of the materials. So, 3 corresponds to P (Galvanic corrosion).

4. Painted food can - This is an example of filiform corrosion. The corrosion can occur under the paint of the food can, creating thread-like filaments of corrosion products that look as if the coating is crawling. So, 4 corresponds to Q (Filiform corrosion).

Matching the types of corrosion and their examples, we get:

P - 3 (Galvanic corrosion - Brass fittings joined with lead-tin solder)
Q - 4 (Filiform corrosion - Painted food can)
R - 1 (Stress corrosion cracking - Season cracking in brass)
S - 2 (Crevice corrosion - Nut-bolt assembly with gasket)

Hence, the correct answer is (C) P-3, Q-4, R-1, S-2.
