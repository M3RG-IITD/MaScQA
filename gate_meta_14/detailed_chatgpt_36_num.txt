Unfortunately, there is no image provided in the question. The hydrostatic stress can be calculated for any state of stress represented by a stress tensor $σ_{ij}$ using the formula:

$σ_{hyd}=\frac{1}{3}σ_{kk}$

where $σ_{kk}$ is the trace of the stress tensor. The trace is found by summing the diagonal elements of the matrix, i.e.

$σ_{kk}=σ_{11}+σ_{22}+σ_{33}$

Once we have determined the value of $σ_{kk}$, we substitute it in the above formula to get $σ_{hyd}$.

Therefore, please provide the values of $σ_{ij}$ matrix or an image to solve the problem.
