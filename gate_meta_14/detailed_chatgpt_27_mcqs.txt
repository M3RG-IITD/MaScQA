The true strain, ε, is given by:

ε = ln (L_f / L_i)

where L_f is the final gauge length and L_i is the initial gauge length.

We are given that ε = 0.405 and ΔL = L_f - L_i = 5 mm.

We can rearrange the equation for true strain to get:

L_f = L_i * e^ε

Substituting the given values, we get:

L_f = L_i * e^0.405

We can solve for L_i by using the equation:

ΔL = L_f - L_i

Substituting the known values, we get:

5 mm = L_i * (e^0.405 - 1)

Solving for L_i:

L_i = 5 mm / (e^0.405 - 1)

L_i ≈  10 mm (to three significant figures)

Therefore, the final gauge length of the specimen is:

L_f = L_i * e^0.405

L_f ≈  15 mm (to three significant figures)

The correct answer is (C) 15.
