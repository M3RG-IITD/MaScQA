To find the interplanar spacing of (111) planes in Aluminium, we need to use the formula for face-centered cubic (FCC) unit cell structure:

d(hkl) = a / √(h² + k² + l²)

Where d(hkl) is the interplanar spacing of the (hkl) plane, a is the lattice constant, and (h, k, l) are the Miller indices.

For FCC, the lattice constant a is related to the atomic radius (r) by the following formula:

a = 2√2 * r

Given the atomic radius of aluminium is 1.431 Å, we can calculate the lattice constant a:

a = 2√2 * 1.431
a ≈ 4.049 Å

Now, we can find the interplanar spacing for (111) plane:

d(111) = 4.049 / √(1² + 1² + 1²)
d(111) ≈ 4.049 / √3
d(111) ≈ 2.338 Å

So, the interplanar spacing of (111) planes in aluminium is approximately 2.338 Å.

Answer: [2.338]
