Given:

Weight fraction of glass fiber = 60 %

Weight fraction of epoxy = (100 - 60) % = 40 %

Elastic modulus of glass fiber ($E_g$) = 72.5 GPa

Elastic modulus of epoxy matrix ($E_m$) = 2.4 GPa

Density of glass fiber ($\rho_g$) = $2.58 g/cm^3$

Density of epoxy matrix ($\rho_m$) = $1.14 g/cm^3$

To find:

Elastic modulus of composite along the fiber direction

Solution:

Let us first find the volume fractions of glass fiber and epoxy matrix in the composite.

The volume fraction of glass fiber ($V_g$) can be calculated as:

$V_g$ = Weight fraction of glass fiber / Density of glass fiber

       = 0.60 / 2.58 

       = 0.2326

Similarly, the volume fraction of epoxy matrix ($V_m$) can be calculated as:

$V_m$ = Weight fraction of epoxy matrix / Density of epoxy matrix

       = 0.40 / 1.14 

       = 0.3509

The volume fractions of glass fiber and epoxy matrix add up to 1, as expected.

The elastic modulus along the fiber direction for the composite is given by the rule of mixtures as:

$E_{composite}$ = $V_g$ $E_g$ + $V_m$ $E_m$

Substituting the given values, we get:

$E_{composite}$ = (0.2326 x 72.5) + (0.3509 x 2.4)

                     = 16.7485 + 0.84216

                     = 17.5907 GPa

Therefore, the elastic modulus of the composite along the fiber direction is 17.5907 GPa.

Answer: The elastic modulus of the composite along the fiber direction is 17.5907 GPa.
