To find the ideal plastic work of deformation per unit volume, we first need to find the true stress at the given true strain. We use the given flow curve equation:

σ = 200 * ε^(0.25)

Plugging in ε = 0.3, we get:

σ = 200 * (0.3)^(0.25) ≈ 200 * 0.794 ≈ 158.8 MPa

Next, we need to find the plastic work by integrating the flow curve equation with respect to strain over the range of strain from 0 to ε:

Plastic work = ∫(200 * ε^(0.25)) dε

Integrating this equation over the range of strain from 0 to 0.3:

Plastic work = [ (800/1.25) * ε^(1.25) ] from 0 to 0.3

Plugging in ε = 0.3, we get:

Plastic work = (800/1.25) * (0.3)^(1.25) ≈ 640 * 0.453 ≈ 289.92 J/m³

To convert this value to MJ/m³, divide by 1,000,000:

Plastic work ≈ 289.92 / 1,000,000 ≈ 0.00029 MJ/m³

Therefore, the ideal plastic work of deformation per unit volume is approximately 0.00029 MJ/m³.

Answer: [0.00029]
