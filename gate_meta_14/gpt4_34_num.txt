First, we need to use the Nernst equation to calculate the cell potential:

E = E° - (RT/nF) * ln(a_(Cu))

where E is the cell potential, E° is the standard cell potential (which is 0 V for a standard copper-copper cell), R is the universal gas constant (8.314 J/(mol.K)), T is the temperature in Kelvin (25°C = 298 K), n is the valency of copper (divalent, so n = 2), F is the Faraday constant (96500 C/mol), and a_(Cu) is the activity of copper in the anode (0.8).

Plugging in the values:

E = 0 - ((8.314 * 298) / (2 * 96500)) * ln(0.8)

Now, we can calculate the value inside the ln function:

ln(0.8) ≈ -0.2231

And next, we can calculate the entire expression:

E = -((8.314 * 298) / (2 * 96500)) * (-0.2231)

E ≈ 0.01204 V

Now, we need to convert the value to millivolts:

E = 0.01204 * 1000 = 12.04 mV

The absolute value of the cell potential is 12.04 mV.

The answer is [12.04].
