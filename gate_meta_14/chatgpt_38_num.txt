The Tresca yield criterion states that yielding occurs when the difference between any two principal stresses is equal to or greater than the yield strength of the material divided by the factor of safety. In this case, the largest difference between any two principal stresses is 300 MPa (250 MPa - (-50 MPa)). Therefore, we can write:

300 MPa = Yield strength / factor of safety

Assuming a factor of safety of 2, we can solve for the yield strength:

Yield strength = 600 MPa

Therefore, the yield strength of the material, according to the Tresca yield criterion, is 600 MPa.

Answer: [600 MPa]
