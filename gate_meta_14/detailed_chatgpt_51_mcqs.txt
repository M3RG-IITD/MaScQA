The correct answer is:

(C) lower temperature and higher basicity

Explanation:

In order to produce low silicon pig iron in a blast furnace, the following factors are important:

1. Temperature: Lower temperature is preferred for producing low silicon pig iron, as it helps in reducing the formation of silicon carbide, which is a major source of silicon in the pig iron.

2. Basicity: Higher basicity is preferred, as it helps in maintaining a high slag volume, which in turn helps in reducing the contact between the metal and slag phases. This reduces the amount of silicon transferred from the slag to the metal.

Therefore, option (C) - lower temperature and higher basicity - is the correct answer.
