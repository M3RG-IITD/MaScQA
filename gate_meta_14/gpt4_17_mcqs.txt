The stress amplitude is given by the formula:

Stress amplitude = (Maximum stress - Minimum stress) / 2

In this case, the maximum stress is 400 MPa, and the minimum stress is -300 MPa (compression is negative). So,

Stress amplitude = (400 - (-300)) / 2 = (400 + 300) / 2 = 700 / 2 = 350 MPa

The stress amplitude is 350 MPa.

The correct answer is [350].
