To find the activity of Q in the alloy, we need to first find the activity coefficient of Q ($γ_Q$) using the given equation and then calculate the activity using the formula: activity of Q = $𝑥_𝑄 * 𝛾_𝑄$

Given the composition 𝑥_𝑅 = 0.6, we can find the mole fraction of Q (𝑥_𝑄) which is given by:

𝑥_𝑄 = 1 - 𝑥_𝑅 = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4

Now, let's calculate the activity coefficient of Q using the given equation:

ln $γ_Q$ = 0.6*$(𝑥_𝑅)^2$ - 0.2*$(𝑥_𝑅)^3$
ln $γ_Q$ = 0.6*(0.6)^2 - 0.2*(0.6)^3
ln $γ_Q$ = 0.6*0.36 - 0.2*0.216
ln $γ_Q$ = 0.216 - 0.0432
ln $γ_Q$ ≈ 0.1728

Now, to find $γ_Q$, we take the exponent:

$γ_Q = e^{0.1728} ≈ 1.188$

Finally, we calculate the activity of Q using the formula:

activity of Q = 𝑥_𝑄 * 𝛾_𝑄 = 0.4 * 1.188 ≈ 0.4752

So, the activity of Q in the alloy is approximately 0.4752.

The correct answer is [0.4752].
