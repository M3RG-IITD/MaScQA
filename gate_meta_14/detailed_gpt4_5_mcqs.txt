An intensive property is a property that does not depend on the amount or size of the material or system. In other words, an intensive property is a characteristic that stays the same, even when the quantity or size of the material changes. 

Let's examine each option:

A) Temperature: Temperature is an intensive property, because it does not depend on the amount of material. For example, if you have a large container of gas and a small container of gas with the same temperature, dividing the large container into smaller ones will not change the temperature.

B) Pressure: Pressure is also an intensive property. It is the force exerted per unit area and does not depend on the total volume or quantity of the substance. If you break a large pressurized container into smaller containers, the pressure in each smaller container will still be the same as the pressure in the original container.

C) Volume: Volume is an extensive property because it depends on the amount of substance. If you have a large container of gas and a small container of gas, the volume is directly proportional to the amount of gas in each container. If you break a large container into smaller ones, the total volume of the smaller containers will be equal to the volume of the original large container.

D) Refractive index: Refractive index is an intensive property, which is the measure of how light propagates through a material, and it does not depend on the size or amount of the material. Different materials have different refractive indices, but breaking a block of material into smaller pieces doesn't change its refractive index.

From the explanations above, the correct answer is:

[C] Volume - This is the only extensive property in the list.
