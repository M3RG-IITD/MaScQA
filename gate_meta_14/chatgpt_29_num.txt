To find the activity of Q in an alloy of composition 𝑥_𝑅 = 0.6, we need to substitute 𝑥_𝑅 = 0.6 in the given equation and then solve for ln $𝛾_𝑄$.

ln $𝛾_𝑄$ = $0.6*(𝑥_R)^2$ - 0.2*$(𝑥_R)^3$

ln $𝛾_𝑄$ = 0.6*(0.6)^2 - 0.2*(0.6)^3

ln $𝛾_𝑄$ = 0.2592

Now, we need to find the value of $𝛾_𝑄$ by taking the exponential of ln $𝛾_𝑄$.

$𝛾_𝑄$ = e^(0.2592)

$𝛾_𝑄$ = 1.296

Therefore, the activity of Q in an alloy of composition 𝑥_𝑅 = 0.6 at the given temperature is 1.296.

Answer: [1.296]
