Two Cu-Ni alloys, one with 47 wt.% Ni and the other with 53 wt.% Ni, are kept in separate crucibles and are allowed to equilibrate at the same temperature $T_1$ between the liquidus and the solidus. The two alloys have
(A) the same weight fraction of the liquid but the liquid compositions are different. (B) the same composition of the liquid but the weight fractions of the liquid are different. (C) the same weight fractions of the liquid and the solid. (D) different compositions and weight fractions of the liquid
