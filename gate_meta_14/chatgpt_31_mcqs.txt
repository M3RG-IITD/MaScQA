The Burgers vector of the dislocation is [a/2][1 -1 0], which should be resolved into two partials. The two partials have Burgers vector of [a/6][2 -1 1] and [a/6][1 -2 -1]. The plane of the dislocation is given by taking the cross product of the two partials, which equals [1 1 1]. Therefore, the answer is (B) (1 1 1). 

Answer: (B) (1 1 1)
