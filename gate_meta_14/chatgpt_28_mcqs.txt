The position vector `r` in three-dimensional space is given by `r=<x,y,z>`.

The divergence of `r` is defined as the sum of the partial derivatives of its components with respect to their corresponding variables:

`div(r) = (partial x)/ (partial x) + (partial y)/ (partial y) + (partial z)/ (partial z)`

Simplifying this expression, we get:

`div(r) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3`

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 3.
