We have the following parameters:

Crosshead speed = 6 mm/min

Strain rate ($\dot{\epsilon}$) at the start of the testing = 5 * 10^(-3) s^(-1)

We can use the following equation to find the initial gauge length (L0):

$\dot{\epsilon} = \frac{v}{L_0}$

where, v is the crosshead speed and $L_0$ is the initial gauge length.

Plugging in the given values, we get:

5 * 10^(-3) s^(-1) = 6 mm/min / $L_0$

Converting the crosshead speed to mm/s:

6 mm/min = 0.1 mm/s

Substituting this value in the above equation:

5 * 10^(-3) s^(-1) = 0.1 mm/s / $L_0$

Rearranging the above equation, we get:

$L_0 = \frac{0.1 mm/s}{5 * 10^(-3) s^(-1)}$

$L_0$ = 20 mm

Therefore, the initial gauge length of the specimen was 20 mm.
