We will start by matching the alloy names from Group I with the main elements present in them from Group II:

P. Babbit: Babbit is an alloy of metals such as tin, antimony, and copper. So, P matches with 4 (Sn-Sb-Cu).

Q. Muntz metal: Muntz metal is an alloy of copper and zinc. So, Q matches with 3 (Cu-Zn).

R. Invar: Invar is an alloy of iron and nickel. So, R matches with 1 (Fe-Ni).

S. Inconel: Inconel is an alloy of nickel, chromium, and iron. So, S matches with 2 (Ni-Cr-Fe).

Now let's check which option has the correct matching of alloys in Group I and their corresponding elements in Group II:

(A) P-3, Q-1, R-4, S-2 - Incorrect
(B) P-3, Q-4, R-1, S-2 - Incorrect
(C) P-4, Q-1, R-2, S-3 - Incorrect
(D) P-4, Q-3, R-1, S-2 - Correct

Answer: [D]
