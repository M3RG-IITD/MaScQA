The $K_{IC}$ value represents the toughness of a material and can be defined as the amount of stress intensity factor that a material can tolerate before it fails. Higher the $K_{IC}$, higher is the resistance of the material to the growth of a crack.

Given that the $K_{IC}$ of alloy X is greater than that of alloy Y but both components are subjected to the same stress during operation under Mode I loading. This means that if there is a crack in each component, the crack in the component made from alloy Y would grow faster than that in the component made from alloy X. Therefore, the component made from alloy Y can tolerate a smaller flaw size compared to that made from X.

Hence, the correct answer is:

(B) Component made from alloy Y can tolerate a larger flaw size compared to that made from X.
