P: Tungsten is a transition metal and is known to crystallize in a body-centered cubic (BCC) lattice structure. 

Q: Nickel is also a transition metal and is known to crystallize in a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice structure. 

R: Magnesium is an alkaline earth metal and is known to crystallize in a hexagonal close-packed (HCP) lattice structure. 

S: Polonium is a metalloid and is known to crystallize in a simple cubic lattice structure. 

Therefore, the correct matching is: (A) P-2, Q-1, R-4, S-3. 

Explanation: 
- Tungsten (P) is a transition metal and is known to crystallize in a BCC structure (option 3 is eliminated). 
- Nickel (Q) is a transition metal and is known to crystallize in an FCC structure (option 2 is eliminated). 
- Magnesium (R) is an alkaline earth metal and is known to crystallize in a HCP structure (option 1 is eliminated). 
- Polonium (S) is a metalloid and is known to crystallize in a simple cubic structure (option 4 is eliminated).

Therefore, the only option that matches each element with its corresponding crystal structure is (A) P-2, Q-1, R-4, S-3.
