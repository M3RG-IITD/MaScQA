The condition for thermodynamic equilibrium between two phases is that the chemical potential of each component in each phase is equal to the chemical potential of the same component in the other phase.

So, the correct condition for equilibrium is:

(A) $(洧랞_洧논)^洧띺 = $(洧랞_洧녽)^洧띻 and $(洧랞_洧녽)^洧띺 = $(洧랞_洧논)^洧띻

This means that the chemical potential of component 洧논 in phase 洧띺 is equal to the chemical potential of component 洧녽 in phase 洧띻, and the chemical potential of component 洧녽 in phase 洧띺 is equal to the chemical potential of component 洧논 in phase 洧띻.
