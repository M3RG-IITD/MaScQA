The interplanar spacing (d) can be calculated using the following formula:

d = a / √(h² + k² + l²)

where a is the lattice constant, and h, k, and l are the Miller indices of the plane of interest.

For the (111) plane in aluminium, h = k = l = 1 (since it is a cubic crystal), and the lattice constant for aluminium is 4.049 Å.

Substituting these values into the formula:

d = 4.049 Å / √(1² + 1² + 1²)

d = 4.049 Å / √3

d = 4.049 Å / 1.732

d = 2.335 Å

Therefore, the interplanar spacing of (111) planes in aluminium is 2.335 Å.

Answer: [2.335 Å]
