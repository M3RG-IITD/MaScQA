To find the elastic strain that is recovered when the rod is completely unloaded, we can use the formula:

Elastic strain = Stress / Young's Modulus

where,
Stress = 400 MPa
Young's Modulus = 200 GPa

First, we need to convert both the stress and Young's Modulus to the same units. We will convert the Young's Modulus to MPa:

1 GPa = 1000 MPa

So, Young's Modulus = 200 * 1000 = 200,000 MPa

Now, we can calculate the elastic strain:

Elastic strain = Stress / Young's Modulus
Elastic strain = 400 MPa / 200,000 MPa

Elastic strain = 0.002

To find the elastic strain in percentage, we multiply the result by 100:

Elastic strain (%) = 0.002 * 100
Elastic strain (%) = 0.2%

Therefore, the elastic strain that is recovered when the rod is completely unloaded is 0.2%.

Answer: [0.2]
