We know that:
True strain (ε) = ln(final gauge length/initial gauge length)

We have to find the final gauge length. The initial gauge length can be taken as 10 mm (assuming it is not specified in the question).

0.405 = ln(final gauge length/10)

Taking exponential on both sides,

e⁰·⁴⁰⁵ = e^ln(final gauge length/10)

1.5 = final gauge length/10

final gauge length = 15 mm

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 15.
