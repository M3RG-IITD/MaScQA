We can find the elastic modulus of the composite along the fiber direction using the Rule of Mixtures:

E_c = V_f * E_f + V_m * E_m

where E_c is the elastic modulus of the composite, V_f and V_m are the volume fractions of the fiber and matrix, and E_f and E_m are the elastic moduli of the fiber and matrix, respectively.

First, we need to determine the volume fractions of the fiber and matrix. Given the weight percentages, we can find the mass fractions:

Mass fraction of fiber (m_f) = 60 wt.% = 0.60
Mass fraction of matrix (m_m) = 40 wt.% = 0.40

We can convert these mass fractions into volume fractions using the densities of the fiber and matrix:

Volume fraction of fiber (V_f) = (mass fraction of fiber * density of matrix) / (mass fraction of fiber * density of matrix + mass fraction of matrix * density of fiber)

V_f = (0.60 * 1.14 g/cm³) / (0.60 * 1.14 g/cm³ + 0.40 * 2.58 g/cm³)

V_f = 0.684 g/cm³ / (0.684 g/cm³ + 1.032 g/cm³)

V_f = 0.684 / 1.716

V_f = 0.3984

Volume fraction of matrix (V_m) = 1 - Volume fraction of fiber

V_m = 1 - 0.3984

V_m = 0.6016

Now we can plug these values into the Rule of Mixtures equation:

E_c = V_f * E_f + V_m * E_m

E_c = (0.3984 * 72.5 GPa) + (0.6016 * 2.4 GPa)

E_c = 29.034 GPa + 1.44384 GPa

E_c = 30.47784 GPa

So, the elastic modulus of the composite along the fiber direction is approximately 30.48 GPa.

The correct answer is [30.48 GPa].
