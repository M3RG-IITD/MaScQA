We know that the strain rate is defined as the rate at which the specimen is being stretched per unit time. Mathematically, 

Strain rate = Change in length / (Original length * Change in time) 

Given, 

Crosshead speed = 6 mm/min = Change in length / Change in time 

Therefore, 

Change in length = Crosshead speed * Change in time = 6 * 5 * $10^(-3)$ = 0.03 mm/s 

Also, 

Strain rate = 5 * $10^(-3)s^(-1)$ = Change in length / (Original length * Change in time) 

Therefore, 

Original length = Change in length / (Strain rate * Change in time) = (0.03) / (5 * $10^(-3)$ * 1) = 6 mm 

Hence, the initial gauge length of the specimen is 6 mm.
