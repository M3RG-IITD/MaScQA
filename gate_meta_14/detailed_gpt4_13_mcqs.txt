The trapezoidal rule is one of the basic methods for numerical integration, which aims to approximate the definite integral of a function. The main idea of the trapezoidal rule is to approximate the function by a straight line or a linear function within each interval.

Let's consider some details about the trapezoidal rule to understand the nature of the approximation used in each interval.

Given a function f(x) to be integrated over an interval [a, b], the definite integral can be represented by the area under the curve of f(x) in the given interval.

The trapezoidal rule works by dividing the interval [a, b] into n equal sub-intervals, where n is an integer. Each sub-interval has a width of h = (b - a) / n.

Now, within each sub-interval [x_i, x_(i+1)], the trapezoidal rule approximates f(x) by a straight line or a linear function passing through two points (x_i, f(x_i)) and (x_(i+1), f(x_(i+1))). The area under this straight line within the sub-interval [x_i, x_(i+1)] is considered as the approximate area for the actual function f(x).

So, by summing up these areas for all the sub-intervals, we obtain the trapezoidal rule approximation for the definite integral of the function f(x) over the interval [a, b].

Since the function is approximated by a straight line (i.e., a linear function) within each interval, the nature of the approximation used in the trapezoidal rule is linear.

Thus, the correct answer is: [B]
