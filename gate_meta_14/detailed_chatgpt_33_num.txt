The balanced chemical equation for the complete combustion of $CH_4$ is:

$CH_4 + 2O_2 \rightarrow CO_2 + 2H_2O$

From this equation, we can see that 1 mole of $CH_4$ requires 2 moles of $O_2$ for complete combustion. The molar volume of a gas at STP is 22.4 L, so 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 L at STP.

The given volume of $CH_4$ is 100 $m^3$ at STP, which can be converted to moles using the equation:

$n = \dfrac{PV}{RT}$

$n_{CH_4} = \dfrac{(1 \ atm)(100 \ m^3)}{(0.0821 \ L \ atm^{-1} \ mol^{-1})(273 \ K)} = 4145 \ mol$

To completely combust 1 mole of $CH_4$, 2 moles of $O_2$ are needed. Therefore, to completely combust 4145 moles of $CH_4$, we need:

$2 \times 4145 \ mol = 8290 \ mol$ of $O_2$

Air contains 21 vol.% of oxygen, which means that it contains 21/100 = 0.21 moles of $O_2$ for every mole of air. Therefore, the number of moles of air required for combustion can be calculated as:

$n_{air} = \dfrac{8290 \ mol \ O_2}{0.21 \ mol \ O_2/mol \ air} = 39381 \ mol \ air$

Finally, the volume of air required can be calculated using the molar volume at STP:

$V_{air} = n_{air} \times 22.4 \ L/mol = 880,646 \ L = 880.6 \ m^3$

Therefore, the theoretical requirement of air (in $m^3$ at STP) for the complete combustion of 100 $m^3$ (at STP) of pure $CH_4$ is 880.6 $m^3$.

Answer: 

- 880.6 $m^3$
