Given the flow curve equation for the annealed metal:

σ = 200ε^0.25

where σ is the stress in MPa and ε is the true strain.

We are given that the true strain applied on the rod (ε) is 0.3. We will first find the corresponding stress (σ).

Step 1: Find the stress (σ)

Substitute the given value of strain (ε = 0.3) into the flow curve equation:

σ = 200(0.3)^0.25

σ ≈ 149.96 MPa

So, the stress applied on the rod is approximately 149.96 MPa.

Now, we need to calculate the ideal plastic work of deformation per unit volume. The ideal plastic work is given by the product of the stress and the strain.

Step 2: Calculate the ideal plastic work of deformation per unit volume (W)

W = σ * ε

We have found that the stress (σ) is approximately 149.96 MPa and the true strain (ε = 0.3). Substituting these values into the formula:

W = 149.96 * 0.3

W ≈ 44.988 MPa

The ideal plastic work of deformation per unit volume is approximately 44.988 MPa.

Lastly, we need to convert this value to MJ/m^3.

Step 3: Convert MPa to MJ/m^3

1 MPa = 1 N/mm^2 or 1 J/mm^3

We know that 1 mm = 1e-3 m, 

So, 1 J/mm^3 = 1 J / (1e-9 m^3)

1 J/mm^3 = 1e9 J/m^3 = 1e-3 MJ/m^3

Therefore, 1 MPa = 1e-3 MJ/m^3.

Now, we can convert the ideal plastic work of deformation per unit volume to MJ/m^3:

W = 44.988 MPa * (1e-3 MJ/m^3/MPa)

W ≈ 0.044988 MJ/m^3

So, the ideal plastic work of deformation per unit volume is approximately 0.044988 MJ/m^3.

Thus, the correct answer is:

[0.044988]
