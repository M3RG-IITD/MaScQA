Chvorinov's rule states that the solidification time is proportional to the square of the volume-to-surface-area ratio. It is given by the equation:

t = k * (V/A)^n

Where:
- t = solidification time
- k = a constant that depends on the material and cooling characteristics
- V = volume of the casting
- A = surface area of the casting
- n = a constant, typically close to 2.0

As we're given the thickness of the solidified layer after 2 minutes (3 cm) and we have to find the thickness after 4 minutes, we'll set up a proportion.

Let x be the thickness of the solidified layer (in cm) after 4 minutes, V1 be the volume of the solidified layer after 2 minutes, V2 be the volume of the solidified layer after 4 minutes, A1 be the surface area of the solidified layer after 2 minutes, and A2 be the surface area of the solidified layer after 4 minutes.

Since the casting is a rectangular slab, we can represent its volume by V = area * thickness, and its surface area by A = perimeter * thickness.

The ratio of solidification times is equal to the ratio of the squares of the volume-to-surface-area ratios:

t2 / t1 = (V2 / A2)^n / (V1 / A1)^n

We're given t1 = 2 min and t2 = 4 min. Moreover, n ≈ 2:

4 / 2 = (V2 / A2)^2 / (V1 / A1)^2

Substitute x as the thickness after 4 minutes and 3 cm as the thickness after 2 minutes. We can simplify the expression by cancelling out the constant k, the area and perimeter terms, as they are the same for both cases:

2 = (x / 3)^2

Now, we'll solve for x:

2 = x^2 / 9
x^2 = 18
x = sqrt(18)

Thus, the thickness of the solidified layer after 4 minutes is:

x ≈ 4.24 cm

The answer is [4.24].
