The divergence of a position vector is given by the dot product of the gradient operator and the position vector.

In three-dimensional space, the gradient operator is given by:

∇ = i( ∂/∂x ) + j( ∂/∂y ) + k( ∂/∂z )

where i, j and k are the unit vectors along the x, y and z directions, respectively.

The position vector r is given by:

r = xi + yj + zk

where x, y, and z are the coordinates of the point.

Taking the dot product of ∇ and r, we get:

∇ · r = (i( ∂/∂x ) + j( ∂/∂y ) + k( ∂/∂z )) · (xi + yj + zk)

Expanding the dot product, we get:

∇ · r = (∂x/∂x)i · xi + (∂y/∂y)j · yj + (∂z/∂z)k · zk

Since ∂x/∂x = ∂y/∂y = ∂z/∂z = 1, we get:

∇ · r = i · xi + j · yj + k · zk

Taking the magnitude of this expression, we get:

|∇ · r| = | xi + yj + zk |

Since the magnitude of the position vector r is the distance from the origin to the point, we have:

|∇ · r| = √( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 )

This is the magnitude of the divergence of the position vector. Since this expression does not simplify to a constant value, we can conclude that the divergence of the position vector r is not a constant. Therefore, the answer is (E) none of the above.
