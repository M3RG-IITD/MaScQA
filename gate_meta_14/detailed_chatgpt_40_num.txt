Chvorinov's rule states that solidification time is proportional to the square of the volume to surface area ratio. That is:

$$t_s \propto \left(\frac{V}{A}\right)^2$$

We can express this in equation form as:

$$t_s = C \left(\frac{V}{A}\right)^2$$
where C is a constant of proportionality that depends on the material and the casting process.

For a rectangular slab, the volume is given by:

$$V = lwh$$
where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height or thickness of the slab.

The surface area is given by:

$$A = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh$$

The ratio of volume to surface area is then:

$$\frac{V}{A} = \frac{lwh}{2lw + 2lh + 2wh}$$

Let's assume that C is the same for both 2 and 4 minutes (which is not always true, but is a simplification that is often made). Then we can write:

$$t_{s,2} = C \left(\frac{V}{A}\right)^2$$

and

$$t_{s,4} = C \left(\frac{V}{A}\right)^2$$

We are given that the solidified thickness after 2 minutes is 3 cm, which means that the remaining thickness after 2 minutes is h-3. We can set up an equation to solve for h:

$$t_{s,2} = C \left(\frac{lwh}{2lw + 2lh + 2wh}\right)^2 = 2$$

Simplifying this equation gives:

$$h = \frac{6lw}{C} - 2(l+w)$$

The solidified thickness after 4 minutes is given by:

$$t_{s,4} = C \left(\frac{lwh}{2lw + 2lh + 2wh}\right)^2$$

We can substitute the expression we derived for h earlier to get:

$$t_{s,4} = C \left(\frac{lw(6lw/C - 2l - 2w)}{2lw + 2(6lw/C-2l-2w)l + 2(6lw/C-2l-2w)w}\right)^2$$

Simplifying this expression gives:

$$t_{s,4} = \frac{C}{4} \left(\frac{9lw}{2lw + 6l + 6w/C}\right)^2$$

We are not given any information about the length or width of the slab, so we cannot compute an exact answer. However, we can make some general observations. As the volume to surface area ratio increases, the solidification time decreases, so we would expect the solidified thickness after 4 minutes to be less than 3 cm. Additionally, doubling the solidification time quadruples the volume to surface area ratio, so we would expect the solidified thickness after 4 minutes to be less than half of the solidified thickness after 2 minutes (i.e. less than 1.5 cm). Therefore, we can be certain that the correct answer is:

- The solidified thickness (in cm) after 4 minutes is less than 1.5 cm.
