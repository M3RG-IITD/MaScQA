To find the divergence of a position vector relative to the origin in three-dimensional space, we first need to express the position vector r in terms of its Cartesian coordinates, so r = xi + yj + zk, where x, y, and z, are the positions along the x, y, and z axes, respectively.

The divergence is the measure of how quickly the vectors in a vector field spread out from the origin or the rate of change in different directions. We can find the divergence of a vector field by taking the partial derivatives of its components in the respective directions and adding them up.

Divergence of a vector field F(r) = (∂F_x/∂x) + (∂F_y/∂y) + (∂F_z/∂z)

In our case, F(r) = r, so our components are:

F_x = x
F_y = y
F_z = z

Now, we need to find the partial derivatives with respect to x, y, and z.

(∂F_x/∂x) = (∂x/∂x) = 1, since the partial derivative of x with respect to x is 1 (and all other terms are constant and their partial derivatives are 0).

(∂F_y/∂y) = (∂y/∂y) = 1, for the same reason as above.

(∂F_z/∂z) = (∂z/∂z) = 1, again for the same reason.

Adding them all up, we get:

Divergence of r = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

So the divergence of the position vector r relative to the origin in three-dimensional space is 3.

The correct answer is (D) 3.
