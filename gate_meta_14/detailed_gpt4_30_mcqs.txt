Let's solve this question by understanding the information given and analyzing each option step by step.

We have two Cu-Ni alloys, one with 47 wt.% Ni (Alloy 1) and the other with 53 wt.% Ni (Alloy 2). Both alloys are at temperature T1 between liquidus and solidus, meaning they are experiencing a partially molten state with both liquid and solid phases present.

Now, let's evaluate the options one by one:

(A) The same weight fraction of the liquid but the liquid compositions are different.

Since the two alloys have different compositions, it is possible that they could have the same weight fraction of the liquid. However, the composition of the liquid in each alloy would be different due to the initial difference in their compositions (47 wt.% Ni vs. 53 wt.% Ni). 

(B) The same composition of the liquid but the weight fractions of the liquid are different.

It is not possible for the two alloys to have the same composition of the liquid, as they have different starting compositions. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

(C) The same weight fractions of the liquid and the solid.

The two alloys could potentially have the same weight fractions of the liquid and the solid, but it is not guaranteed. The weight fractions of the liquid and the solid would depend on the specific temperature T1 and the phase diagram for the Cu-Ni system. If T1 happens to result in the same weight fractions for both alloys, this option is true. 

(D) Different compositions and weight fractions of the liquid.

Since the two alloys have different starting compositions, their liquid compositions will also be different. The weight fractions of the liquid could be the same or different for the two alloys depending on the temperature T1, as mentioned in option (C). 

Based on the analysis, option (A) is always true for the given situation, while option (C) could be true depending on the specific conditions.

Therefore, the correct answer is [A].
