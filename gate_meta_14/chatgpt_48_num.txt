The interplanar spacing of (111) planes in a crystal is given by the formula:

d = a/sqrt(3)

Where 'a' is the lattice parameter (distance between atoms in a crystal along a particular direction).

For the (111) planes in aluminium, the lattice parameter 'a' can be calculated using the atomic radius 'r' as:
a = 4√2 r

Substituting the given value of atomic radius for aluminium, we get:
a = 4√2(1.431) = 4.049 Å (approx.)

Substituting this value of 'a' in the formula for interplanar spacing, we get:
d = a/sqrt(3) = (4.049)/sqrt(3) = 2.341 Å (approx.)

Therefore, the interplanar spacing of (111) planes in aluminium is 2.341 Å (approx.)

Answer: [2.341 Å]
