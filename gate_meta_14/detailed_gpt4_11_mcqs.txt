Let's analyze each of the given options step by step.

Option A: Conductor to Insulator
- Mercury is a metal and can be considered a good conductor of electricity.
- As we cool down the mercury, its electrical resistivity may increase (since resistivity increases with decreasing temperature in metals, up to a certain point). However, it wouldn't become an insulator at 3 K.

Option B: Semiconductor to Insulator
- Mercury is not a semiconductor, so this option is not correct.

Option C: Conductor to Superconductor
- As mentioned earlier, mercury is a conductor. So the first part of this option is correct.
- Superconductors are materials that exhibit zero electrical resistance below a certain critical temperature. Mercury is actually one of the first elements discovered to have superconducting properties when cooled down to a sufficiently low temperature.
- Mercury becomes a superconductor at around 4.2 K, which is very close to the given temperature of 3 K.

Option D: Semiconductor to Superconductor
- As said before, mercury is not a semiconductor, making this option incorrect.

Based on the analysis, the correct option is (C) conductor to superconductor. So, the answer is:

[Option C]
