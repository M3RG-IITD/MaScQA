P: Grain size strengthening is the method of increasing the number of grain boundaries in a material, making it difficult for dislocations to move through the material. 

Q: Work hardening is the process of straining a material beyond its elastic limit, causing permanent dislocation of the crystal lattice. 

R: Dispersion strengthening is the method of adding tiny particles of a harder material to a softer material, creating a composite material that is stronger than the original. 

S: Solid solution hardening is the method of adding atoms of a dissimilar element to a metal lattice, creating a lattice with fewer dislocation sites. 

1. Orowan looping occurs when a dislocation encounters a hard particle or second-phase precipitate, and must bypass it through a series of looping movements. 

2. Suzuki interaction occurs when a dislocation interacts with a solute atom, causing it to become more difficult for the dislocation to move past that atom. 

3. Lomer-Cottrell barrier occurs when dislocations pile up along grain boundaries and become immobile, obstructing their movement through the material. 

4. Dislocation pileup at grain boundaries is the process where dislocations become pinned at grain boundaries, resulting in an increase in material strength. 

From the above descriptions, it is clear that: 

P - 3 (Lomer-Cottrell barrier)
Q - 4 (Dislocation pileup at grain boundaries)
R - 2 (Suzuki interaction)
S - 1 (Orowan looping)

Therefore, the correct option is (A) P-3, Q-4, R-2, S-1.
