Given, 
- The activity coefficient of Q in a liquid Q-R alloy is represented as: ln $𝛾_𝑄$ = $0.6*(𝑥_R)^2$ - $0.2*(𝑥_R)^3$
- The composition of the alloy is 𝑥_𝑅 = 0.6

To find:
- The activity of Q in the alloy of composition 𝑥_𝑅 = 0.6.

Solution:
The general equation to calculate activity from activity coefficient is: 

$𝑎_𝑄 = 𝜆_𝑄 * 𝑥_𝑄$

where 𝜆_𝑄 is the activity coefficient of Q and 𝑥_𝑄 is the mole fraction of solute Q.

We can rewrite the given equation as:

$𝛾_𝑄  = e^{0.6*(𝑥_R)^2 - 0.2*(𝑥_R)^3}$

At a given temperature, the sum of mole fractions of Q and R in any alloy will be 1.

Hence, mole fraction of solute Q, 𝑥_𝑄 = 1 - 𝑥_𝑅
=> 𝑥_𝑄 = 0.4

Substituting the values in the equation, we get:

$𝛾_𝑄  = e^{0.6*(0.6)^2 - 0.2*(0.6)^3}$

$𝛾_𝑄  = e^{0.1296 - 0.0432}$

$𝛾_𝑄  = e^{0.0864}$

$𝛾_𝑄  = 1.0908$

Therefore, the activity of Q in the alloy of composition 𝑥_𝑅 = 0.6 is 1.0908. 

Answer: [1.0908]
