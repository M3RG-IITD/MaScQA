Given,  
Apparent density of the metal powder = 2.5 g/$cm^3$  
Green density of the metal powder after compaction = 5.5 g/$cm^3$  
Height of the green sample after compaction = 12 mm  

Let's assume the fill height of the powder to be 'H' mm.  
Volume of the cylindrical die = $A\times H$ $cm^3$  ... (where A is the cross-sectional area)  
Volume of the powder filled in the die = $A\times H\times$ 2.5 $cm^3$  
Volume of the green sample = $A\times$ 12 $cm^3$  

We know, green density of the powder = (mass of the powder / volume of the green sample)  
Therefore,  
Mass of the powder = Green density of the powder $\times$ volume of the green sample  
                    = 5.5 g/$cm^3$ $\times$ $A\times$ 12 $cm^3$  
                    = 66$A$ g  

We also know, apparent density of the powder = (mass of the powder / volume of the powder filled)  
Therefore,  
Volume of the powder filled in the die = mass of the powder / apparent density of the powder  
                                                   = 66$A$ g / (2.5 g/$cm^3$)  
                                                   = 26.4$A$ $cm^3$  

Equating the two derived expressions of the volume of the powder, we get:  
$A \times H \times$ 2.5 $cm^3$ = 26.4$A$ $cm^3$  
$H$ = 10.6 mm  

Therefore, the fill height of the powder would have been 10.6 mm.  

Answer: [10.6 mm]
