We are given the true strain (ε) and the change in gauge length (ΔL).

True strain (ε) = 0.405
Change in gauge length (ΔL) = 5 mm

We know that:

True strain = ln(L_final / L_initial)

Where L_final is the final gauge length and L_initial is the initial gauge length. 

To find the final gauge length, we need to determine the initial gauge length. We can rearrange the true strain formula to get:

L_initial = L_final / e^ε

Now, we know that:

L_final - L_initial = ΔL
L_initial = L_final - ΔL

Substitute this into the formula above:

L_final - ΔL = L_final / e^ε

Rearrange to solve for L_final:

L_final * (1 - e^ε) = ΔL
L_final = ΔL / (1 - e^ε)

Now plug in the given values and solve for L_final:

L_final = 5 / (1 - e^0.405)
L_final ≈ 12

So the final gauge length of the specimen is approximately 12 mm. The correct answer is (B) 12.

The answer is: [(B) 12]
