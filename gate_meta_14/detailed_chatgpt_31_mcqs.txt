We start with the given equation:

(a/2)[1 -1 0] â†’ (a/6)[2 -1 1] + (a/6)[1 -2 -1]

Here, the initial dislocation is a type of edge dislocation, described by the [1 -1 0] Burgers vector. The dissociated dislocations are partials, each with an associated Burgers vector of (a/6)[2 -1 1] and (a/6)[1 -2 -1], respectively.

In an FCC crystal, partial dislocations are commonly found on {111} planes. To determine which plane the partial dislocations lie on, we can examine the plane normal to the Burgers vector.

For the first partial dislocation, the plane normal is given by:

(2 -1 1) x (1 0 1) = (1 1 1)

For the second partial dislocation, the plane normal is given by:

(1 -2 -1) x (1 0 1) = (-1 -1 1)

Both of these plane normals are parallel to the {111} planes, but have opposite orientations. Specifically, the first plane normal is [1 1 1], and the second plane normal is [-1 -1 1].

Thus, the two partial dislocations lie on a {111} plane, but with opposite orientations. We can identify this plane as the (1 -1 1) plane, which is perpendicular to the [1 1 1] direction.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(C) (1 -1 1)
