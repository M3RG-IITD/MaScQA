The ability of a material to absorb energy when deformed elastically is called resilience.

Explanation:

Resilience is the ability of a material to store energy when it is deformed elastically, and release that energy upon unloading. This energy storage and release occurs within the elastic limit of the material. Resilience can be calculated as the area under the stress-strain curve up to the elastic limit. 

Toughness is the ability of a material to resist fracture. It is the amount of energy per unit volume that a material can absorb before rupturing. Toughness is a combination of strength and ductility.

Fracture toughness is a measure of a material's resistance to brittle fracture when a crack is present.

Hardness is the ability of a material to resist indentation or scratching. It is a measure of a material's resistance to localized plastic deformation. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Resilience. 

List of answers:
- (A) Toughness
- (B) Fracture toughness
- (C) Resilience
- (D) Hardness
