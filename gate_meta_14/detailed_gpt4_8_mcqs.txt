The Pilling-Bedworth ratio is defined as (B) the volume of the oxide divided by the volume of the metal consumed in oxide formation.

Here's a step-by-step explanation on how to arrive at this answer:

1. Understand the purpose of the Pilling-Bedworth ratio: The Pilling-Bedworth ratio is a concept in materials science that deals with the oxidation of metals. It is used to predict whether an oxide film will protect the underlying metal against further oxidation or not.

2. Consider each option (A to D) individually and compare it with the purpose of the Pilling-Bedworth ratio:

   (A) Molar weight of the oxide divided by the molar weight of the metal consumed in oxide formation - This does not help in understanding the change in volume upon oxidation, which is one of the key factors in determining the protecting ability of the oxide film.

   (B) Volume of the oxide divided by the volume of the metal consumed in oxide formation - This directly deals with the change in volume upon oxidation. A Pilling-Bedworth ratio close to 1 indicates that the oxide film formed fits the metal surface well and provides protection against further oxidation.

   (C) Density of the oxide divided by the density of the metal consumed in oxide formation - Though this option deals with the density of the materials, it does not consider the amounts of metal and oxide involved in the formation process. Hence, it does not give a clear relation between the oxide film and its protective nature.

   (D) Molar Gibbs energy of the oxide divided by the Gibbs energy of the metal consumed in oxide formation - This option deals with the thermodynamics of the oxidation reaction, but it does not provide information about the structural relationship between the oxide film formed and the underlying metal, which is necessary in determining the protective nature of the film.

3. Based on the evaluations of each option, we can conclude that the Pilling-Bedworth ratio is defined as (B) the volume of the oxide divided by the volume of the metal consumed in oxide formation.

The correct answer is [B].
