To find the initial gauge length, we can use the formula:

Strain rate = (Change in length) / (Initial gauge length × time)

We have the strain rate (5 * $10^(-3)s^(-1)$) and crosshead speed (6 mm/min). First, we need to convert the crosshead speed to mm/s:

6 mm/min * (1 min / 60 s) = 0.1 mm/s

Now we can set up the equation:

5 * $10^(-3)s^(-1)$ = (0.1 mm/s) / (Initial gauge length × 1 s)

Solving for the initial gauge length:

Initial gauge length = (0.1 mm/s) / (5 * $10^(-3)s^(-1)$)
Initial gauge length = 0.1 / 5 * $10^(-3)$
Initial gauge length = 100 / 5
Initial gauge length = 20 mm

So the initial gauge length of the specimen is 20 mm.
