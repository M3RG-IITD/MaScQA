The elastic modulus of a composite along the fiber direction can be calculated using the rule of mixtures:

$$E_c = V_f E_f + V_m E_m$$

where $E_c$ is the elastic modulus of the composite, $V_f$ is the volume fraction of the fiber, $V_m$ is the volume fraction of the matrix, $E_f$ is the elastic modulus of the fiber, and $E_m$ is the elastic modulus of the matrix.

First, we need to calculate the volume fraction of the fiber:

$$V_f = \frac{60}{100} = 0.6$$

Similarly, we can calculate the volume fraction of the matrix:

$$V_m = 1 - V_f = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4$$

Now we can plug in the values for $V_f$, $V_m$, $E_f$, and $E_m$:

$$E_c = 0.6(72.5\text{ GPa}) + 0.4(2.4\text{ GPa}) = 43.5\text{ GPa} + 0.96\text{ GPa} = \boxed{44.46\text{ GPa}}$$
