We are given two Cu-Ni alloys, one with 47 wt.% Ni and the other with 53 wt.% Ni, and they are equilibrated at the same temperature T1 between liquidus and solidus. We need to find whether the two alloys have (A) the same weight fraction of the liquid but the liquid compositions are different, (B) the same composition of the liquid but the weight fractions of the liquid are different, (C) the same weight fractions of the liquid and the solid, or (D) different compositions and weight fractions of the liquid.

Let's assume a hypothetical situation where we have one kg of each alloy. Therefore, the 47 wt.% Ni alloy will have 0.47 kg of Ni and 0.53 kg of Cu, whereas the 53 wt.% Ni alloy will have 0.53 kg of Ni and 0.47 kg of Cu.

Since the alloys are equilibrated at the same temperature T1 between the liquidus and the solidus, we can assume that both alloys are in a two-phase equilibrium state of liquid and solid phases. Let's assume that x1 and x2 are the weight fractions of the liquid phase in alloys 1 and 2, respectively.

Now, we can write the mass balance equation for Ni and Cu as follows:

$0.47\times0.5+Ni_{liq,1}\times x_1=Ni_{sol,1}\times(1-x_1)+Ni_{liq,1}\times(1-x_1)$         .......(i)

$0.53\times0.5+Ni_{liq,2}\times x_2=Ni_{sol,2}\times(1-x_2)+Ni_{liq,2}\times(1-x_2)$         .......(ii)

Here, 0.5 is the weight fraction of Ni and Cu in the solid phase of each alloy.

Since both alloys are equilibrated at the same temperature and have the same liquidus and solidus, we can assume that the two liquid phases will have the same composition. Therefore, we can write:

$Ni_{liq,1}\times x_1=Ni_{liq,2}\times x_2$                        .......(iii)

From equations (i) and (ii), we can write:

$Ni_{sol,1}=0.47-0.47\times x_1+Ni_{liq,1}\times (1-x_1)$

$Ni_{sol,2}=0.53-0.53\times x_2+Ni_{liq,2}\times (1-x_2)$

Substituting equation (iii) into these equations, we get:

$Ni_{sol,1}=0.47-0.47\times x_1+Ni_{liq,2}\times (1-x_1)$

$Ni_{sol,2}=0.53-0.53\times x_2+Ni_{liq,1}\times (1-x_2)$

Now, we have two equations with two unknowns (x1 and x2). By solving these equations, we can get the values of x1 and x2. However, we can also use common sense and think about the physical importance of these variables.

We know that the two alloys have different compositions, which means that the activities of Ni and Cu in the liquid phase of the two alloys will be different. Therefore, to maintain the same liquid composition, the weight fractions of the liquid phases in the two alloys should be different. This means that option (B) is correct, which states that the two alloys have the same composition of the liquid but the weight fractions of the liquid are different.

Therefore, the answer is:

(B) the same composition of the liquid but the weight fractions of the liquid are different.
