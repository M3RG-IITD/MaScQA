The process performed for inclusion modification in ladle metallurgy of steelmaking is Calcium wire injection. 

Here's a detailed explanation:

In order to improve the quality of the steel produced in a steelmaking process, various modifications are performed in the ladle before casting. One of such modifications is the inclusion modification which aims to reduce the number and size of non-metallic inclusions present in the steel.

Calcium wire injection is the process used for inclusion modification in ladle metallurgy of steelmaking. In this process, a wire made of pure calcium or a calcium alloy is injected into the molten steel in the ladle. The high temperature of the molten steel causes the calcium to react with the non-metallic inclusions present in the steel, forming calcium oxide and calcium sulfide, which are more easily removed from the molten steel.

The calcium wire is typically injected through a submerged entry nozzle (SEN) which is situated at the bottom of the ladle. The wire is fed into the SEN using a wire feeding machine and the injection rate is controlled to ensure that the appropriate amount of calcium is added to the ladle.

Aluminum wire injection is sometimes used in steelmaking for deoxidation of the molten steel, while oxygen top blowing and oxygen bottom blowing are used for refining the steel.

In summary, the correct answer is:

(B) Calcium wire injection
