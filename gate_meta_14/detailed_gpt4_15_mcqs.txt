To answer this question, let's first understand what $K_{IC}$ is and how it relates to the materials and their performance. $K_{IC}$, also known as the fracture toughness, is a measure of a material's resistance to crack propagation. In other words, it indicates how well a material can withstand a crack or flaw without fracturing. 

Now let's analyze the given information:

1. Two identical engineering components are made from alloys X and Y.
2. The $K_{IC}$ of alloy X is greater than that of alloy Y.
3. Both components are subjected to the same stress during operation under Mode I loading.

Mode I loading is also known as opening mode loading, where the stress applied is perpendicular to the crack plane.

Since alloy X has a higher $K_{IC}$ than alloy Y, it means that alloy X is more resistant to crack propagation than alloy Y. This means that alloy X can tolerate a larger flaw size without fracturing compared to alloy Y.

Under the same stress and Mode I loading, the component made from alloy X can indeed tolerate a larger flaw size compared to that made from alloy Y.

Answer: (A) Component made from alloy X can tolerate a larger flaw size compared to that made from Y.
