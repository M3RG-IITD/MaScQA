Given: 

Young's modulus, Y = 200 GPa = $2\times10^{11}$ Pa

Stress, $\sigma$ = 400 MPa = $4\times10^8$ Pa

Elastic strain, $\epsilon$ = ?

We know that Young's modulus is given by the formula:

$Y = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon}$

Solving for $\epsilon$:

$\epsilon = \frac{\sigma}{Y}$

$\epsilon = \frac{4\times10^8}{2\times10^{11}}$

$\epsilon = 2\times10^{-3}$

Therefore, the elastic strain is 0.2%, or 2/1000. 

Answer: [0.2%]
