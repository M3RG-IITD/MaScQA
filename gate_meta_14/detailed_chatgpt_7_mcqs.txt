(A) Deep drawing is the metal forming process that is associated with the earing defect.

Earing is a common defect that occurs during the deep drawing process of metals such as aluminum, copper, brass, and silver. It is characterized by the formation of an irregular pattern of wavy lines or ripples that form around the circumference of the cup-shaped part during drawing.

The earing defect occurs due to the anisotropic behavior of the metal, which means that the metal has different mechanical properties in different directions. The crystal orientation of the metal can cause directional differences in its mechanical properties, particularly in its ability to deform.

The earing defect can be minimized by orienting the crystal structure of the metal in a specific direction during the rolling process, which is known as the rolling texture. This is achieved by controlling the rolling direction and temperature, and by using a lubricant to control the flow of the material during the drawing process.

Therefore, the correct answer is: 

- (A) Deep drawing
