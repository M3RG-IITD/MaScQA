To solve this problem, we'll first need to understand the relationship between true strain, original length, and final length.

True strain (ε) is defined as the natural logarithm of the ratio of final length (Lf) to the original length (L0). Mathematically, this is expressed as:

ε = ln(Lf / L0)

We are given the true strain (ε) as 0.405 and the change in gauge length as 5 mm. We'll use these two pieces of information to determine the final gauge length (Lf).

Step 1: Determine the relationship between original and final gauge length

We know that the change in the gauge length is 5 mm, which can be expressed as:

Change in gauge length = Lf - L0

So, the relationship between the original and final gauge lengths is:

Lf = L0 + 5

Step 2: Calculate the original gauge length (L0)

We'll now use the true strain formula and the relationship between original and final gauge lengths to calculate the original gauge length (L0). 

First, we'll express L0 in terms of Lf:

L0 = Lf - 5

Now, we'll substitute this expression for L0 in the true strain formula:

ε = ln(Lf / (Lf - 5))

We know that ε = 0.405, so:

0.405 = ln(Lf / (Lf - 5))

Step 3: Solve for the final gauge length (Lf)

To solve for Lf, we'll first need to get rid of the natural logarithm. We can do this by taking the exponential of both sides of the equation:

e^0.405 = e^ln(Lf / (Lf - 5))

Simplifying this equation, we get:

e^0.405 = Lf / (Lf - 5)

Now, we'll multiply both sides by (Lf - 5) to isolate Lf:

(Lf - 5) * e^0.405 = Lf

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

Lf * e^0.405 - 5 * e^0.405 = Lf

Now, to solve for Lf, we'll move all the terms with Lf to one side of the equation:

Lf * e^0.405 - Lf = 5 * e^0.405

Factor out Lf:

Lf * (e^0.405 - 1) = 5 * e^0.405

Now, we'll divide by the factor in the parentheses to solve for Lf:

Lf = (5 * e^0.405) / (e^0.405 - 1)

Using a calculator, we find that:

Lf ≈ 12.007

The final gauge length of the specimen is approximately 12 mm, which is closest to option B (12).
