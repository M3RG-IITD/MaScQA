Chvorinov's rule states that the solidification time for a casting is proportional to the volume-to-surface area ratio. 

Let's denote the thickness of the solidified layer after 4 minutes as "x". We know that the ratio of solidification times is 4/2 = 2. 

So we can write:

(time for thickness x) / (time for thickness 3) = (Volume / Surface Area) for thickness x / (Volume / Surface Area) for thickness 3 

Since the casting is a rectangular slab, we can assume that the volume and surface area are proportional to the length (L), width (W), and thickness (T) of the casting. So we can write:

(time for thickness x) / 2 = (LWT) / (LT + 2LW) for thickness x / (LWT) / (LT + 2LW) for thickness 3

Simplifying this expression, we get:

(time for thickness x) / 2 = x / 3^2

Cross-multiplying and solving for "x", we get:

x = 2 * 3^2 / 4 = 4.5 cm 

Therefore, the solidified thickness after 4 minutes is 4.5 cm.
