The condition for thermodynamic equilibrium between two phases 洧띺 and 洧띻 containing components x and y states that the chemical potential of each component must be the same in both phases. In other words, the chemical potential of component x in phase 洧띺 must be equal to the chemical potential of component x in phase 洧띻, and the chemical potential of component y in phase 洧띺 must be equal to the chemical potential of component y in phase 洧띻.

Mathematically, this condition can be written as:

$(洧랞_洧논)^洧띺 = $(洧랞_洧논)^洧띻$
$(洧랞_洧녽)^洧띺 = $(洧랞_洧녽)^洧띻$

Comparing these expressions to the provided answer choices, we can see that they match with option (C):

$(洧랞_洧논)^洧띺 = $(洧랞_洧논)^洧띻$ and $(洧랞_洧녽)^洧띻 = $(洧랞_洧녽)^洧띺$

So the correct answer is [C].
