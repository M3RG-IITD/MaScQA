We can use the Stefan-Boltzmann Law to determine the rate of heat transfer from the droplet to the gas stream:

$Q = \frac{4 \pi r^2 \sigma (T_s^4 - T_\infty^4)}{\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}(1-\epsilon)\frac{T_s^2+T_\infty^2}{T_sT_\infty}}$

where $Q$ is the rate of heat transfer (in W), $r$ is the radius of the droplet (0.5 mm), $\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant (5.67 x 10^-8 W m^-2 K^-4), $T_s$ is the surface temperature of the droplet (900 K), $T_\infty$ is the temperature of the gas stream (300 K), and $\epsilon$ is the emissivity of the droplet (assumed to be 1).

The rate of heat transfer is related to the rate of solidification by the enthalpy of fusion:

$\frac{dM}{dt} = \frac{Q}{\Delta H_f}$

where $dM/dt$ is the rate of solidification (in kg/s) and $\Delta H_f$ is the enthalpy of fusion (4,000 kJ/kg).

The mass of the droplet can be calculated from its density and volume:

$M = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \rho$

where $\rho$ is the density of the liquid metal (2,700 kg/m^3).

Combining these equations and integrating from $t=0$ to $t=t_s$ (the time to complete solidification), we get:

$t_s = \frac{3 \rho r^3}{4 \Delta H_f} \int_0^{M_0} \frac{\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}(1-\epsilon)\frac{T_s^2+T_\infty^2}{T_sT_\infty}}{T_s^4 - T_\infty^4} dM$

where $M_0$ is the initial mass of the droplet.

Substituting in all the values, we get:

$t_s = 7.2 s$

Therefore, the time to complete solidification is 7.2 seconds. 

Answer: 
- 7.2 s
