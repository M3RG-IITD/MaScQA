The correct sequence of microstructures observed from the quenched end of the specimen in a Jominy end-quench test of the eutectoid plain-carbon steel is:

(C) Coarse Pearlite, Pearlite and Martensite, Fine Pearlite, Martensite

Explanation:

During the Jominy end-quench test of the eutectoid plain-carbon steel, a specimen is heated to above its upper critical temperature and then rapidly quenched from one end by spraying water. The quenching results in an extreme temperature gradient across the specimen, leading to different rates of cooling and formation of different microstructures.

The microstructure sequence from the quenched end of the specimen includes:

1. Martensite: The outer layer of the specimen cools rapidly and forms martensite, which is a hard and brittle phase with a needle-like or plate-like structure.

2. Pearlite and Martensite: Further inside the specimen, the cooling rate is slower, leading to the formation of pearlite, which is a mixture of ferrite and cementite layers. In between the pearlite layers, there may be some regions with untransformed austenite that transforms into martensite during cooling.

3. Fine Pearlite: At a greater distance from the quenched end, the cooling rate is slow enough to allow for the formation of finer pearlite, which has a higher concentration of cementite.

4. Coarse Pearlite: Further towards the center of the specimen, the cooling rate is even slower, leading to the formation of coarser pearlite, which has a higher concentration of ferrite.

Therefore, the correct sequence of microstructures observed from the quenched end of the specimen in a Jominy end-quench test of the eutectoid plain-carbon steel is Coarse Pearlite, Pearlite and Martensite, Fine Pearlite, Martensite (option C).
