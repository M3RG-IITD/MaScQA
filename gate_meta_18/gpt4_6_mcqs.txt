We need to use the Henry's Law formulation for the gas-liquid equilibrium. For carbon monoxide, we can write the law as:

p(CO) = Kₕ * wt.%C * wt.%O

Where Kₕ is a constant. Based on the given information, we can first find the value of Kₕ:

1 atm = Kₕ * 0.002
Kₕ = 1/0.002 = 500

Now, when p(CO) = 0.1 atm, we can use the found value of Kₕ to calculate the new value of K:

0.1 atm = 500 * K_new
K_new = 0.1/500 = 0.0002

So, the new value of K is 0.0002.

Correct answer: [(D) 0.0002]
