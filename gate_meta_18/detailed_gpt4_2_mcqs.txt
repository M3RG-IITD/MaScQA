Given the melt $2CaO.SiO_2$, let's first analyze the components of this compound.

The compound contains $2 CaO$ and $1 SiO_2$. 

Now, let's write the ionization reactions of each oxide:

1. $CaO:  CaO \rightarrow Ca^{2+} + O^{2-}$

2. $SiO_2: SiO_2 + O^{2-} \rightarrow (SiO_4)^{4-}$

Now, consider the amount of each ion formed in the melt.
 
1. For every 2 moles of $CaO$, there will be $2 \times Ca^{2+}$ ions and $2 \times O^{2-}$ ions formed.

2. For every 1 mole of $SiO_2$, there will be $1 \times (SiO_4)^{4-}$ ion formed.

The sum of the bound negative charges of silicon ions $(SiO_4)^{4-}$ must be equal to the sum of the bound positive charges of calcium ions $Ca^{2+}$, since the electroneutrality principle states that a melt must be electrically neutral.

Let's denote the number of moles of $CaO$ as $x$ (where $x=2$ in this case, but it's not crucial for our problem). Therefore, we can write the following equation considering the charges:

$ \text{(sum of charges of all} \ (SiO_4)^{4-}  \text{ions)} = \text{(sum of charges of all } Ca^{2+} \text{ ions)} \\
4 \times (SiO_4)^{4-} \text{(1 mole)} = 2 \times x \times Ca^{2+} \text{(2 moles)} $

Now, we can solve this for the number of moles of $(SiO_4)^{-4}$ ions:

$4 \times (SiO_4)^{4-} = 4 \times Ca^{2+} \\
(SiO_4)^{4-} = Ca^{2+}$

So, we have the same number of moles of $(SiO_4)^{-4}$ ions as of $Ca^{2+}$ ions in the melt. Importantly it means, that there are no other silicon anions in the melt.

Thus, the most abundant anion in the $2CaO.SiO_2$ melt is $(SiO_4)^{-4}$.
