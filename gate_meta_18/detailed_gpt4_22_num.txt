Unfortunately, there's no diagram given for me to analyze. However, I can provide a general step-by-step approach to solving this problem, assuming that a diagram is provided.

1. Locate the 16% B composition point on the x-axis of the phase diagram: Find the point on the horizontal axis that corresponds to the 16% B composition, which means the alloy is 84% A and 16% B.

2. Determine the solidus and liquidus temperatures for the 16% B composition:
   a. Locate the point where the horizontal line corresponding to 16% B intersects the solidus line (the lower line in the eutectic phase diagram). This point represents the beginning of the melting process for the 16% B alloy.
   b. Similarly, locate the point where the horizontal line corresponding to 16% B intersects the liquidus line (the upper line in the eutectic phase diagram). This point represents the complete melting point of the 16% B alloy.

3. Read the temperatures corresponding to these intersection points:
   a. Read the temperature on the vertical axis corresponding to the point where the 16% B line intersects the solidus line. This is the initial melting temperature, T_solidus, of the 16% B alloy.
   b. Read the temperature on the vertical axis corresponding to the point where the 16% B line intersects the liquidus line. This is the complete melting temperature, T_liquidus, of the 16% B alloy.

4. Calculate the freezing range: Subtract the initial melting temperature (T_solidus) from the complete melting temperature (T_liquidus). Make sure to round the result to one decimal place as requested in the problem.

Freezing range = T_liquidus - T_solidus

5. Write the answer in a list: Put the calculated freezing range into a list as the final answer.

Please review the diagram provided and follow these steps to find the freezing range of the alloy with 16% B.
