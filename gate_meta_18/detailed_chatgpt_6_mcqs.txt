From the given data, (wt.%C)(wt.%O) = K, which is constant. 

According to Henry's law, the concentration of a gas dissolved in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of the gas above the liquid, provided that no chemical reaction takes place.

At 1550 Â°C, the equilibrium reaction for the decarburization of steel can be written as:

$\text{C}_{(s)}+\text{CO}_{2 (g)}\leftrightarrow 2\text{CO}_{(g)}$

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is given by:

$K_{eq} = \frac{(P_{CO})^2}{P_{CO_2}}$

Given that $P_{CO} = 0.1$ atm and $K = 0.002$ when $P_{CO} = 1$ atm, we can use the following equation to find the value of K when $P_{CO} = 0.1$ atm:

$K = \frac{(P_{CO})^2}{P_{CO_2}} \times (wt.\%C)(wt.\%O)$

$0.002 = \frac{(1)^2}{P_{CO_2}} \times (wt.\%C)(wt.\%O)$

$P_{CO_2} = \frac{(wt.\%C)(wt.\%O)}{0.002}$

Now, we can use Henry's law to relate the concentrations of CO and CO2 to their partial pressures:

$[CO_2] = K_H \times P_{CO_2}$

$[CO] = K_H \times P_{CO}$

where $K_H$ is the Henry's law constant.

As no chemical reaction takes place between CO and CO2, the total pressure can be related to the partial pressures of the two gases:

$P_{total} = P_{CO} + P_{CO_2}$

Therefore,

$K_{eq} = \frac{(P_{CO})^2}{P_{CO_2}} = \frac{[CO]^2}{[CO_2]} = \frac{(K_H \times P_{CO})^2}{K_H \times P_{CO_2}} = \frac{(K_H \times P_{CO})^2}{K_H \times (wt.\%C)(wt.\%O)/0.002}$

Simplifying this equation and substituting the given values, we get:

$0.002 = \frac{(K_H \times 0.1)^2}{K_H \times (wt.\%C)(wt.\%O)/0.002}$

$K_H = \frac{0.002 \times (wt.\%C)(wt.\%O)}{(0.1)^2}$

$K_H = 2 \times (wt.\%C)(wt.\%O)$

Substituting this value of $K_H$ in the equation for $P_{CO_2}$:

$P_{CO_2} = \frac{(wt.\%C)(wt.\%O)}{0.002 \times 2} = \frac{(wt.\%C)(wt.\%O)}{0.004}$

Therefore, when $P_{CO} = 0.1$ atm, (wt.%C)(wt.%O) = $K = 0.002 \times 0.004 = 0.0008$.

Hence, the correct answer is (D) 0.0002.
