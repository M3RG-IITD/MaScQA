Given: The enthalpy of fusion for the metal is 4000 kJ $kg^(-1)$ ; The gas-droplet convective heat transfer coefficient is 200 W $m^(-2)K^(-1)$. ; Density of liquid metal is 2700 kg $m^(-3)$. A spherical liquid metal droplet of diameter 1 mm is solidified in a stream of gas at 300 K. Assuming that the metal droplet remains at its melting point of 900 K and neglecting radiative losses, the time(in seconds to one decimal place) to complete the solidification is?
