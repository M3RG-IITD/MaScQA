We start the problem by writing a balanced equation for the reaction:
$$
Fe_2O_3 + 3C + \frac{1}{2}O_2 \longrightarrow 2Fe + 3CO
$$
We can see from the stoichiometry of this equation that for every mole of Fe produced, we need 3 moles of C and $\frac{1}{2}$ mole of $O_2$. We also know that the molar ratio of CO to $CO_2$ in the exit gas is 1:1. This means that if we consume $x$ moles of CO, we also produce $x$ moles of $CO_2$. Let's assume that we produce $y$ moles of Fe, then we consume $3y$ moles of C and $\frac{1}{2}y$ moles of $O_2$ in the reaction. We also produce $3y$ moles of CO and $y$ moles of $CO_2$. The total moles of gas in the exit stream is therefore $4y$. Since the ratio of CO to $CO_2$ is 1:1, we know that half of the moles of gas in the exit stream must be $CO_2$, so $2y$ moles of $CO_2$ are produced. This means that the remaining $2y$ moles of gas must be $CO$. Since we consumed $3y$ moles of C in the reaction, we know that $3y = 2x$, or $x = \frac{3}{2}y$. This means that the moles of $O_2$ consumed is $\frac{1}{2}y$. We can solve for $y$ by using the fact that we produced 2 moles of Fe for every 3 moles of C:
$$
y \text{ moles of Fe} \longrightarrow 3y \text{ moles of C} \longrightarrow 4y \text{ moles of gas}
$$
We know that the mole fraction of $CO_2$ in the gas is $\frac{2y}{4y} = \frac{1}{2}$. The total mole fraction of gas must be 1, so the mole fraction of $CO$ is also $\frac{1}{2}$. We can now write the mole fraction of each gas in terms of $y$ and the total number of moles of gas:
\begin{align*}
CO &: \frac{1}{2} = \frac{2y}{4y} = \frac{y}{2y} = \frac{y}{2(y + \frac{1}{2}y)} \\
CO_2 &: \frac{1}{2} = \frac{2y}{4y} = \frac{y}{2y} = \frac{y}{2(y + \frac{1}{2}y)} \\
O_2 &: \text{unknown} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}y}{4y} = \frac{y}{8y} = \frac{y}{2(y + \frac{1}{2}y)}
\end{align*}
We can see that the mole fraction of $O_2$ is $\frac{1}{4}$ of the mole fraction of $CO$ and $CO_2$. Therefore, the mole fraction of $O_2$ is:
$$
\frac{1}{4}\left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{4}
$$
This means that the mole fraction of $O_2$ in the gas stream is $\frac{1}{4}$. Since we produced $y$ moles of Fe, we consumed $\frac{1}{2}y$ moles of $O_2$. Therefore, we consumed $\frac{1}{2}\times\frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{8}$ mole of $O_2$ for every mole of Fe produced. The correct answer is (A) 1.035.
