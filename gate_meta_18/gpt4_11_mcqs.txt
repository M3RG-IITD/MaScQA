By using the Gibbs phase rule, we can find the maximum number of phases at equilibrium. The phase rule states:

P + F = C + 2

where P is the number of phases, F is the number of degrees of freedom, and C is the number of components. Given that the system is at constant pressure, we have one less degree of freedom, so the equation becomes:

P + F - 1 = C + 2 - 1

Now, solve for the maximum number of phases:

P = C + 1

Since we have a three-component system (C = 3), we can find the maximum number of phases:

P = 3 + 1 = 4

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 4.
