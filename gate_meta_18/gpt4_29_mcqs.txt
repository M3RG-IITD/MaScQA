To determine the behavior of the glass fiber under the given tensile stress, we can use the Griffith's criterion for brittle fracture. Griffith's criterion states that a material will undergo brittle fracture when the stress applied is greater than the critical stress, which can be calculated using the following formula:

σ_critical = sqrt(2 * E * γ / π * a)

Where:
σ_critical = critical stress for brittle fracture
E = elastic modulus of the material
γ = surface energy of the material
a = flaw length. 

Given the elastic modulus (E) = 70 GPa = 70 * 10^9 Pa
Surface energy (γ) = 0.3 J/m²

Since the glass fiber contains a population of flaws of different lengths, we do not have a specific flaw length. However, if the tensile stress applied (20 MPa) is greater than the critical stress for any of the flaws, then the fiber will undergo brittle fracture.

Let's assume the maximum possible critical stress for the glass fiber (σ_critical_max) corresponds to the smallest flaw length (a_min):

σ_critical_max = sqrt( 2 * 70 * 10^9 * 0.3 / (π * a_min) )

To prevent brittle fracture, the tensile stress (20 MPa) must be smaller than the maximum critical stress:

20 * 10^6 < sqrt( 2 * 70 * 10^9 * 0.3  / (π * a_min) )

From this inequality, we can find the minimum flaw length (a_min) for which the fiber will not undergo brittle fracture:

a_min > (2 * 70 * 10^9 * 0.3) / (π * (20 * 10^6)^2) ≈ 1.49e-10 m

Since the glass fiber has a population of flaws with different lengths, it is reasonable to assume that there will be flaws with lengths smaller than the calculated minimum length (a_min). Therefore, it is likely that the fiber will undergo brittle fracture, which corresponds to answer choice (A).

So the correct answer is:

["(A) The fibre will undergo brittle fracture"]
