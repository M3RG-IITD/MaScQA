The energy barrier for homogeneous nucleation is given by the expression:

ΔG = (16π/3)γ^3/(ΔHv^2)

where γ is the interfacial energy, ΔHv is the latent heat of fusion, and the superscript 2 refers to the squared critical radius.

If γ increases by 10%, the energy barrier would change by:

ΔΔG = (16π/3)(1.1γ)^3/[(ΔHv)^2] - (16π/3)γ^3/(ΔHv^2)

Simplifying this expression and dividing by the original barrier, we get:

ΔΔG/ΔG = 3(1.1^3 - 1)/(1.1^3) ≈ 0.21 = 21%

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 21%.
