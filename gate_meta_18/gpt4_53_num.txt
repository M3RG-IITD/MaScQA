To find the entropy change, we will first determine the final temperature of the two pieces of copper when they reach thermal equilibrium. Since the system is isolated, the heat lost by the hotter piece of copper will be equal to the heat gained by the colder piece of copper.

Let the final temperature be Tf.

For the 1 mol piece of copper at 400 K:
Heat lost = mass * specific heat capacity * (Initial temperature - Tf)
= 1 mol * 22.6 J $K^(-1)mol^(-1)$ * (400 K - Tf)

For the 1 mol piece of copper at 300 K:
Heat gained = mass * specific heat capacity * (Tf - initial temperature)
= 1 mol * 22.6 J $K^(-1)mol^(-1)$ * (Tf - 300 K)

Equating heat lost and heat gained to find Tf:
1 * 22.6 * (400 - Tf) = 1 * 22.6 * (Tf - 300)
→ 400 - Tf = Tf - 300
→ Tf = 350 K

Now, we'll find the entropy change:
Entropy change = mass * specific heat capacity * ln(final temperature / initial temperature)

For the 1 mol piece of copper initially at 400 K:
ΔS1 = 1 * 22.6 * ln(350 / 400)

For the 1 mol piece of copper initially at 300 K:
ΔS2 = 1 * 22.6 * ln(350 / 300)

Total entropy change (ΔStotal) = ΔS1 + ΔS2
ΔStotal = 1 * 22.6 * ln(350 / 400) + 1 * 22.6 * ln(350 / 300)

Now, we'll find the values and round to three decimal places:
ΔStotal = 1 * 22.6 * ln(0.875) + 1 * 22.6 * ln(1.167)
ΔStotal = -3.363 + 3.646
ΔStotal = 0.283 J $K^(-1)$

So, the total entropy change for this process is 0.283 J $K^(-1)$. The correct answer is [0.283].
