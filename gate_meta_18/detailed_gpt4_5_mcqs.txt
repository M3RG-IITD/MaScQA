In an integrated steel plant, the correct sequence of operations is as follows:

1. Blast Furnace (BF): In this step, raw materials such as iron ore, coke, and limestone are melted together, resulting in pig iron which contains both iron and some impurities.

2. Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF): The pig iron from the BF is transferred to the BOF, where it is further processed to create steel. Oxygen is blown into the furnace to eliminate impurities, such as carbon, and convert the pig iron into steel.

3. Ladle Furnace Process (LF): Next, the steel from the BOF is transferred to the ladle furnace to undergo secondary refining. This process helps to adjust the steel's chemical composition by adding alloys, and also helps maintain the correct temperature and homogeneity of the molten steel.

4. Ruhrstahl Heraeus Degassing Process (RH): Finally, the molten steel from the ladle furnace undergoes the RH degassing process. During this step, hydrogen, nitrogen, and other unwanted gases are removed from the steel by means of vacuum treatment, thereby improving its quality and ensuring a cleaner final product.

So, the correct sequence is BF→BOF→LF→RH.

Answer: (D) BF→BOF→LF→RH
