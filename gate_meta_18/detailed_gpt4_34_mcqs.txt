To find the voltage required to electrolytically refine impure copper to pure copper, we need to apply the Nernst equation, which relates the potential difference of an electrochemical cell to the concentrations of the species involved. In this case, we have an impure copper sample with activity 𝑎_(𝐶𝑢) = 0.9, which needs to be converted to pure copper (𝑎_(𝐶𝑢) = 1).

The Nernst equation is given by:

  E = E° - (RT/nF) ln(Q)

where E is the potential, E° is the standard potential, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, n is the number of electrons exchanged, F is Faraday's constant, and Q is the reaction quotient.

In this case, we are interested in the reduction half-reaction:

  Cu^2+ + 2e⁻ -> Cu(s)

The standard potential of this reaction (E°) is given by the following equation:

  E°(Cu^2+/Cu) = 0.34 V

Since the goal is to determine the voltage required to refine the impure copper, we can write the Nernst equation for this system as follows:

  E = 0.34 V - (RT/nF) ln(0.9)

Now, let's plug the given values and solve for E:

R = 8.314 J mol⁻¹ K⁻¹
T = 300 K
n = 2 (for copper)
F = 96500 C mol⁻¹

E = 0.34 V - [(8.314 J mol⁻¹ K⁻¹ × 300 K) / (2 × 96500 C mol⁻¹)] ln(0.9)
E = 0.34 V - [(2494.2 J mol⁻¹) / (193000 C mol⁻¹)] ln(0.9)

To convert the units to volts, we need to remember that 1 J = 1 C·V:

E = 0.34 V - [(2494.2 / 193000] ln(0.9)
E ≈ 0.34 V - 0.00272 V

E ≈ 0.33728 V

Now, let's convert this value to millivolts (mV) by multiplying by 1000:

E ≈ 0.33728 V × 1000 = 337.28 mV

Since 337.28 mV ≈ 364 mV, none of the given options are close to the correct answer. However, let's consider the closest option, (D) 5.44 mV.

If the correct answer were indeed (D) 5.44 mV, then the Nernst equation would look like this:

E = 0.34 V - [(RT/nF) ln(0.9)] = 0.00544 V

However, given the values of R, T, n, and F, as well as the activity of 0.9, the calculated potential E is approximately 0.33728 V, which clearly does not match the value of 0.00544 V.

Therefore, it seems like there might be an error in the given options, but based on our calculations, the correct answer is approximately 337.28 mV.
