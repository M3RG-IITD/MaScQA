We can use the following formula to calculate the terminal velocity:
𝐹_𝑑 = 6𝜋𝜇𝑟𝑣
where r is the radius of the inclusion.

First, we need to calculate the radius of the inclusion as follows:
Diameter = 50 micrometers
Radius = D/2 = 25 micrometers = 25 × 10^(-6) m

Next, we can calculate the volume of the inclusion:
Volume = (4/3)πr^3 = (4/3)π(25 × 10^(-6))^3 = 6.54 × 10^(-14) m^3

Using the density of the inclusion, we can calculate its mass:
Mass = Density × Volume = 2500 × 6.54 × 10^(-14) = 1.64 × 10^(-10) kg

Now we can use the formula for terminal velocity:
𝐹_𝑑 = 6𝜋𝜇𝑟𝑣
Solving for v, we get:
v = 𝐹_𝑑/(6𝜋𝜇𝑟)

Plugging in the given values, we get:
v = (3𝜋𝜇𝐷𝑣)/(6𝜋𝜇𝑟)
v = (0.5𝐷𝑣)/r
v = (0.5 × 50 × 10^(-6) × 9.8)/(25 × 10^(-6))
v ≈ 9.8 mm/s

Therefore, the terminal velocity of the inclusion is approximately 9.8 mm/s.

Answer: [9.8]
