We have the data:
Gas constant R = 8.314 J K^(-1)mol^(-1)
Standard enthalpy change ΔH° = -61080 J
Standard entropy change ΔS° = -132.22 J K^(-1)
Temperature range: 298 K to 500 K
Partial pressure of oxygen p(O₂) = 0.3 atm

We can use the Van't Hoff equation to determine the equilibrium constant K at the temperature T:

K = e^(-ΔH°/(RT) + ΔS°/R)

Since we want to find the temperature above which Ag₂O decomposes, we need to find the temperature when the reaction is at equilibrium. At equilibrium:

K = p(O₂)^(1/2)

Plugging the values and solving for T:

0.3^(1/2) = e^(-(-61080)/(8.314*T) - 132.22/8.314)
sqrt(0.3) = e^(61080/(8.314*T) + 132.22/8.314)

Now, take the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(sqrt(0.3)) = 61080/(8.314*T) + 132.22/8.314

To isolate T, reorganize the equation:

8.314*T = 61080/(ln(sqrt(0.3)) - 132.22/8.314)
T = (61080/ln(sqrt(0.3)) - 132.22) / 8.314

Evaluating gives:

T ≈ 328.8 K

Therefore, the temperature above which Ag₂O decomposes in an atmosphere containing oxygen at a partial pressure p(O₂) = 0.3 atm is approximately 328.8 K.

Answer: [328.8].
