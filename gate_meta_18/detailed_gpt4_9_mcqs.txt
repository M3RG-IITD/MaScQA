Let's analyze each material one by one.

P. Aluminium alloys

Aluminium alloys, when exposed to air, form a thin passivating oxide layer on their surface. This layer is highly adhesive and provides effective protection against corrosion.

Q. Mild steel

Mild steel does not form a passivating layer on its surface. Instead, it corrodes when exposed to oxygen and moisture. Corrosion protection for mild steel typically relies on coatings, such as paints, rather than passivation.

R. Stainless steel

Stainless steel, which contains chromium, is designed to develop a thin, stable, and adherent passive film on its surface when exposed to air. This passivating chromium oxide layer resists further oxidation and thus protects the steel from corrosion.

S. Silver

Silver does not typically form a stable passivating oxide layer. It can tarnish or corrode when exposed to certain substances, such as sulfur compounds present in the air. To protect silver, people often use lacquers, coatings or store it in airtight containers.

Based on the above analysis, the materials that are protected by passivation from corrosion are Aluminium alloys (P) and Stainless steel (R).

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) P & R.
