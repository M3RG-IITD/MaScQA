The overall reaction for the electrolytic refining of copper is: 

Cu$^{2+}$ (aq) + 2e$^-$ $\rightarrow$ Cu(s)

We want to calculate the voltage required to drive this reaction at 300 K. We can use the Nernst equation, which relates the voltage to the standard voltage and the activities of the species involved:

$E = E^{\circ} - \frac{RT}{nF}\ln(Q)$

where $E^{\circ}$ is the standard voltage, $R$ is the gas constant, $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin, $n$ is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction, $F$ is Faraday’s constant, and $Q$ is the reaction quotient, which is the ratio of the product of the activities of the copper ions and electrons to the product of the activities of the solid copper and water (which is treated as constant).

First, we need to find the standard voltage $E^{\circ}$ using a table of standard reduction potentials. The reduction half-reaction for copper is:

Cu$^{2+}$ (aq) + 2e$^-$ $\rightarrow$ Cu(s)

The standard reduction potential for this half-reaction is +0.34 V. Since we want the oxidation half-reaction, the standard voltage for the overall reaction is:

$E^{\circ} = - (+0.34 V) = -0.34 V$

Next, we need to calculate the reaction quotient $Q$. The activity of the solid copper is considered to be 1, so we only need to calculate the activity of the copper ions. The activity coefficient of copper ions in a solution can be estimated using Raoult’s law, which states that the partial pressure of a gas above a solution is proportional to the mole fraction of the dissolved gas. For a dilute solution, we can assume that the activity of a solute is proportional to its concentration (since Raoult’s law assumes that the solvent behaves ideally, which is a good assumption for dilute solutions).

The activity of the copper ions can be expressed as:

$a_{Cu^{2+}} = \gamma_{Cu^{2+}} \cdot [Cu^{2+}]$

where $[Cu^{2+}]$ is the concentration of copper ions and $\gamma_{Cu^{2+}}$ is the activity coefficient.

The activity coefficient can be estimated using the following equation (since we are at a very low concentration of copper ions):

$\log \gamma_{Cu^{2+}} = -0.51 \cdot (\sqrt{I})$

where $I$ is the ionic strength of the solution, which is a measure of the total concentration of ions (both copper ions and any other ions present in the solution). For this calculation, we can assume that the ionic strength is very low (since the copper concentration is low), so we can simplify the equation to:

$\gamma_{Cu^{2+}} \approx 1$

Substituting this expression for the activity coefficient and the given value for the activity of the copper ions into the equation for $Q$, we have:

$Q = \frac{a_{Cu^{2+}}^2}{a_{Cu(s)}} = \frac{(0.9)^2}{1} = 0.81$

We can now substitute all the values into the Nernst equation to solve for $E$:

$E = -0.34 - \frac{RT}{2F}\ln(0.81)$

$E = -0.34 - \frac{(8.314 \ J \ mol^{-1} K^{-1})(300 \ K)}{(2)(96500 \ C \ mol^{-1})}\ln(0.81)$

$E \approx -0.341 $

(Note that the units cancel out as required, leaving only volts.)

The calculated voltage is negative, which means that the reaction is non-spontaneous and will require an external voltage to drive it. The magnitude of the voltage is 0.341 V, which is equivalent to 341 mV or 0.341 mV. However, since we are asked to give the answer in millivolts and the options are all in millivolts, we choose the option that is closest to 0.341 mV, which is (A) 1.36 mV.

Therefore, the answer is (A) 1.36 mV.
