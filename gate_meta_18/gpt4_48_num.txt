To calculate the total entropy of mixing for the ideal solution, we can use the following equation:

ΔSmix = - R * (n_Au * ln(x_Au) + n_Ag * ln(x_Ag))

where ΔSmix is the entropy of mixing, R is the gas constant, and n_Au and n_Ag are the moles of Au and Ag, respectively. x_Au and x_Ag are the mole fractions of Au and Ag.

First, we need to calculate the mole fractions (x_Au and x_Ag):

x_Au = n_Au / (n_Au + n_Ag)
x_Ag = n_Ag / (n_Au + n_Ag)

x_Au = 2 / (2 + 3) = 2/5
x_Ag = 3 / (2 + 3) = 3/5

Now we can calculate the entropy of mixing:

ΔSmix = - R * (n_Au * ln(x_Au) + n_Ag * ln(x_Ag))
ΔSmix = - 8.314 * (2 * ln(2/5) + 3 * ln(3/5))

Calculating the value:

ΔSmix = - 8.314 * (-2.536) = 21.09 J K-1

Rounded off to one decimal place, the total entropy of mixing is 21.1 J K-1.
