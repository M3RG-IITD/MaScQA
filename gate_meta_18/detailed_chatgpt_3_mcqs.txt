According to the Buckingham pi theorem, the number of independent dimensionless variables is given by:

Number of variables - Number of fundamental dimensions

In this case, we have 5 variables and 3 fundamental dimensions (M, L, T). Therefore, the number of independent dimensionless variables is:

5 - 3 = 2

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) 2
