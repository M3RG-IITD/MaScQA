To find the associated volume change, we first need to find the volume of both the BCC and FCC structures.

The volume of a BCC unit cell can be calculated using the formula: V_BCC = a_BCC^3, where a_BCC is the lattice parameter of the BCC phase.
The volume of an FCC unit cell can be calculated using the formula: V_FCC = a_FCC^3, where a_FCC is the lattice parameter of the FCC phase.

Plug in the given lattice parameters:

V_BCC = (0.293 nm)^3 = 0.025104537 nm^3
V_FCC = (0.363 nm)^3 = 0.047816397 nm^3

Now, we can find the volume change (∆V) as a percentage using the formula: ∆V(%) = [(V_FCC - V_BCC) / V_BCC] × 100

∆V(%) = [(0.047816397 - 0.025104537) / 0.025104537] × 100
∆V(%) = [0.02271186 / 0.025104537] × 100
∆V(%) = 0.90475 × 100

Round off the value to one decimal place:
∆V(%) = 90.5 %

So, the associated volume change is [90.5%].
