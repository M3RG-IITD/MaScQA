The Jominy end-quench test is a method of evaluating the hardenability of a steel, examining how the steel reacts to different cooling rates after being quenched from the austenitizing temperature. The test involves heating a cylindrical sample and then quenching one end of it in water, creating a smooth gradient of cooling rates along the length of the sample. Microstructures formed at different distances from the quenched end are then analyzed.

Let's analyze the given sequences of microstructures and determine the correct one for the eutectoid plain-carbon steel.

(A) Fine Pearlite, Coarse Pearlite, Martensite and Pearlite, Martensite
(B) Martensite, Martensite and Pearlite, Fine Pearlite, Coarse Pearlite
(C) Coarse Pearlite, Pearlite and Martensite, Fine Pearlite, Martensite
(D) Martensite, Martensite and Pearlite, Coarse Pearlite, Fine Pearlite

Remember that martensite is the hardest and most brittle structure formed by rapid cooling, while pearlite is a lamellar structure formed by slow cooling containing ferrite and cementite. Fine pearlite has a smaller interlamellar spacing than coarse pearlite, making it harder but less ductile.

At the quenched end of the specimen, the cooling rate is very fast, and this is where martensite is most likely to form due to the rapid cooling. So, we can eliminate options (A) and (C).

Now we have the following two options:
(B) Martensite, Martensite and Pearlite, Fine Pearlite, Coarse Pearlite
(D) Martensite, Martensite and Pearlite, Coarse Pearlite, Fine Pearlite

As we move away from the quenched end, the cooling rate becomes slower. Thus, we begin to see a mixture of martensite and pearlite due to the intermediate cooling rates. After that, as the cooling rate becomes even slower, we first encounter finer pearlite and then, at the slowest cooling rate, coarse pearlite. 

So, the correct sequence should be:

(B) Martensite, Martensite and Pearlite, Fine Pearlite, Coarse Pearlite

Answer: [B]
