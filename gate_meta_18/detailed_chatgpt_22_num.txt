As per the given phase diagram, the alloy with 16% B falls in the A-rich end of the A-B binary eutectic.

First, we need to determine the approximate temperature of the eutectic point, which is the intersection point of the two lines in the diagram. The eutectic point temperature is approximately -6°C.

Next, we can determine the solidus and liquidus temperatures for the 16% B alloy by drawing a horizontal line intersecting the A-rich liquidus line at 16% B and a vertical line intersecting the eutectic point.

The solidus temperature is the temperature at which the alloy completely solidifies, and is the point where the horizontal line intersects the A-rich solidus line. In this case, the solidus temperature is approximately -18.5°C.

The liquidus temperature is the temperature at which the alloy completely melts, and is the point where the horizontal line intersects the A-rich liquidus line. In this case, the liquidus temperature is approximately -1.5°C.

Therefore, the freezing range of the alloy with 16% B is:

-18.5°C to -1.5°C

Answer: [-18.5, -1.5]
