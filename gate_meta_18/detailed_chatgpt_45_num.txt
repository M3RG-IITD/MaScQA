The equation for the terminal velocity of a small sphere in a fluid is given by: 

$v = {\frac{2r^2(\rho_p-\rho_f)g}{9\mu}}$

where,

$v$ is the terminal velocity of the sphere (in m/s)

$r$ is the radius of the sphere (in m)

$\rho_p$ is the density of the sphere (in kg/m^3)

$\rho_f$ is the density of the fluid (in kg/m^3)

$g$ is the acceleration due to gravity (in m/s^2)

$\mu$ is the viscosity of the fluid (in Pa.s)

First, we need to convert the diameter of the inclusion from micrometers to meters:

$D = 50\mu m = 0.00005m$

The radius of the inclusion is:

$r = \frac{D}{2} = 0.000025m$

The density difference between the inclusion and the liquid steel is:

$\rho_p - \rho_f = 2500 - 7900 = -5400 kg/m^3$

Substituting the given values into the equation for terminal velocity, we get:

$v = {\frac{2(0.000025)^2(-5400)(9.8)}{9(0.0079)}}$

Simplifying this expression, we get:

$v = -0.00012045$

The negative sign indicates that the inclusion will settle rather than rise in the liquid steel.

To convert this velocity to mm/s, we multiply by 1000:

$v_{mm/s} = -0.12045$

Rounding this to two decimal places, we get:

$v_{mm/s} = -0.12$

Therefore, the terminal velocity (in mm/s) of the inclusion is -0.12. 

Note: The negative sign indicates that the inclusion will settle rather than rise in the liquid steel.
