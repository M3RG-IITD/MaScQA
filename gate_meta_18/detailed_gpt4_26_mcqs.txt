To find the excess molar free energy, $G^{XS,L}$, we first need to determine the molar free energy of the liquid solution at the given values of x and T, and then subtract the molar free energy of the "ideal" solution from it.

Step 1: Calculate the molar free energy of the liquid solution at x = 0.5 and T = 1000 K.

We are given the following equation for the molar free energy of the liquid solution:

$G^{L}(T,x)$ = (1-x)*$[G_(A)]^{0,L}$ + x*$[G_(B)]^{0,L}$ + RT[xlnx + (1-x)ln(1-x)] + 4000x(1-x)

Substitute the given values of x and T:

$G^{L}(T = 1000K, x = 0.5)$ = (1-0.5)*$[G_(A)]^{0,L}$ + 0.5*$[G_(B)]^{0,L}$ + (8.314)(1000)[0.5ln0.5 + (1-0.5)ln(1-0.5)] + 4000(0.5)(1-0.5)

$G^{L}(1000, 0.5)$ = 0.5*$[G_(A)]^{0,L}$ + 0.5*$[G_(B)]^{0,L}$ - (8.314)(1000)(0.5) + 1000

Keep this equation as-is for now since we do not have the values of $[G_(A)]^{0,L}$ and $[G_(B)]^{0,L}$.

Step 2: Calculate the molar free energy of an ideal solution at x = 0.5 and T = 1000 K.

The equation for the molar free energy of an ideal solution is given by:

$G^{ideal}(T,x)$ = (1-x)*$[G_(A)]^{0,L}$ + x*$[G_(B)]^{0,L}$ + RT[xlnx + (1-x)ln(1-x)]

Substitute the given values of x and T:

$G^{ideal}(T = 1000K, x = 0.5)$ = (1-0.5)*$[G_(A)]^{0,L}$ + 0.5*$[G_(B)]^{0,L}$ - (8.314)(1000)(0.5)

Keep this equation as-is for now since we do not have the values of $[G_(A)]^{0,L}$ and $[G_(B)]^{0,L}$.

Step 3: Calculate the excess molar free energy, $G^{XS,L}$, by subtracting the molar free energy of the ideal solution from the molar free energy of the liquid solution.

$G^{XS,L}$ = $G^{L}(1000, 0.5)$ - $G^{ideal}(1000, 0.5)$

Using the equations from Steps 1 and 2:

$G^{XS,L}$ = [0.5*$[G_(A)]^{0,L}$ + 0.5*$[G_(B)]^{0,L}$ - (8.314)(1000)(0.5) + 1000] - [0.5*$[G_(A)]^{0,L}$ + 0.5*$[G_(B)]^{0,L}$ - (8.314)(1000)(0.5)]

Notice that the terms with $[G_(A)]^{0,L}$ and $[G_(B)]^{0,L}$ will cancel each other out:

$G^{XS,L}$ = 1000

So, the excess molar free energy for an alloy with x = 0.5 at T = 1000 K is 1000 J $mol^{-1}$. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) 1000 J $mol^{-1}$
