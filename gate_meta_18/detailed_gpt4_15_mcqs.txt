To determine which welding process is not suitable for joining thin metal sheets, let's evaluate each process briefly:

(A) Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) - also known as Metal Inert Gas (MIG) welding, is versatile and can be used with a variety of material thicknesses, including thin metal sheets. The process involves feeding a continuous solid wire electrode through a welding gun and into the weld pool, protected by an inert shielding gas such as argon or helium. This process is suitable for joining thin metal sheets.

(B) Electro Slag Welding (ESW) - is used primarily for welding thick materials or heavy plates. The process involves a consumable guide tube, which transmits electric current to a pool of molten slag. The slag heats the workpieces to welding temperature, and the consumable material is deposited in the joint. Due to the high temperatures and large amounts of heat generated, ESW is not suitable for thin metal sheets as it can cause burn-through and distortion.

(C) Electron Beam Welding (EBW) - is a precise welding process where a high-velocity electron beam generates heat upon impact with the workpiece, resulting in the formation of the weld. Electron beam welding is capable of joining a wide range of materials and thicknesses, including thin metal sheets. The process requires a vacuum chamber and is therefore costly but provides high-quality welds and is suitable for thin sheet welding.

(D) Laser Beam Welding (LBW) - utilizes a focused, high-energy laser beam to penetrate the workpiece and create a molten weld pool. The process is known for its precision, low heat input, and high welding speeds. Due to these attributes, laser beam welding is suitable for joining thin metal sheets with minimal distortion.

Based on the information provided, the welding process that is NOT suitable for joining thin metal sheets is:
