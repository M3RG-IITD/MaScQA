To find the excess molar free energy, we first need to find the molar free energy of the alloy, $G^(L)(T,x)$, and then subtract the molar free energy of the ideal mixture, $G^{0,L}$.

We are given the molar free energy of the alloy, $G^(L)(T,x)$, in the problem statement:

$G^(L)(T,x)$ = (1-x)*$[G_(A)]^(0,L)$ + x*$[G_(B)]^(0,L)$ + RT[xlnx + (1-x)ln(1-x)] + 4000x(1-x)

Since x = 0.5 and T = 1000 K, we can plug these values into the equation:

$G^(L)(1000,0.5)$ = (1-0.5)*$[G_(A)]^(0,L)$ + 0.5*$[G_(B)]^(0,L)$ + 8.314*1000[0.5ln0.5 + (1-0.5)ln(1-0.5)] + 4000(0.5)(1-0.5)

Now, we need to find the molar free energy of the ideal mixture, $G^{0,L}$.

$G^{0,L}(T,x)$ = (1-x)*$[G_(A)]^(0,L)$ + x*$[G_(B)]^(0,L)$ + RT[xlnx + (1-x)ln(1-x)]

Plugging in x = 0.5 and T = 1000 K:

$G^{0,L}(1000,0.5)$ = (1-0.5)*$[G_(A)]^(0,L)$ + 0.5*$[G_(B)]^(0,L)$ + 8.314*1000[0.5ln0.5 + (1-0.5)ln(1-0.5)]

Now we need to find the excess molar free energy, $ùê∫^(XS,L)$, by subtracting the molar free energy of the ideal mixture from the molar free energy of the alloy:

$ùê∫^(XS,L)$ = $G^(L)(1000,0.5)$ - $G^{0,L}(1000,0.5)$

Notice that the terms (1-x)*$[G_(A)]^(0,L)$ + x*$[G_(B)]^(0,L)$ cancel out in the subtraction. So we are left with:

$ùê∫^(XS,L)$ = 4000(0.5)(1-0.5)

$ùê∫^(XS,L)$ = 4000(0.5)(0.5)

$ùê∫^(XS,L)$ = 1000 J $mol^(-1)$

So the correct answer is (A) 1000 J $mol^(-1)$.
