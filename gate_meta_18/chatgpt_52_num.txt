We can use Bragg's law to solve this problem:

nλ = 2dsinθ

where n is the order of the peak (in this case, n = 1), λ is the wavelength of the X-rays, d is the interplanar spacing of the crystal lattice (in this case, for BCC iron, d = a/√3, where a is the lattice parameter), and θ is the Bragg angle (in degrees).

Plugging in the values we know:

n = 1
d = 0.287 nm / √3 ≈ 0.166 nm
θ = 68.7°

We can convert θ to radians:

θ (in radians) = 68.7° * π/180 ≈ 1.199 radians

Now we can rearrange Bragg's law to solve for λ:

λ = 2dsinθ / n

Plugging in the values we know:

λ = 2 * 0.166 nm * sin(1.199) / 1 ≈ 0.091 nm

Rounding off to three decimal places, the wavelength of X-rays is 0.091 nm.

Answer: [0.091]
