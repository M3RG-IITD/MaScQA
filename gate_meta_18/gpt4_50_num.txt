First, we write expressions for the pressure of the liquid alloy with $X_{Zn}$ = 1.0 and $X_{Zn}$ = 0.7.

For $X_{Zn}$ = 1.0, we have:

$p_{Zn}(X_{Zn}=1.0) = 3.6 * 10^{-4}$ atm.

For $X_{Zn}$ = 0.7, we will use the Raoult's law expression, which states that $P = X_{Zn} * \gamma_{Zn} * P^*$, where $P^*$ is the vapor pressure of the pure component and $\gamma_{Zn}$ is its activity coefficient.

Given, ln($\gamma_{Zn}$) = 0.875 * $(1 - X_{Zn})^2$. We plug $X_{Zn}$ = 0.7 into the expression:

ln($\gamma_{Zn}$) = 0.875 * $(1 - 0.7)^2$
ln($\gamma_{Zn}$) = 0.875 * (0.3)^2
ln($\gamma_{Zn}$) = 0.875 * 0.09
ln($\gamma_{Zn}$) = 0.07875

Now, find the value of $\gamma_{Zn}$ by taking the exponent:

$\gamma_{Zn}$ = e^(0.07875) = 1.082

Next, we can plug this value of $\gamma_{Zn}$ in Raoult's law expression to find the pressure for the liquid alloy with $X_{Zn}$ = 0.7. 

$p_{Zn}(X_{Zn}=0.7) = 0.7 * 1.082 * 3.6 * 10^{-4}$
$p_{Zn}(X_{Zn}=0.7) = 2.70836 * 10^{-4}$ atm.

Finally, we can find the ratio of the two pressures as follows: 

Ratio = $[p_{Zn}(X_{Zn}=0.7) / p_{Zn}(X_{Zn}=1.0)]$

Ratio = $(2.70836 * 10^{-4}) / (3.6 * 10^{-4})$

Ratio = 0.7523 (rounded up to two decimal places)

So, the ratio of [$p_{Zn}(X_{Zn}=0.7)/p_{Zn}(X_{Zn}=1.0)$] for a liquid alloy with $X_{Zn}$ = 0.7 is approximately [0.75].
