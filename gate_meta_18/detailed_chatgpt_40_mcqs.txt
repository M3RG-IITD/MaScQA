We know that:

Bulk modulus (K) = (−V * ∆P)/(∆V/V)

where, 

V is the original volume,
∆P is the change in pressure,
∆V/V is the volume strain.

As per the given values of stress components, we can calculate the mean stress as:

𝜎_m = (𝜎_x+𝜎_y+𝜎_z)/3

= (300-200+100)/3

= 66.67 MPa

Now, we know that the volumetric strain (ΔV/V) is related to the mean stress (𝜎_m) as:
ΔV/V = -(1/K)*𝜎_m

Substituting the given volumetric strain value in this equation, we get:

3.5 × 10^(-4) = -(1/K) * 66.67 MPa

Therefore, the value of bulk modulus (K) is:

K = - (66.67 MPa) / (3.5 × 10^(-4))

K = - 190.48 GPa

However, we know that bulk modulus cannot be negative. This is because a positive pressure increase should result in a decrease in volume and vice versa, which is not possible when bulk modulus is negative. Therefore, the negative sign in the above equation indicates that the pressure and volume changes are in opposite directions, i.e. the material is undergoing compressibility instead of elasticity.

To obtain the correct answer, we need to take the magnitude of the calculated value of bulk modulus:

K = 190.48 GPa

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 200 GPa (rounded to the nearest integer).
