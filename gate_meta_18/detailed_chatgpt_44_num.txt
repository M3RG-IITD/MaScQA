We have been given the temperature profile of the arc weld across its width as:
T = 2000 * exp(-0.3*$x^2$)

We know that the melting point of the base material is 1500 K.

For the fusion zone, the temperature must be greater than the melting point of the base material, i.e. T > 1500 K.

So, we can set up the inequality:
2000 * exp(-0.3*$x^2$) > 1500

Simplifying this inequality, we get:
exp(-0.3*$x^2$) > 0.75
Taking the natural logarithm on both sides, we get:
-0.3*$x^2$ > ln(0.75)
Multiplying both sides by -1 and dividing by 0.3, we get:
$x^2$ < (1/0.3) * ln(1/0.75)

Simplifying this, we get:
$x^2$ < 3.23
Taking the square root on both sides, we get:
|x| < 1.8

Therefore, the fusion zone extends 1.8 mm on either side of the weld center. The width of the fusion zone is:
2 * 1.8 = 3.6 mm

Hence, the width of the fusion zone is 3.6 mm. 

Answer: [3.6]
