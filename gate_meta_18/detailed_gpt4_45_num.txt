We are given the diameter (D) of the spherical inclusion, the densities of the liquid steel and inclusion, the viscosity of the liquid steel, and the acceleration due to gravity. We are supposed to find the terminal velocity (v) of the spherical inclusion rising in the liquid steel.

First, we need to find the buoyancy force acting on the sphere. To do this, we will use the equation:

$F_{b} = V_{sphere} * (ρ_{steel} - ρ_{inclusion}) * g$

where $V_{sphere}$ is the volume of the sphere, $ρ_{steel}$ is the density of liquid steel, $ρ_{inclusion}$ is the density of the inclusion, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.

The volume of a sphere is given by the equation:

$V_{sphere} = \frac{4}{3} * π * R^3$

where R is the radius of the sphere, which is equal to half of the diameter (D).

Now, let's substitute the given values and find the buoyancy force:

$R = \frac{D}{2} = \frac{50 * 10^{-6}}{2} = 25 * 10^{-6} m$

$V_{sphere} = \frac{4}{3} * π * (25 * 10^{-6})^3 = \frac{4 * π * (25^3) * 10^{-18}}{3} m^3$

Now we can calculate $F_{b}$:

$F_{b} = V_{sphere} * (ρ_{steel} - ρ_{inclusion}) * g = \frac{4 * π * (25^3) * 10^{-18}}{3} * (7900 - 2500) * 9.8 N$

At terminal velocity, the drag force equals the buoyancy force. Therefore,

$F_d = F_b$

We can use Stokes' law to find the drag force:

$F_d = 3 * π * μ * D * v$

where μ is the viscosity of the steel, and v is the terminal velocity. Since $F_d = F_b$, we can set the two equations equal to each other and solve for v:

$3 * π * μ * D * v = \frac{4 * π * (25^3) * 10^{-18}}{3} * (7900 - 2500) * 9.8$

Now, let's solve for v:

$v = \frac{4 * (25^3) * 10^{-18} * (7900 - 2500) * 9.8}{3 * μ * D}$

Since we are given the viscosity of liquid steel (μ), we can plug in the value:

$v = \frac{4 * (25^3) * 10^{-18} * (7900 - 2500) * 9.8}{3 * 0.0079 * 50 * 10^{-6}}$

$v = \frac{4 * (25^3) * 10^{-18} * 5400 * 9.8}{3 * 0.0079 * 50 * 10^{-6}}$

Now, we can find the terminal velocity in meters per second:

$v = 2.9568 * 10^{-3} m/s$

Finally, let's convert the velocity to millimeters per second:

$v = 2.9568 * 10^{-3} * 10^3 = 2.96 mm/s$

Therefore, the terminal velocity of the spherical inclusion of diameter D = 50 micrometers rising in liquid steel is approximately 2.96 mm/s. The correct answer inside a list is:
