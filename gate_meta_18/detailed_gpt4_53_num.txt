To solve this problem, we will use the following concepts:

1. Conservation of energy: In an isolated system, the total energy remains constant.
2. Specific heat capacity: The amount of heat required to change the temperature of 1 mole of a substance by 1 K.
3. Entropy: A measure of the disorder or randomness of a system. When two substances at different temperatures come into thermal contact, heat flows from the hotter substance to the colder one, changing the entropy of both substances.

First, let's find the final equilibrium temperature. Since the system is isolated, the heat gained by the colder copper piece should be equal to the heat lost by the hotter copper piece. Let Tf be the final equilibrium temperature.

Heat gained by colder copper piece = Heat lost by hotter copper piece

m1 * c * (Tf - T1) = m2 * c * (T2 - Tf)

where m1 and m2 are the moles of the two copper pieces (both equal to 1 mol), c is the specific heat capacity of copper (22.6 J $K^(-1)mol^(-1)$), T1 is the initial temperature of the first copper piece (300 K), and T2 is the initial temperature of the second copper piece (400 K).

1 mol * 22.6 J $K^(-1)mol^(-1)$ * (Tf - 300 K) = 1 mol * 22.6 J $K^(-1)mol^(-1)$ * (400 K - Tf)

22.6 Tf - 22.6 * 300 K = 22.6 * 400 K - 22.6 Tf

Now combine and solve for Tf:

45.2 Tf = 13160 K

Tf ≈ 291.15 K

Now, let's find the entropy change for each copper piece (ΔS1 and ΔS2) by using the formula:

ΔS = n * c * ln(Tf / Ti)

ΔS1 = 1 mol * 22.6 J $K^(-1)mol^(-1)$ * ln(291.15 K / 300 K)

ΔS1 ≈ 1 * 22.6 * (-0.030)

ΔS1 ≈ -0.689 J $K^(-1)$

Now calculate ΔS2:

ΔS2 = 1 mol * 22.6 J $K^(-1)mol^(-1)$ * ln(291.15 K / 400 K)

ΔS2 ≈ 1 * 22.6 * (-0.323)

ΔS2 ≈ -7.301 J $K^(-1)$

Now, let's find the total entropy change (ΔS_total):

ΔS_total = ΔS1 + ΔS2

ΔS_total = -0.689 J $K^(-1)$ + (-7.301 J $K^(-1)$)

ΔS_total ≈ -7.990 J $K^(-1)$

So, the entropy change for this process is approximately -7.990 J $K^(-1)$. We can round this to three decimal places:

ΔS_total ≈ -7.990 J $K^(-1)$

Therefore, the correct answer is [-7.990].
