Given that the interdiffusion coefficient for copper in aluminium at 500°C (D1) is 4 * 10^(-14) m^2/s, and the interdiffusion coefficient for copper in aluminium at 600°C (D2) is 8 * 10^(-13) m^2/s.

A copper-aluminium diffusion couple develops a certain concentration profile after an isothermal treatment at 600°C for 10 hours (t2 = 10 hours or 36,000 seconds). We need to find the time t1 required to achieve the same concentration profile at 500°C.

Using Fick's second law, we can write the general equation for the interdiffusion in a binary system:

ΔC = D * (Δt/Δx^2)

where ΔC is the change in concentration, D is the interdiffusion coefficient, Δt is the change in time, and Δx is the distance over which diffusion occurs.

Since we want to find the time for the same concentration profile (ΔC) at different temperatures, we can set up the following equation:

D1 * (t1/Δx^2) = D2 * (t2/Δx^2)

The Δx^2 term will cancel out, and we can solve for t1:

t1 = D1 * (t2/D2)

Now we just need to plug in the given values for D1, D2, and t2:

t1 = (4 * 10^(-14) m^2/s) * ((36,000 s)/(8 * 10^(-13) m^2/s))

t1 = (4/8) * (36,000 * 10^(-1))

t1 = 0.5 * 3600

t1 = 1800 seconds

Now convert the time to hours:

t1 = 1800 s * (1 hour / 3600 s) = 0.5 hours

Therefore, the time required to achieve the same concentration profile at 500°C is 0.5 hours.
