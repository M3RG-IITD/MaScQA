The shift of all the peaks to the left indicates that the solute X has a smaller atomic size than the host metal A. This means that X will preferentially occupy the substitutional lattice sites around the dislocation that are larger than the average lattice spacing of A.

Around an edge dislocation, there are four such sites labeled P, Q, R, and S in the diagram below:

```
(B) --- (C) --- (D) --- (E) --- (F)
 |          P           Q          |
 |                                  |
(A)         DISLOCATION         (G)
 |                                  |
 |          R           S          |
(H) --- (I) --- (J) --- (K) --- (L)
```

Site P is located in the slip plane, and it has the largest spacing, so it will be the most preferred site for solute occupation. Site S is also in the slip plane, but it has the smallest spacing, and therefore, X will not occupy it as often. Sites Q and R are located in the plane perpendicular to the slip plane and have slightly larger spacing than site S but smaller spacing than sites P or S. Thus, X can occupy Q and R sites but its occupancy will be least compared to P.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) P.
