The ideal plastic work can be calculated using the equation:

$W=\int_{V_i}^{V_f}\sigma_{flow}dV$

where $V_i$ and $V_f$ are the initial and final volumes of the billet, respectively, and $\sigma_{flow}$ is the flow stress in compression.

The volume of a cylinder is given by:

$V=\frac{\pi}{4}d^2l$

where $d$ is the diameter of the cylinder and $l$ is the length.

At the initial state, $d=20\text{ mm}$ and $l=100\text{ mm}$, and at the final state, $d=16\text{ mm}$ and $l=100\text{ mm}$. Therefore:

$V_i=\frac{\pi}{4}(20\text{ mm})^2(100\text{ mm})=31416\text{ mm}^3$

$V_f=\frac{\pi}{4}(16\text{ mm})^2(100\text{ mm})=20106\text{ mm}^3$

Substituting these values into the equation for $W$:

$W=\int_{V_i}^{V_f}\sigma_{flow}dV=\sigma_{flow}\int_{V_i}^{V_f}dV$

Since the flow stress is constant, we can take it outside the integral:

$W=\sigma_{flow}\int_{V_i}^{V_f}dV=\sigma_{flow}(V_f-V_i)$

Substituting the values for $\sigma_{flow}$, $V_i$, and $V_f$:

$W=40\text{ MPa}\times(20106\text{ mm}^3-31416\text{ mm}^3)=\boxed{-4.2\text{ J}}$

Note that the negative sign indicates that the work done by the system is negative, meaning that work is done on the system. This is consistent with the fact that the billet is compressed during the extrusion process.
