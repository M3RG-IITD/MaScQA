Explanation:

The welding process that is NOT suitable for joining thin metal sheets is Electro Slag Welding.

(A) Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) is also known as MIG (Metal Inert Gas) welding. It uses a wire electrode and shielding gas to create a weld. This is a common welding process for thin metal sheets.

(B) Electro Slag Welding (ESW) is a welding process that uses a consumable guide tube and a metal plate to create an arc. This process is not suitable for thin metal sheets because the heat input is too high.

(C) Electron Beam Welding (EBW) uses an electron beam to create a weld. This process is commonly used for precision welding of thin metal sheets.

(D) Laser Beam Welding (LBW) uses a laser beam to create a weld. This process is also commonly used for precision welding of thin metal sheets.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Electro Slag Welding.

Answer: 
(B) Electro Slag Welding
