To determine the maximum number of phases in a three-component system at constant pressure, we can use the Gibbs Phase Rule.

The Gibbs Phase Rule states that:

P + F = C + 2

where P is the number of phases, F is the degrees of freedom, and C is the number of components.

In this problem, we are given a three-component system (C = 3) and at constant pressure. Let's first find the degrees of freedom, F.

Since we are at constant pressure, we have one less variable to consider, so we can amend the rule to:

P + F = C + 1

Now, substitute the value of C into the equation:

P + F = 3 + 1

P + F = 4

To find the maximum number of phases, we need to minimize the degrees of freedom. The minimum value of F is 0 because we cannot have negative degrees of freedom. So, when F = 0, we have:

P + 0 = 4
P = 4

The maximum number of phases in a three-component system at constant pressure is 4.

The correct answer is (D) 4.
