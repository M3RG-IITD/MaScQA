To determine the easiest slip system in Zn (hcp) with a c/a ratio of 1.856, we need to compare the resolved shear stress on different slip planes and slip directions. For hcp metals, the slip system with the highest resolved shear stress leads to the easiest deformation.

First, let's describe the hcp crystal structure and the Miller-Bravais indices.

The hcp structure consists of two planes of atoms, with the top plane atoms sitting in the spaces between the atoms in the bottom plane. The top plane is shifted by placing a third plane on top, so that the atoms in the third plane align with the first plane. The unit cell has a hexagonal base (with a 120Â° angle between axes vectors {a1, a2}), with height (c-axis) and an additional lattice vector a3. 
The Miller-Bravais indices (hkil) are used for directions and planes in hexagonal systems (such as hcp). HCP has a four-index system - standard Miller indices (hkl) are used for the base hexagonal plane and a fourth index i is added for directions and planes along the c-axis.

Let's now examine the given slip systems and determine which gives the highest resolved shear stress:

(A) {1 -1 0 0} <1 1 -2 0>
Slip plane: {1 -1 0 0}
Slip direction: <1 1 -2 0>

(B) {1 -1 0 0} <0 0 0 2>
Slip plane: {1 -1 0 0}
Slip direction: <0 0 0 2>

(C) {0 0 0 1} <1 1 -2 0>
Slip plane: {0 0 0 1}
Slip direction: <1 1 -2 0>

(D) {1 0 -1 -1} <1 1 -2 3>
Slip plane: {1 0 -1 -1}
Slip direction: <1 1 -2 3>

Note that the ideal hcp c/a ratio is 1.633. The Zn has an experimental c/a ratio of 1.856, which is greater than the ideal value. This means the slip plane orientations in Zn are changed due to the higher c/a ratio. This will affect the resolved shear stress values.

Now, let's analyze the slip systems. In hcp metals, slip usually occurs in the basal plane ({0 0 0 1}) or prismatic plane ( {1-1 0 0} and {1 0 -1 0} ) due to the close-packed nature of these planes. In the given options, slip system (C) has the basal slip plane and slip system (A) and (B) have prismatic slip planes.

Slip system (D) has a non-basal and non-prismatic slip plane ({1 0 -1 -1}), which is less dense and will not lead to easy slip.

As for the slip directions, for hcp metals, the most common slip directions are <1 -1 0 0> and <1 1 -2 0>. Among the given options, slip systems (A) and (C) have the same slip direction (<1 1 -2 0>), which is one of the most common slip directions in hcp metals.

Now let's compare the slip systems (A), (B), and (C).

System (A) has prismatic slip plane {1 -1 0 0} with close-packed direction
System (B) has prismatic slip plane {1 -1 0 0} with an orthogonal direction to the close-packed direction (0 0 0 2)
System (C) has basal slip plane {0 0 0 1} with close-packed direction

Between these three systems, the slip system with the highest resolved shear stress will be the one with the combination of the close-packed plane and close-packed direction. In this case, that would be slip system (C), where the basal plane {0 0 0 1} has the close-packed direction <1 1 -2 0>.

Answer: [C]
