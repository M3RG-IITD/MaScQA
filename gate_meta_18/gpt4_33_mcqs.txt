Let's start by writing the balanced reactions for the production of Fe.

$Fe_2O_3$ + 3C → 2Fe + 3CO

This reaction uses 3 moles of C to produce 2 moles of Fe. So for 1 mole of Fe produced, we use 1.5 moles of C. However, we are given that 2.38 moles of C are used for every mole of Fe produced. Thus, C not only reacts with $Fe_2O_3$ but also with $O_2$

The excess carbon (0.88 moles) reacts with $O_2$ to form a mixture of CO and $CO_2$, with a 1:1 molar ratio.

The reactions with oxygen for producing CO and $CO_2$ can be written as:

1) C + $O_2$ → CO
2) C + $O_2$ → $CO_2$

Since the molar ratio of CO to $CO_2$ is 1:1, we have:
0.44 moles of C react with $O_2$ to form CO, and 0.44 moles of C react with $O_2$ to form $CO_2$.

Combining both the reactions gives:

0.44 C + 0.44 $O_2$ → 0.44 CO
0.44 C + 0.44 $O_2$ → 0.44 $CO_2$

Let's calculate the total number of moles of $O_2$ consumed:

0.44 moles of $O_2$ for CO and 0.44 moles of $O_2$ for $CO_2$. 

Total moles of $O_2$ consumed = 0.44 + 0.44 = 0.88 moles

Therefore, for every mole of Fe produced, 0.88 moles of $O_2$ is consumed.

The correct answer is (C) 0.513.
