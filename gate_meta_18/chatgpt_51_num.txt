Firstly, we need to calculate the standard Gibbs energy change (∆𝐺°) of the reaction using the formula: 

∆𝐺° = ∆𝐻° - T∆𝑆° 

where T is the temperature in Kelvin. 

Substituting the given values: 

∆𝐺° = (-61080 J) - T(−132.22 J $K^(−1)$) 

At equilibrium, the Gibbs energy change (∆𝐺) is zero. So, at the temperature above which $Ag_(2)O$ decomposes in an atmosphere containing oxygen at a partial pressure $𝑝_(𝑂_2)$ = 0.3 atm, we can set:

∆𝐺 = 0 = ∆𝐺° + RT ln $𝑝_{𝑂2}$ 

where R is the gas constant, and ln is the natural logarithm. 

Substituting the given values: 

0 = (-61080 J) - T(−132.22 J $K^(−1)$) + (8.314 J $K^(-1)mol^(-1)$) (ln 0.3) 

Solving for T, we get: 

T = 790.3 K (approx) 

Therefore, the temperature above which $Ag_(2)O$ decomposes in an atmosphere containing oxygen at a partial pressure $𝑝_(𝑂_2)$ = 0.3 atm is 790.3 K. 

Answer: 

- 790.3 K
