The saturation magnetization (I) can be calculated using the formula:
I = (𝑁𝜇^2𝑆)/ (3𝑘𝐵𝑇)
where,
N = Avogadro's number
𝜇 = magnetic moment of an Fe atom in Am2 (given as 2 𝜇𝐵 = 2 x 9.273 × 10^(-24) A m^2)
S = number of Fe atoms per unit cell of BCC structure (S = 2)
k = Boltzmann constant
T = temperature in Kelvin
The lattice parameter of BCC iron is given as 0.287 nm. We can convert it into meters by multiplying with 10^(-9) as 1 nm = 10^(-9) m.

Substituting the given values, we get:
I = [(6.022 × 10^23)/(0.287 × 10^(-9))^3] x (2 x 9.273 × 10^(-24))^2 x 2 / (3 x 1.3807 × 10^(-23) x 300)
I = 1737.06 A/m

Converting A/m into kAm-1 and rounding off to one decimal place, we get:
I = 1.7 kAm-1

Therefore, the saturation magnetization of Fe in kAm-1 rounded off to one decimal place is 1.7.

Answer: [1.7]
