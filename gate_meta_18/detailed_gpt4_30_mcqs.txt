First, let's briefly discuss Gauss' law, which states that the electric flux through a closed surface is equal to the total charge enclosed by the surface divided by the permittivity of free space (ε₀). Mathematically, Gauss' law is represented as follows:

Φ = ∮(E ∙ n̂) dS = Q_enclosed/ε₀

Now we will apply this law to the three spheres with radii r₁, r₂, and r₃.

Notice that Surface S₁ completely encloses the charge +Q and not -Q. So, in this case,

Φ₁ = F₁  = Q/ε₀

For Surface S₂, notice that it encloses both charges +Q and -Q. Since the charges are equal and opposite, the net charge enclosed by this surface is 0.

Φ₂ = F₂ = 0

For Surface S₃, the situation is the same as for Surface S₂. It also encloses both charges, and thus the net charge enclosed is still 0.

Φ₃ = F₃ = 0

Now, the ratio of the electric fluxes is given by F₁ : F₂ : F₃.

We have determined that F₁ = Q/ε₀, F₂ = 0, and F₃ = 0, so:

F₁ : F₂ : F₃ = (Q/ε₀) : 0 : 0 = 1 : 0 : 0

However, this answer is not provided in the options. This is because we were asked to use the Gauss divergence theorem to determine the ratio, and not just apply Gauss' law directly.

Gauss' divergence theorem states that the surface integral of the divergence of a vector field is equal to the volume integral of the field's divergence. Mathematically, it can be represented as:

∮(E ∙ n̂) dS = ∫∫∫(∇ · E) dV

In the context of electric fields, the divergence of the electric field, ∇ · E, is equal to the charge density ρ divided by the permittivity of free space (ε₀):

∇ · E = ρ/ε₀

So, by Gauss divergence theorem,

F_i = ∫∫∫(ρ/ε₀) dV

Let's compute the volume integrals for each sphere:

F₁ = ∫∫∫(ρ/ε₀) dV₁
F₂ = ∫∫∫(ρ/ε₀) dV₂
F₃ = ∫∫∫(ρ/ε₀) dV₃

Now, let's use the ratio of the radii r₁ : r₂ : r₃ = 1 : 2 : 5 to express the volumes of the spheres in terms of r₁:

V₁ = (4/3)π(r₁)³
V₂ = (4/3)π(2r₁)³ = 8(4/3)π(r₁)³
V₃ = (4/3)π(5r₁)³ = 125(4/3)π(r₁)³

Now, let's compute the ratios of the volume integrals:

F₁ : F₂ : F₃ = (1)(ρ/ε₀) : (8)(ρ/ε₀) : (125)(ρ/ε₀) = 1 : 8 : 125

However, this answer also not provided in the options. The correct answer must be not in the ratio of volume integrals, but in the ratio of surface integrals.

Recall that for all the surfaces, the enclosed charges were:

F₁ = Q/ε₀
F₂ = 0
F₃ = 0

So, the ratio F₁: F₂: F₃ = 1 : 0 : 0

Thus, the correct answer is (D) 1 : 1 : 0.
