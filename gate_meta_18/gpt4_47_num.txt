First, we need to find the volume of the unit cell of the BCC iron. 

The BCC unit cell contains two atoms, and its volume can be calculated by:

V = a³

where a is the lattice parameter. 

Given the lattice parameter, a = 0.287 nm or 0.287 × 10^-9 m, we can calculate the volume:

V = (0.287 × 10^-9)³ = 2.373 × 10^-29 m³

Now, we need to find the saturation magnetization (Ms), which is the magnetic moment per unit volume.

Ms = (2 * 𝜇B) / V

where 𝜇B is the magnetic moment of the Fe atom.

Given that the net magnetic moment of an Fe atom in the BCC structure is 2 𝜇B, we can calculate the saturation magnetization:

Ms = (2 * 9.273 × 10^-24 A m²) / (2.373 × 10^-29 m³)

Ms = 7.826 × 10² A/m

To convert to kAm⁻¹, we divide by 1000:

Ms = 7.826 × 10² A/m / 1000 = 7.826 × 10⁻¹ kA/m 

Rounding off to one decimal place, the saturation magnetization of Fe in kAm⁻¹ is:

Ms ≈ 7.8 kAm⁻¹

So, the answer is [7.8].
