We are given the vapour pressure of pure liquid Zn at 710 K as $p_{Zn}(X_{Zn} = 1.0) = 3.6 * 10^{-4}$ atm, and the Raoultian activity coefficient expression for Zn in the Zn-Cd alloy liquid at 710 K as ln($\gamma_{Zn}$) = 0.875 * $(1 - X_{Zn})^2$.

We are asked to find the ratio $[\frac{p_{Zn}(X_{Zn} = 0.7)}{p_{Zn}(X_{Zn} = 1.0)}]$.

The first thing we need to do is calculate the activity coefficient, $\gamma_{Zn}$, for $X_{Zn} = 0.7$. Using the given expression,

ln($\gamma_{Zn}$) = 0.875 * $(1 - X_{Zn})^2$

ln($\gamma_{Zn}$) = 0.875 * $(1 - 0.7)^2$

ln($\gamma_{Zn}$) = 0.875 * 0.09

ln($\gamma_{Zn}$) = 0.07875

To find the value of $\gamma_{Zn}$, we need to exponentiate both sides:

$\gamma_{Zn}$ = $e^{0.07875}$

$\gamma_{Zn}$ ≈ 1.082 (rounded to three decimal places)

Now, we know from Raoult's Law that:

$p_{Zn} = \gamma_{Zn} * X_{Zn} * p_{Zn}(X_{Zn} = 1.0)$

For $X_{Zn} = 0.7$, we can express the partial pressure $p_{Zn}(X_{Zn} = 0.7)$ as:

$p_{Zn}(X_{Zn} = 0.7) = \gamma_{Zn} * 0.7 * p_{Zn}(X_{Zn} = 1.0)$ 

$p_{Zn}(X_{Zn} = 0.7) = 1.082 * 0.7 * 3.6 * 10^{-4}$

$p_{Zn}(X_{Zn} = 0.7) ≈ 2.718 * 10^{-4}$ (rounded to three decimal places)

Now, we can find the ratio as follows:

$\frac{p_{Zn}(X_{Zn} = 0.7)}{p_{Zn}(X_{Zn} = 1.0)} = \frac{2.718 * 10^{-4}}{3.6 * 10^{-4}}$

$\frac{p_{Zn}(X_{Zn} = 0.7)}{p_{Zn}(X_{Zn} = 1.0)} ≈ 0.754$ (rounded to three decimal places)

Therefore, the ratio $[\frac{p_{Zn}(X_{Zn} = 0.7)}{p_{Zn}(X_{Zn} = 1.0)}]$ for a liquid alloy with $X_{Zn} = 0.7$ is approximately 0.75 (rounded to two decimal places).
