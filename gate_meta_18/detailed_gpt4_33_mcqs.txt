Let's first write equations for the reactions. The production of iron from iron oxide is a reduction reaction. Carbon is the reducing agent here. We can assume that carbon reacts with iron oxide and oxygen to produce CO and CO2.

Fe₂O₃ + 3C → 2Fe + 3CO        (1)

For CO₂ production, we have the equation:

CO + 1/2O₂ → CO₂        (2)

For every mole of CO, an equal mole of CO2 is produced. This means half the mole of O₂ is needed to convert CO to CO₂.

Now let's find the total moles of CO and CO₂ in the exit gas.

2.38 moles of carbon are used for every mole of iron produced. So, for every mole of iron produced, we have:

moles of CO = 2.38/2 = 1.19 moles
moles of CO₂ = 1.19 moles

Now let's calculate the total moles of O₂ consumed for the conversion of CO to CO₂.

moles of O₂ = moles of CO₂ * 1/2 = 1.19 * 1/2 = 0.595 moles

Since the exit gas contains CO and CO₂ in a 1:1 ratio, we have 1 mole of CO react with 0.5 moles of O₂ to produce 1 mole of CO₂. 

Now, let's consider the iron production reaction from equation (1).

Using the stoichiometry of the reaction, for every mole of Fe₂O₃ consumed, 1.5 moles of O₂ are consumed.

moles of Fe₂O₃ = moles of Fe / 2 = 1 / 2 = 0.5 moles
moles of O₂ for Fe₂O₃ = moles of Fe₂O₃ * 1.5 = 0.5 * 1.5 = 0.75 moles

Now let's add the moles of O₂ consumed for both reactions.

Total moles of O₂ consumed = moles of O₂ consumed by CO + moles of O₂ consumed by Fe₂O₃
Total moles of O₂ consumed = 0.595 + 0.75 = 1.345 moles

Thus, for every mole of Fe produced, 1.345 moles of O₂ are consumed.

The correct answer is 1.345, which is not in the given options (A, B, C or D). It is important to note that in the given problem, there is not enough information to match any of the possible answers. Therefore, the correct answer should not be limited to the options provided.
