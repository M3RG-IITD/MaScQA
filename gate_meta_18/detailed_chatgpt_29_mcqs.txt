We can use the Griffith's criterion to determine whether the fibre will undergo brittle fracture or not. According to the criterion, a material will undergo brittle fracture if the following condition is satisfied:

2 γ_s / E >= (π * a)^0.5

where γ_s is the surface energy, E is the elastic modulus, and a is the half-length of a surface flaw.

Assuming that the flaws have a range of lengths, we can take the average flaw length as the half-length, i.e., a = 5 micron / 2 = 2.5 micron.

Substituting the given values, we get:

2 * 0.3 J/m^2 / (70 * 10^9 Pa) >= (π * 2.5 * 10^(-6) m)^0.5

Simplifying this expression, we get:

1.29 * 10^(-6) >= 6.28 * 10^(-6)

This condition is not satisfied, which means that the fibre will not undergo brittle fracture.

Now, we need to determine whether the fibre will undergo plastic deformation or elastic deformation. For this, we can use the stress-strain relation:

σ = E * ε

where σ is the applied tensile stress, E is the elastic modulus, and ε is the strain.

The strain ε can be calculated from the diameter change as:

ε = (Δd / d)

where Δd is the diameter change and d is the original diameter.

We can assume that the diameter change at the point of fracture is about 10%. Therefore, Δd = 5 micron * 0.1 = 0.5 micron.

Substituting the given values, we get:

ε = (0.5 micron / 5 micron) = 0.1

Using the stress-strain relation, we get:

ε = σ / E

Solving for σ, we get:

σ = E * ε = (70 * 10^9 Pa) * 0.1 = 7 GPa

Therefore, the fibre will undergo plastic deformation, but not fracture.

Answer: (B) The fibre will undergo plastic deformation, but not fracture
