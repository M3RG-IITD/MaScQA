First, let's consider Henry's law for this problem. Henry's law states that the concentration of a solute in a solution is directly proportional to the partial pressure of the gas above the solution. Mathematically, this can be written as:

C_gas = k_H * p_gas

Where C_gas is the concentration of gas dissolved in a solution, k_H is Henry's law constant for the particular gas and solution, and p_gas is the partial pressure of the gas above the solution.

Since we are given the relation between wt.%C and wt.%O, let's denote C = wt.%C and O = wt.%O. The given relation is:

C * O = K

We know that initially, when p_CO = 1 atm, K = 0.002. Now, let's consider the situation when p_CO = 0.1 atm.

We are assuming Henry's law to be applicable. According to the given question, we know that:

K1 = C1 * O1
K2 = C2 * O2

Where K1 and K2 are the values of K for the system, C1 and O1 are the initial weights for carbon and oxygen, and C2 and O2 are the weights when "$ùëù_(ùê∂ùëÇ)$ = 0.1 atm". Since Henry's law is applicable, the ratio of the concentrations will be equal to the ratio of the partial pressures:

C1 / C2 = p_CO1 / p_CO2
O1 / O2 = p_CO1 / p_CO2
C1 * O1 / C2 * O2 = p_CO1 / p_CO2

Now, we know the values of K1, p_CO1, and p_CO2:

0.002 / K2 = 1 / 0.1

We can now solve for K2:

K2 = 0.002 * 0.1
K2 = 0.0002

So, the value of K when the partial pressure of CO is 0.1 atm is 0.0002.

The correct answer is (D) 0.0002.
