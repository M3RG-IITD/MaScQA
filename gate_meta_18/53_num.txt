Given: Specific heat capacity of copper (between 250 K and 500 K) is 22.6 J $K^(-1)mol^(-1)$ . Assume that the system containing the two pieces of copper remains isolated during this process. A 1 mol piece of copper at 400 K is brought in contact with another 1 mol piece of copper at 300 K, and allowed to reach thermal equilibrium. The entropy(in J $K^(-1)$ to three decimal places) change for this process is?
