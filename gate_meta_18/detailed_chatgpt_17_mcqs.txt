Surface roughness is the measure of the finely spaced surface irregularities of the component after the manufacturing process. Higher surface roughness leads to greater friction, reducing the functionality of the component. The order of the given casting processes based on increasing surface roughness is as follows: 

1. Investment casting - The surface finish of investment casting is excellent due to the smoothness of the mould's internal walls. The surface roughness of investment casting is usually between Ra 0.6-3.2 µm.

2. Permanent mould casting - The surface roughness of permanent mould casting is Ra 1.6-6.3 µm. Therefore, it is second in the list.

3. Pressure die casting - The surface finish obtained in pressure die casting is good, but not as good as investment casting due to the effect of high pressure on the mould walls. The surface roughness of pressure die casting is Ra 0.8-12.5 µm, which places it third in the list.

4. Sand casting - Among the four processes, sand casting results in the highest surface roughness. The surface finish obtained in sand casting is poor, and the surface roughness is usually between Ra 6.3-25.0 µm. Therefore, it is the last in the list.

Therefore, the correct order of the casting processes in increasing magnitude of surface roughness is option (B) P < S < Q < R.
