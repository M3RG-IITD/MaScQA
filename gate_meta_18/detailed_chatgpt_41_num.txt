We are given the volume fraction of fibers in the composite as $V_f=25\%$ and the Young's modulus of the fiber and matrix as $ùê∏_f=250$ GPa and $ùê∏_m=2.5$ GPa, respectively. We need to determine the fraction of load borne by the reinforcement under longitudinal loading assuming iso-strain condition and elastic response. 

Assuming elastic response means that both the fiber and matrix are behaving elastically. Under the iso-strain condition, the deformation of the matrix and the fibers will be the same. Let us assume that the applied stress is $\sigma$ and the fraction of load borne by the fibers is $f$. Then, the stress borne by the fibers, $\sigma_f=f\sigma$ and the stress borne by the matrix, $\sigma_m=(1-f)\sigma$. 

We can express the applied stress in terms of the strain as $\sigma=E\epsilon$, where $E$ is the Young's modulus and $\epsilon$ is the strain. Under the iso-strain condition, the strain of the matrix and fibers will be the same. Therefore, we can write $\epsilon_f=\epsilon_m=\epsilon$. 

The fraction of fiber volume is $V_f=25\%$, which means that the volume of the matrix is $(1-V_f)=75\%$. Therefore, the volume-averaged Young's modulus of the composite can be calculated as follows:

$$E_c=V_fE_f+(1-V_f)E_m$$
$$E_c=0.25(250\text{ GPa})+0.75(2.5\text{ GPa})$$
$$E_c=67.5\text{ GPa}$$

Now, we can equate the stress-strain relationships for the fibers and the matrix to obtain the relationship for the composite. 

For the fibers: 
$$\sigma_f=E_f\epsilon_f$$
$$\sigma_f=250\text{ GPa}\epsilon$$

For the matrix: 
$$\sigma_m=E_m\epsilon_m$$
$$\sigma_m=2.5\text{ GPa}\epsilon$$

For the composite: 
$$\sigma_c=E_c\epsilon$$

Since the strain is the same for both the matrix and the fibers, we can write the following equation for the composite:

$$\sigma_c=\sigma_f+\sigma_m$$
$$E_c\epsilon=(f\sigma) + ((1-f)\sigma)$$
$$E_c\epsilon=\sigma$$

Substituting the expressions for $\sigma_f$ and $\sigma_m$, we get:

$$E_c\epsilon=(250\text{ GPa}\epsilon)f + (2.5\text{ GPa}\epsilon)(1-f)$$
$$E_c\epsilon=247.5\text{ GPa}\epsilon f+2.5\text{ GPa}\epsilon$$

Dividing both sides of the equation by $\epsilon$ and simplifying, we obtain:

$$\sigma_c=E_c[(247.5\text{ GPa})f+(2.5\text{ GPa})]$$

The fraction of load borne by the fibers is given by $f=\frac{\sigma_f}{\sigma}$. We can substitute the expression for $\sigma$ and $\sigma_f$ to obtain:

$$f=\frac{\sigma_f}{\sigma}=\frac{f\sigma}{E_c[(247.5\text{ GPa})f+(2.5\text{ GPa})]}$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$f=\frac{250\text{ GPa}}{E_c(247.5\text{ GPa})+2.5\text{ GPa}}$$

Substituting the value of $E_c$, we get:

$$f=\frac{250\text{ GPa}}{(67.5\text{ GPa})(247.5\text{ GPa})+2.5\text{ GPa}}$$

Simplifying and rounding off the answer to two decimal places, we obtain:

$$f=0.79$$

Therefore, the fraction of load borne by the reinforcement rounded off to two decimal places is 0.79.

- 0.79
