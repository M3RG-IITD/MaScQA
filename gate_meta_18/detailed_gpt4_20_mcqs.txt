Step 1: Understand the problem statement and given conditions.

In this problem, we are asked to find out the name of the process where the steel undergoes plastic deformation below the nose of the TTT curve and above $M_s$. After that, it is quenched to produce fine martensite.

Step 2: Understand the different terms and their significance in the problem.

- TTT curve: It stands for Time-Temperature-Transformation curve. It is a plot of temperature against the logarithm of time for a steel alloy of a specific composition. It is used to determine the rate at which the transformation of austenite to other crystal structures occurs.

- Nose of the TTT curve: It is the point on the TTT curve with the shortest time for the start of transformation.

- $M_s$: It stands for the martensite start temperature. It is the temperature at which the diffusionless transformation of austenite to martensite begins.

- Plastic work: It refers to the plastic deformation that happens while working with the steel.

Step 3: Analyze the given conditions and compare them with the characteristics of the given processes.

(A) Martempering: It is a heat treatment process where the workpiece is austenitized and then quenched in a medium with a temperature just above the martensite start temperature, followed by cooling in air. There is no plastic deformation involved in this process, which eliminates this option.

(B) Ausforming: It is a process where the workpiece is austenitized, then plastically deformed below the nose of the TTT curve but above the $M_s$ temperature, and finally quenched to produce fine martensite. This process seems to fit the given conditions.

(C) Inter-critical forming: It is a process where the workpiece is heated to a temperature between the critical temperatures $A_1$ and $A_3$, then cooled to room temperature. No plastic deformation is involved, which eliminates this option.

(D) Normalizing: It is a heat treatment process where the workpiece is heated to a temperature above the upper critical line, followed by cooling in air. No plastic deformation is involved, which eliminates this option.

Step 4: Compare the processes and choose the correct answer.

From our analysis in step 3, we can conclude that the process involved in the given conditions is: (B) Ausforming.

So, the correct answer is:

[B]
