Given that the exact differential of Gibbs free energy is:

dG = -SdT + VdP + Σ(μ_i dn_i)       (1)

where G is Gibbs free energy, S is entropy, T is the temperature, V is volume, P is pressure, μ_i is chemical potential, and n_i is the number of moles of the i-th component.

Maxwell's relations are derived from cyclic partial derivatives, specifically from the property:

(∂A/∂B)(∂B/∂C)(∂C/∂A) = -1

We also know the following thermodynamic identity:

dG = (∂G/∂T)(dT) + (∂G/∂P)(dP) + Σ[(∂G/∂n_i)(dn_i)]

Comparing this equation with (1), we have:

(∂G/∂T) = -S       (2)

(∂G/∂P) = V       (3)

Now we need to derive a new relationship by going back to (2) and taking the cross partial derivatives:

(∂²G/∂P∂T) = (∂/∂P)(-S)

(∂²G/∂T∂P) = (∂/∂T)(V)

Using the property of mixed partial derivatives, we have:

(∂²G/∂P∂T) = (∂²G/∂T∂P)

So, we have:

(∂/∂P)(-S) = (∂/∂T)(V)

Therefore,

(𝜕𝑆/𝜕P)|$_(T,𝑛_𝑖)$ = -(𝜕V/𝜕T)|$_(P,𝑛_𝑖)$

Thus, the correct answer is (A).
