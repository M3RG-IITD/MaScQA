Powder metallurgy is a process of producing metallic parts from metal powder. In this process, various metal powders are first mixed, compacted, and then sintered to form a solid metal part. 

Out of the four given engineering components, the gas turbine blades (P) and the engine block of an automobile (S) are not produced by powder metallurgy. 

Gas turbine blades (P) are typically produced through casting or forging processes. The engine block of an automobile (S) is usually made by casting or machining.

Tungsten-based heavy alloy penetrators (Q) are commonly produced by powder metallurgy. The process involves mixing tungsten powder with a binder such as cobalt, compacting the mixture into the desired shape, and then sintering the part under high temperature and pressure. 

Self-lubricating bearings (R) are also typically produced by powder metallurgy. The process involves mixing metal powders with a lubricant such as graphite, compacting the mixture, and then sintering the part. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Q & R.
