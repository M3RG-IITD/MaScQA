The total entropy of mixing ($\Delta S_{mix}$) is given by the formula:

$$\Delta S_{mix} = - R \sum_{i} {n_i \ln{x_i}}$$

where $n_i$ is the number of moles of component $i$ and $x_i$ is the mole fraction of component $i$.

To calculate the mole fractions, we need to know the total number of moles of the mixture:

$$Total\ moles = 2\ moles\ of\ Au + 3\ moles\ of\ Ag = 5\ moles$$

Therefore, the mole fraction of Au is:

$$x_{Au} = \frac{2\ moles\ of\ Au}{5\ moles} = 0.4$$

And the mole fraction of Ag is:

$$x_{Ag} = \frac{3\ moles\ of\ Ag}{5\ moles} = 0.6$$

Substituting these values into the formula for $\Delta S_{mix}$ and simplifying, we get:

$$\Delta S_{mix} = - R [ (2\ mol)(0.4)\ln(0.4) + (3\ mol)(0.6)\ln(0.6) ] = -9.09\ J\ K^{-1}$$

Rounding off to one decimal place, the answer is:

-9.1 J K-1

Answer: [-9.1 J K-1]
