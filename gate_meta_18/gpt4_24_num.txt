The maximum possible reduction Δh can be determined by using the formula:

Δh = μ * (h - Δh) * R

where μ is the coefficient of friction, h is the original thickness of the plate, Δh is the reduction in thickness, and R is the roll radius.

First, we need to find the roll radius R. The roll diameter is given as 200 mm, so the radius R is half of the diameter:

R = 200 / 2 = 100 mm

Now we can rearrange the formula for Δh:

Δh = μ * (h - Δh) * R
Δh / μR = h - Δh
Δh / (0.1 * 100) = 120 - Δh
Δh = 10 * (120 - Δh)

This is a linear equation in Δh. Let's solve it:

10*Δh + Δh = 1200
11*Δh = 1200
Δh = 1200 / 11
Δh ≈ 109.1

Therefore, the maximum possible reduction Δh in a single pass is approximately 109.1 mm.

Answer: [109.1]
