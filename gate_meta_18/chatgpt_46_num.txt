To calculate the resolved shear stress on the (111̅) [101] slip system, we need to first determine the slip direction and slip plane normal for this system.

The slip direction [101] is perpendicular to the slip plane (111̅), so we can use the cross product of these two vectors to determine the slip plane normal:

(111̅) x [101] = [-1-1-1] x [1 0 1] = [-1 -2 1]

This means that the slip plane normal for the (111̅) [101] slip system is [-1 -2 1].

Next, we need to determine the resolved shear stress on this slip system. The resolved shear stress is given by:

τ = σ cos(φ) cos(λ)

where σ is the applied tensile stress, φ is the angle between the tensile axis and the slip direction, and λ is the angle between the slip plane normal and the tensile axis.

In this case, the tensile stress is 10 MPa and the slip direction is [101]. The angle between these two vectors can be determined using the dot product:

cos(φ) = [101] · [321] / |[101]| |[321]| = 0.577

The angle between the slip plane normal [-1 -2 1] and the tensile axis [321] can be determined using the dot product as well:

cos(λ) = [-1 -2 1] · [321] / |[-1 -2 1]| |[321]| = -0.408

Note that we use the absolute value of the cosine of λ because we are interested in the magnitude of the resolved shear stress, not its sign.

Plugging these values into the equation for the resolved shear stress, we get:

τ = 10 MPa × 0.577 × (-0.408) = -2.37 MPa

Note that the negative sign indicates that the resolved shear stress is acting in the opposite direction to the applied tensile stress. Also, we rounded off the answer to two decimal places as requested in the question.
