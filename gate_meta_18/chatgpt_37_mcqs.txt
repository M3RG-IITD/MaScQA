The shift of peaks to the left indicates a decrease in the lattice parameter due to the smaller size of X compared to A. When such a dilute substitutional solid solution segregates to an edge dislocation, it prefers to occupy the position where the solute atom experiences the highest tensile strain. This position is where the distance between the solute atom and the dislocation is maximum, which is the R position. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) R. 

The preferred positions around an edge dislocation are labeled as follows:

          P          
          /\

          \/          
          Q           
P: Near-core position
Q: Substitutional position
R: Interstitial position
S: Distant-substitutional position
