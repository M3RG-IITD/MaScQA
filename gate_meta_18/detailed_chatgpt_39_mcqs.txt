The nucleation rate $I$ can be given as:

$$I=A exp\left(-\frac{\Delta G^*}{k_bT}\right)$$

Where $A$ is the pre-exponential factor, $T$ is the temperature, $k_b$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $\Delta G^*$ is the activation free energy. For homogeneous nucleation, this activation free energy can be given as:

$$\Delta G^*=\frac{16\pi\sigma^3}{3\Delta G_v^2}$$

Where $\sigma$ is the interfacial energy between the solid and liquid, and $\Delta G_v$ is the molar volume change during nucleation. 

Now, if the interfacial energy increases by 10%, the new interfacial energy will be $\sigma'=\sigma+\frac{0.1\sigma}{100}=1.1\sigma$. Substituting this in the expression for $\Delta G^*$, we get:

$$\Delta G^{*\prime}=\frac{16\pi(1.1\sigma)^3}{3\Delta G_v^2}=\frac{1.331\Delta G^*}{\Delta G_v^2}$$

Therefore, the new nucleation rate $I'$ will be:

$$I'=A exp\left(-\frac{\Delta G^{*\prime}}{k_bT}\right)=Aexp\left(-\frac{1.331\Delta G^*}{k_bT\Delta G_v^2}\right)$$

Comparing this with the original expression for $I$, we can find the percentage change in $I$ as:

$$\frac{I'-I}{I}=\frac{Aexp\left(-\frac{1.331\Delta G^*}{k_bT\Delta G_v^2}\right)-Aexp\left(-\frac{\Delta G^*}{k_bT\Delta G_v^2}\right)}{Aexp\left(-\frac{\Delta G^*}{k_bT\Delta G_v^2}\right)}$$

Simplifying this expression, we get:

$$\frac{I'-I}{I}=1-exp\left(-\frac{0.331\Delta G^*}{k_bT\Delta G_v^2}\right)\approx \frac{0.331\Delta G^*}{k_bT\Delta G_v^2}$$

Because $exp(-x) \approx 1-x$ for small $x$.

Therefore, the percentage change in $I$ is approximately:

$$\frac{I'-I}{I}\approx \frac{0.331\Delta G^*}{k_bT\Delta G_v^2}$$

We can further simplify this expression by noting that $\Delta G^*=\Delta H^*-\Delta S^*$, where $\Delta H^*$ is the activation enthalpy and $\Delta S^*$ is the activation entropy. Assuming that $\Delta H^*$ and $\Delta G_v$ do not change significantly with the increase in interfacial energy, we can write:

$$\frac{I'-I}{I}\approx \frac{0.331(\Delta H^*-\Delta S^*)}{k_bT\Delta G_v^2}$$

Because $\Delta H^*$ and $\Delta S^*$ have opposite sign, the numerator can be written as $|\Delta H^*|+|\Delta S^*|$. Therefore, the percentage change in $I$ is approximately:

$$\frac{I'-I}{I}\approx \frac{0.331(|\Delta H^*|+|\Delta S^*|)}{k_bT\Delta G_v^2}$$

Now, since we have no information about the sign or magnitude of $\Delta H^*$ and $\Delta S^*$, we cannot determine the sign or magnitude of the percentage change in $I$. Therefore, the correct answer is: 

(E) The sign and magnitude of the percentage change in $I$ cannot be determined from the given information.
