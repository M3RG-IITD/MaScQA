The ideal plastic work is given by:

W = (π/4) * [(D^2 - d^2)/D] * L * σ

Where:
D = initial diameter = 20 mm
d = final diameter = 16 mm
L = length = 100 mm
σ = flow stress = 40 MPa

Substituting the given values, we get:

W = (π/4) * [(20^2 - 16^2)/20] * 100 * 40
W = 2513.3 J (to one decimal place)

Therefore, the ideal plastic work involved in extruding the cylindrical billet is 2513.3 J. 

Answer: [2513.3]
