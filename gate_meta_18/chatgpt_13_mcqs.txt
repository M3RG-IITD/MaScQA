The electrical conductivity is given by $\sigma = q(p\mu_p + n\mu_n)$, where $q$ is the charge of an electron, $p$ is the hole concentration, $n$ is the electron concentration, $\mu_p$ is the hole mobility, and $\mu_n$ is the electron mobility.

Plugging in the given values, we get:

$\sigma = (1.6 \times 10^{-19} C)((1 \times 10^{16} m^{-3})(0.2 m^2.V^{-1}.s^{-1}) + (1 \times 10^{16} m^{-3})(0.1 m^2.V^{-1}.s^{-1}))$

Simplifying, we get:

$\sigma = 3.2 \times 10^{-4} (Ω.m)^{-1}$

Therefore, the answer is (C) 3.2* $10^(-4)(Ω.m)^(-1)$.
