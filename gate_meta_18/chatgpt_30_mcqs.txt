Since the electric field due to a point charge Q at a distance r is given by $E = \frac{1}{4πε_0} \frac{Q}{r^2}$, the magnitude of electric field due to each charge Q at Si is the same and given by $E_{i}=\frac{Q}{4\pi \epsilon_{0} r_{i}^{2}}.$ Since both electric fields are in opposite directions, their contributions add up to zero on the entire sphere.

Using Gauss's divergence theorem,

$∮_{S} E ∙ 𝑛̂ dS = ∫∫∫ (\nabla ∙ E) dV,$

where the integral on the right-hand side is over the entire volume enclosed by the surface S. Since there are no charges within the sphere, the divergence of the electric field is zero and,

$∮_{S_{i}} E ∙ 𝑛̂ dS = 0$

for all the surfaces $S_1, S_2$, and $S_3$.

Therefore,

$F_1:F_2:F_3 = 0:0:0$

or

$\boxed{\textbf{(C) }1:-1:0}.$
