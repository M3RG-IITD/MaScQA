The maximum possible reduction Î”h in a single pass can be calculated using the formula:

$\Delta h = \frac{2 \mu R}{1-\mu^2} \ln \frac{h}{h_0}$

where R is the roll diameter and h0 is the initial thickness of the plate.

Plugging in the given values, we get:

$\Delta h = \frac{2 \times 0.1 \times 200}{1-0.1^2} \ln \frac{120}{120+2} \approx \boxed{17.6\ mm}$

Answer: [17.6 mm]
