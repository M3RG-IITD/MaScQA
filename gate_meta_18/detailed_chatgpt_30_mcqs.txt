We can use the Gauss divergence theorem to connect the surface integral to the volume integral. The Gauss divergence theorem states that the flux of a vector field $\vec{F}$ through a closed surface $S$ is equal to the volume integral of the divergence of the field over the enclosed volume $V$:

$$\oint_S \vec{F} \cdot d\vec{S} = \int_V \nabla \cdot \vec{F} \ dV$$

In this case, the vector field we are interested in is the electric field $\vec{E}$. We can use Gauss's law to find the electric field due to a point charge $Q$ at a distance $r$ from the charge:

$$\vec{E} = \frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r^2} \hat{r}$$

where $\hat{r}$ is the unit vector pointing from the charge toward the point at which we are measuring the field. Note that the electric field due to the positive charge points away from it, while the field due to the negative charge points toward it.

To find the electric field at a point on the sphere, we need to add up the fields due to the positive and negative charges. If we place the origin of our coordinate system at the center of the sphere, the positive charge is located at $\vec{r} = Q\hat{z}$ and the negative charge is located at $\vec{r} = -Q\hat{z}$. The distance from the center of the sphere to a point on the sphere is $r_i$, where $i$ can be 1, 2, or 3.

We can use the superposition principle to add up the fields due to the two charges. Since the charges are located on the $z$-axis, the electric field will also be along the $z$-axis, so we only need to consider the $z$-component of the field. The $z$-component of the electric field due to a point charge at $\vec{r} = (0, 0, d)$ is given by:

$$E_z = \frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 (d^2 + r_i^2 - 2dr_i \cos \theta_i)^{3/2}} (d - r_i \cos \theta_i)$$

where $\theta_i$ is the angle between the $z$-axis and the vector pointing from the charge to the point on the sphere.

To apply the divergence theorem, we need to find the divergence of the electric field. Since the electric field is only a function of $r$ and $\theta$ in spherical coordinates (and not $\phi$), the divergence simplifies to:

$$\nabla \cdot \vec{E} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} (r^2 E_r) + \frac{1}{r \sin \theta} \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} (\sin \theta E_{\theta}) + \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial}{\partial \phi} E_{\phi}$$

Since the electric field only has a $z$-component, the last term is zero. The first term is also zero, since $E_r = 0$ for a point charge. Therefore, we only need to find the second term:

$$\nabla \cdot \vec{E} = \frac{1}{r \sin \theta} \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} (\sin \theta E_{\theta}) = \frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r^3} \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} (\sin \theta (d - r_i \cos \theta_i))$$

Evaluating this derivative, we get:

$$\nabla \cdot \vec{E} = \frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r^3} (\cos \theta_i - 3\cos \theta_i \sin^2 \theta_i) = \frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r^3} \cos \theta_i (1 - 3\sin^2 \theta_i)$$

Now we can apply the divergence theorem to each sphere of radius $r_i$. The volume enclosed by each sphere is:

$$V_i = \frac{4}{3} \pi r_i^3$$

Using spherical symmetry, the flux through each sphere is the same, so we can write:

$$\oint_{S_i} \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{S} = E(r_i) (4\pi r_i^2) = \int_{V_i} \nabla \cdot \vec{E} \ dV$$

Substituting in our expressions for the electric field and divergence, and simplifying, we get:

$$\oint_{S_i} \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{S} = \frac{Q}{\epsilon_0} \left( 1 - \frac{3r_i^2}{d^2 + r_i^2} \right)$$

Now we just need to evaluate this expression for each value of $r_i$ and compare the ratios. The ratio $r_1:r_2:r_3$ is given as 1:2:5, so we can write $r_1 = r$, $r_2 = 2r$, $r_3 = 5r$ for some value of $r$. Substituting in these values, we get:

$$\oint_{S_1} \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{S} = \frac{Q}{\epsilon_0} \left( 1 - \frac{3r^2}{d^2 + r^2} \right)$$

$$\oint_{S_2} \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{S} = \frac{Q}{\epsilon_0} \left( 1 - \frac{12r^2}{4d^2 + 16r^2} \right)$$

$$\oint_{S_3} \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{S} = \frac{Q}{\epsilon_0} \left( 1 - \frac{75r^2}{25d^2 + 125r^2} \right)$$

Dividing each expression by $\frac{Q}{\epsilon_0}$ and simplifying, we get:

$$F_1 = 1 - \frac{3r^2}{d^2 + r^2}$$

$$F_2 = 1 - \frac{3r^2}{d^2 + 4r^2}$$

$$F_3 = 1 - \frac{3r^2}{d^2 + 25r^2}$$

Now we just need to find the ratio $F_1:F_2:F_3$. We can do this by dividing each expression by $F_1$ and simplifying:

$$\frac{F_2}{F_1} = \frac{1 - \frac{3r^2}{d^2 + 4r^2}}{1 - \frac{3r^2}{d^2 + r^2}} = \frac{d^2 + r^2 - 3r^2}{d^2 + r^2 - 3r^2/2} = \frac{2d^2 + r^2}{d^2 + r^2/2}$$

$$\frac{F_3}{F_1} = \frac{1 - \frac{3r^2}{d^2 + 25r^2}}{1 - \frac{3r^2}{d^2 + r^2}} = \frac{d^2 + r^2 - 3r^2/5}{d^2 + r^2 - 3r^2/2} = \frac{5d^2 + r^2}{d^2 + 2r^2}$$

Therefore, the ratio $F_1:F_2:F_3$ is:

$$\boxed{\textbf{(B) }5:2:1}$$
