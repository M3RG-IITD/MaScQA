To determine the correctness of the given assertion and reason, we first need to understand the phenomenon of Coble creep and the role of grain boundaries and dislocations in it.

Coble creep is a diffusion-controlled creep mechanism, which occurs at low stresses and high temperatures, typically for fine-grained polycrystalline materials. It is particularly significant for materials with a low stacking fault energy. Creep refers to plastic deformation of a material under constant stress at a high temperature.

In Coble creep, the grain boundaries play an essential role as they facilitate a diffusion mechanism for maintaining continuous deformation. As dislocations are less mobile at low stress and high temperatures, the material relies on this diffusion mechanism to accommodate the stress.

Now let's analyze the given Assertion [A] and Reason [R].

Assertion [A]: For a material exhibiting Coble creep, a reduction in grain size results in a significant increase in creep rate.

In Coble creep, grain size (d) is inversely proportional to the creep rate (dε/dt, where ε represents the strain). The relationship can be represented as:

(dε/dt) ∝ 1/d^3

A reduction in grain size (d) leads to an increase in the creep rate. Thus, assertion [A] is true.

Reason [R]: Grain boundaries act as a barrier to the motion of dislocations.

Grain boundaries do act as a barrier for the motion of dislocations, but they also facilitate diffusion-based creep deformation, such as Coble creep. Specifically, in the context of Coble creep, grain boundary diffusion and sliding are critical for enabling deformation. Thus, only considering grain boundaries as barriers for dislocation motion might not provide the appropriate explanation for assertion [A].

Therefore, option (B) is the correct choice, as both [A] and [R] are true statements, but [R] is not the correct reason for [A].

The answer is [(B)].
