Let's start solving the question step by step.

1. Identify Composite's Components
We have a carbon-fiber composite with 25% volume fraction of fibers (Vf) in an epoxy matrix. The Young's modulus of fiber (Ef) is 250 GPa, and the Young's modulus of the matrix (Em) is 2.5 GPa.

2. Determine the Rule of Mixtures for Longitudinal Loading (Iso-Strain Condition)
The Iso-Strain condition means that the strain in the fiber and the matrix are equal. The rule of mixtures for the composite's Young's modulus (Ec) can be expressed as:
Ec = Vf * Ef + (1 - Vf) * Em

3. Calculate the Composite's Young's Modulus (Ec)
Now, we can plug the values into the formula:
Ec = 0.25 * 250 + (1 - 0.25) * 2.5

Ec = 62.5 + 1.875 * 2.5
Ec = 62.5 + 4.6875
Ec = 67.1875 GPa

4. Determine the Load Sharing among Fiber and Matrix in Iso-Strain Condition
We need to find the stress in the fiber (σf) and the stress in the matrix (σm), which can be calculated using:
σf = Ef * ε
σm = Em * ε

Now, we know that the strain (ε) in both the fiber and the matrix is equal under the Iso-Strain condition. Therefore, we can express the stress ratio as:
(σf/σm) = (Ef/Em)

5. Calculate the Stress Ratio (σf/σm)
Now, we can plug the Young's modulus values into the stress ratio formula:
(σf/σm) = (250/2.5)

(σf/σm) = 100

6. Calculate the Fraction of Load Borne by the Reinforcement (fiber)
The total load borne by the composite (σc) is the sum of the loads borne by the fiber (σf) and the matrix (σm):
σc = σf + σm

The fraction of load borne by the fiber (σf/σc) can be calculated as:
σf/σc = σf / (σf + σm)

Using the stress ratio we calculated in step 5:
σf/σc = 100 / (100 + 1)

σf/σc ≈ 0.9901

7. Round off the Answer to Two Decimal Places
Now we round off the answer:
σf/σc ≈ 0.99

Answer: The fraction of load borne by the reinforcement (fiber) is approximately [0.99].
