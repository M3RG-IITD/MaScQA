To find the resolved shear stress on the given slip system, we will use the Schmid's Law formula: 

τ_resolved = σ_applied * cos(λ) * cos(ψ)

where τ_resolved is the resolved shear stress, σ_applied is the applied stress (in our case, 10 MPa), λ is the angle between the applied stress direction and the slip plane normal, and ψ is the angle between the applied stress direction and the slip direction.

First, we need to determine the unit vectors along the stress direction [321], the slip plane normal (111̅), and the slip direction [101]. 

The magnitudes of the unit vectors are:

|u_321| = √(3² + 2² + 1²) = √14

|u_111̅| = √(1² + 1² + 1̅²) = √3

|u_101| = √(1² + 0² + 1²) = √2

The unit vectors are:

u_321 = [3/√14, 2/√14, 1/√14]

u_111̅ = [1/√3, 1/√3, -1/√3]

u_101 = [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]

Next, we need to find the angles λ and ψ. 

cos(λ) = (u_321 • u_111̅) = (3/√14 * 1/√3) + (2/√14 * 1/√3) + (1/√14 * -1/√3) = (3 - 1)/(√14√3) = 2/(√42)

cos(ψ) = (u_321 • u_101) = (3/√14 * 1/√2) + (2/√14 * 0) + (1/√14 * 1/√2) = (3 + 1)/(√14√2) = 4/(√28)

Now, we plug these values into the Schmid's Law formula:

τ_resolved = 10 * (2/√42) * (4/√28) = 80/(√42 * √28)

Rounded off to two decimal places, we get τ_resolved ≈ 3.18 MPa.

Thus, the resolved shear stress on the (111̅) [101] slip system is approximately 3.18 MPa.

The correct answer is [3.18].
