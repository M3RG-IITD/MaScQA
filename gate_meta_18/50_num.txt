At a temperature of 710 K, the vapour pressure of pure liquid Zn is given by: $𝑝_(𝑍𝑛)(𝑋_(𝑧𝑛)$ = 1.0) = 3.6 * $10^(−4)$ atm. The Raoultian activity coefficient ($𝛾_(𝑍𝑛)$) of Zn in Zn-Cd alloy liquid at 710 K is approximated by: ln($𝛾_(𝑍𝑛)$) = 0.875 * $(1 − $𝑋_(𝑍𝑛)$)^2$. The ratio [$𝑝_(𝑍𝑛)(𝑋_(𝑧𝑛)=0.7)/𝑝_(𝑍𝑛)(𝑋_(𝑧𝑛)=1.0)$] for a liquid alloy with $𝑋_(𝑧𝑛)$ = 0.7 is?(upto two decimal places)
