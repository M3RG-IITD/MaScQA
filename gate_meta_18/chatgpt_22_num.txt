As per the given phase diagram, the 16% B composition falls inside the alpha phase region. The freezing range for a eutectic alloy is defined as the temperature range between the liquidus and solidus lines. Since, both the liquidus and solidus lines in the alpha phase are straight lines, the freezing range can be calculated by subtracting the temperature values at 0% and 100% A from the temperature value at 16% B. Using the diagram, we find that:

- Temperature at 0% A = 800°C
- Temperature at 100% A = 600°C
- Temperature at 16% B = 750°C

Freezing range = (temperature at 16% B - temperature at 0% A) - (temperature at 100% A - temperature at 0% A)

= (750°C - 800°C) - (600°C - 800°C)

= -50°C + 200°C

= 150°C

Therefore, the freezing range of the alloy with 16% B is 150°C.

Answer: [150°C]
