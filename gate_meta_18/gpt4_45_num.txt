We can use the equation for the terminal velocity of a sphere in a fluid (Stokes law), which is given by:

$$v = \frac{2}{9} \frac{(𝜌_p - 𝜌_f)gD^2}{18𝜇}$$

where:
$v$ = terminal velocity of the inclusion
$𝜌_p$ = density of the inclusion (2500 kg/m³)
$𝜌_f$ = density of the liquid steel (7900 kg/m³)
$g$ = acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s²)
$D$ = diameter of the inclusion (50 micrometers = 50 × 10⁻⁶ m)
$𝜇$ = viscosity of the liquid steel (0.0079 Pa s)

Plugging in the values:

$$v = \frac{2}{9} \frac{(2500 - 7900)(9.8)(50 \times 10^{-6})^2}{18(0.0079)}$$

$$v = - \frac{2}{9} \frac{(5400)(9.8)(50 \times 10^{-6})^2}{18(0.0079)}$$

$$v \approx -7.762 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{m/s}$$

Since the answer should be given in mm/s, we convert the final result as follows:

$$v \approx -7.762 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{m/s} \times \frac{1000 \, \text{mm}}{1 \, \text{m}} \approx -0.0776 \, \text{mm/s}$$

To two decimal places, the terminal velocity of the spherical inclusion is approximately -0.08 mm/s. The negative sign indicates that the inclusion is rising (moving upwards) in the liquid steel.

So the answer is: [-0.08]
