We are given:

- Interdiffusion coefficient for copper in aluminium at 500°C, D_500 = 4 * 10^(-14) m^2/s
- Interdiffusion coefficient for copper in aluminium at 600°C, D_600 = 8 * 10^(-13) m^2/s
- Time for isothermal treatment at 600°C, t_600 = 10 hours
- We are to find the time required to achieve the same concentration profile at 500°C, which we will call t_500.

The concentration profile depends on the diffusion process, which is directly proportional to the product of the diffusion coefficient and time (D*t). Therefore, we can write the following equation:

D_500 * t_500 = D_600 * t_600

We can now solve for t_500:

t_500 = (D_600 * t_600) / D_500

First, we need to convert the given time from hours to seconds:

t_600 = 10 hours * (3600 s/hour) = 36000 s

Now we can plug in the given values:

t_500 = (8 * 10^(-13) m^2/s * 36000 s) / (4 * 10^(-14) m^2/s)

t_500 = (8/4) * (10^(-13)/10^(-14)) * 36000
t_500 = 2 * 10 * 36000
t_500 = 720000 s

Now, converting back to hours:

t_500 = 720000 s * (1 hour / 3600 s) = 200 hours

Therefore, it takes 200 hours to achieve the same concentration profile at 500°C.

Answer: [200].
