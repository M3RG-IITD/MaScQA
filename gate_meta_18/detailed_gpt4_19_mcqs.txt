To answer this question, let's first understand what each of these non-destructive testing techniques is used for:

(A) Dye penetrant test: This method is used to reveal surface defects and discontinuities in non-porous materials like metals, plastics, and ceramics. It involves applying a colored liquid (dye) to the surface of the material, allowing it to seep into any surface-breaking defects, and then wiping away excess dye. A developer is then applied, and the defects become visible due to the contrast between the dye and the developer. However, this technique is not suitable for detecting subsurface defects, and it is not suitable for detecting defects in pipeline internals.

(B) Magnetic particle inspection: This technique is used to detect surface and near-surface defects in ferromagnetic materials like iron, nickel, and cobalt. The material is magnetized, and a magnetic suspension or powder is applied to the surface. The magnetic particles accumulate at the areas where magnetic flux leakage occurs due to the presence of a defect, revealing the location of the defect. While this technique can be effective for detecting surface defects, it is not suitable for detecting defects in pipeline internals or for quantifying the thickness of the scale layer.

(C) Ultrasonic inspection: Ultrasonic testing uses high-frequency sound waves to detect defects within a material or at the interface between different materials. This technique can detect both surface and subsurface defects and can also be used to measure the thickness of a material or the depth of a defect. Ultrasonic testing can be performed on a variety of materials, including metals, plastics, and ceramics, making it a versatile option for detecting and quantifying defects such as corrosion or scaling in a steel pipeline.

(D) Acoustic emission: Acoustic emission testing involves listening for sound waves produced by the movement of dislocations or the formation and propagation of cracks within a material undergoing stress. While this technique can be useful for monitoring the condition of a material over time, it may not be the best choice for detecting and quantifying the presence of scale within the pipeline.

Based on this information, the most suitable non-destructive technique for detecting and quantifying the suspected scale on the inner surface of the steel pipeline is:
