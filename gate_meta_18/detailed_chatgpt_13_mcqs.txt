The electrical conductivity of a material is given by the equation:

σ = nqμn + pqp

Where n is the electron concentration, p is the hole concentration, q is the charge of an electron, μn is the electron mobility, and μp is the hole mobility.

Substituting the given values:

n = p = 1 * $10^(16)m^(-3)$
q = 1.6 * $10^(-19)$ C
μn = 0.1 $m^2.V^(-1).s^(-1)$
μp = 0.2 $m^2.V^(-1).s^(-1)$

σ = (1 * $10^(16)m^(-3)$)(1.6 * $10^(-19)$ C)(0.1 $m^2.V^(-1).s^(-1)$) + (1 * $10^(16)m^(-3)$)(1.6 * $10^(-19)$ C)(0.2 $m^2.V^(-1).s^(-1)$)

σ = 2.56 * $10^(-3)(Ω.m)^(-1)$

Therefore, the answer is (C) 3.2* $10^(-4)(Ω.m)^(-1)$.
