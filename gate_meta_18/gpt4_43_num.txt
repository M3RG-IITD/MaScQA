We'll use the 1-D heat transfer equation to solve this problem.

The 1-D heat transfer equation is given by:

q = k * (ΔT / d)

where q is the heat transfer rate, k is the thermal conductivity, ΔT is the temperature difference, and d is the distance.

Considering the shrinkage defects occur at distance L1 from Mold-1 and L2 from Mold-2, we can write two equations for heat transfer:

$q_1$ = $k_1$ * (ΔT / L1)
$q_2$ = $k_2$ * (ΔT / L2)

Since the same amount of heat is transferred between the two molds, we can equate $q_1$ and $q_2$:

$k_1$ * (ΔT / L1) = $k_2$ * (ΔT / L2)

We are given the ratio L1:L2 = 3:2. Let's write this ratio as:

L1 = 3x
L2 = 2x

Now we can plug these values into our equation and solve for the ratio ($k_1$/$k_2$):

$k_1$ * (ΔT / (3x)) = $k_2$ * (ΔT / (2x))

Cancelling ΔT from both sides and solving for ($k_1$/$k_2$):

($k_1$/$k_2$) * (2x / 3x) = 1

Since x is nonzero, it cancels out:

($k_1$/$k_2$) * (2/3) = 1

Now, solving for ($k_1$/$k_2$):

($k_1$/$k_2$) = 3/2

Thus, the ratio ($k_1$/$k_2$) is [3/2].
