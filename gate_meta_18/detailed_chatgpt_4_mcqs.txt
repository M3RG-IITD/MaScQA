Froth flotation is a process for selectively separating hydrophobic materials from hydrophilic ones. In this process, various chemicals, called collectors, are added to make the mineral surfaces hydrophobic, and air is bubbled through the mixture to create bubbles that stick to the hydrophobic mineral particles, which rise to the top of the flotation cell as froth for further processing. 

Therefore, the primary purpose of adding collectors is to make the surface of the mineral hydrophobic. 

Hence, the answer is (A) make the surface of the mineral hydrophobic.
