A continuous and aligned carbon-fiber composite consists of 25 vol. % of fibers in an epoxy matrix. The Young’s modulus of fiber and matrix, respectively are $𝐸_𝑓$ = 250 GPa and $𝐸_𝑚$ = 2.5 GPa. If the composite is subjected to longitudinal loading (iso-strain condition and assuming elastic response), what is the fraction of load borne by the reinforcement rounded off to two decimal places?
