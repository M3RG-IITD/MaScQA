The Gauss divergence theorem states that:

$‚àÆ_S (E ‚àô ùëõÃÇ )dS = \frac{Q_{enclosed}}{\epsilon_0}$

where $Q_{enclosed}$ is the net enclosed charge inside the sphere.

For $F_1$, since the surface encloses both +Q and -Q charges, the net enclosed charge is 0. Therefore, $F_1 = 0$.

For $F_2$, the surface encloses only the +Q charge, so $Q_{enclosed} = Q$. Thus,

$F_2 = \frac{Q}{\epsilon_0}$

For $F_3$, the surface encloses both charges, so the net enclosed charge is again 0, and $F_3 = 0$.

So the ratio of $F_1 : F_2 : F_3 = 0 : \frac{Q}{\epsilon_0} : 0$.

It appears most similar to the option (D) 1 : 1 : 0. However, since the ratios of the fields are in terms of Q and Œµ0, we can also write the ratio as:

$F_1 : F_2 : F_3 = 0 : 1 : 0$

Thus, the correct answer is (D) 1 : 1 : 0.
