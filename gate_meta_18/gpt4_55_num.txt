To find the ideal plastic work involved in the extrusion process, we can use the equation:

Work = (Flow Stress) x (Volume Reduction Ratio - 1) x (Initial Volume)

First, we need to find the initial and final volumes of the cylindrical billet.
Initial Volume (V1) = π x (Initial Diameter / 2)^2 x Length
Final Volume (V2) = π x (Final Diameter / 2)^2 x Length

Initial Volume: V1 = π x (20 mm / 2)^2 x 100 mm = 1000π mm^3
Final Volume: V2 = π x (16 mm / 2)^2 x 100 mm = 640π mm^3

Now, let's find the Volume Reduction Ratio (VRR):
VRR = V1 / V2 = 1000π mm^3 / 640π mm^3 = 25/16

Now we can find the ideal plastic work:
Work = (Flow Stress) x (VRR - 1) x (Initial Volume)
Work = (40 MPa) x (25/16 - 1) x (1000π mm^3)

First, let's convert the flow stress to N/mm^2:
40 MPa = 40 N/mm^2

Now, let's calculate the ideal plastic work:
Work = (40 N/mm^2) x (9/16) x (1000π mm^3) = 2250π N·mm

Since 1 N·mm = 1 J (Joule), the ideal plastic work involved in extruding the cylindrical billet is:

Work = 2250π J

To convert this answer to one decimal place, we calculate:

Work ≈ 2250 x 3.14 J ≈ 7065 J

So, the ideal plastic work is [7065] J to one decimal place.
