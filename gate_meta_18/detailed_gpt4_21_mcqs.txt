To determine the equilibrium condition at a triple junction, we need to consider the forces acting on each grain boundary and the balance at the junction. The forces acting on each grain boundary are given by the grain boundary tension ($γ$) multiplied by the force component perpendicular to the angle between the adjacent grain boundaries.

Let's consider the forces acting on the grain boundaries:

1. On the boundary between grains 1 and 2, the force is given by $γ_{12}$ and acts perpendicular to the angle $θ_3$.
2. On the boundary between grains 2 and 3, the force is given by $γ_{23}$ and acts perpendicular to the angle $θ_1$.
3. On the boundary between grains 1 and 3, the force is given by $γ_{13}$ and acts perpendicular to the angle $θ_2$.

For equilibrium at the triple junction, the forces must balance along each direction:

(1) $γ_{12}\cos(θ_3) = γ_{23}\cos(θ_1)$
(2) $γ_{23}\cos(θ_1) = γ_{13}\cos(θ_2)$
(3) $γ_{12}\cos(θ_3) = γ_{13}\cos(θ_2)$

Combining equations (1) and (2), we get:

$γ_{23}/\cos(θ_1) = γ_{13}/\cos(θ_2)$

And combining equations (1) and (3), we get:

$γ_{23}/\cos(θ_1) = γ_{12}/\cos(θ_3)$

So the equilibrium condition is:

$γ_{23}/\cos(θ_1) = γ_{13}/\cos(θ_2) = γ_{12}/\cos(θ_3)$

This corresponds to option (A). Therefore, the correct answer is [A].
