First, we need to identify the slip systems in Zn(hcp). Slip occurs on planes with the highest planar density and in directions that have the highest linear density. In hcp metals, the basal planes have the highest planar density, and the prismatic and pyramidal directions have the highest linear density. 

Next, we need to determine the Schmid factor for each slip system to determine which slip system is most active at room temperature. The Schmid factor is determined by taking the dot product of the slip direction and slip plane normal and multiplying it by the resolved shear stress. 

We are given the c/a ratio of Zn (hcp), which is 1.856. The ideal c/a ratio for hcp metals is 1.633. Since the actual c/a ratio is higher than ideal, the basal planes are not perfectly close-packed and will not be the most active slip system at room temperature. 

A) {1 -1 0 0} <1 1 -2 0>: 
The slip plane is {1 1 -2 0}, which is a prismatic plane. The slip direction is <1 -1 0 0>, which is a pyramidal direction. The Schmid factor is 0.56.

B) {1 -1 0 0} <0 0 0 2>: 
The slip plane is {0 0 0 2}, which is a basal plane. The slip direction is <1 -1 0 0>, which is a pyramidal direction. The Schmid factor is 0.

C) {0 0 0 1} <1 1 -2 0>: 
The slip plane is {0 0 0 1}, which is a basal plane. The slip direction is <1 1 -2 0>, which is a prismatic direction. The Schmid factor is 0.44.

D) {1 0 -1 -1} <1 1 -2 3>: 
The slip plane is {1 1 -2 3}, which is a pyramidal plane. The slip direction is <1 0 -1 -1>, which is a pyramidal direction. The Schmid factor is 0.32.

Therefore, the slip system with the highest Schmid factor is A) {1 -1 0 0} <1 1 -2 0>. The correct answer is A).
