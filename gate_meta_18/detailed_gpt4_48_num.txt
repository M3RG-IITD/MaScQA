To find the total entropy of mixing, we will use the formula:

ΔS_mix = - n_A * R * x_A * ln(x_A) - n_B * R * x_B * ln(x_B)

where,
ΔS_mix = total entropy of mixing
n_A and n_B are the moles of Au and Ag, respectively.
x_A and x_B are the mole fractions of Au and Ag, respectively.
R is the gas constant, 8.314 J $K^(-1)mol^(-1)$

First, we need to calculate the mole fractions x_A and x_B:

Total moles = moles of Au + moles of Ag = 2 + 3 = 5 moles

x_A = moles of Au/Total moles = 2/5
x_B = moles of Ag/Total moles = 3/5

Now, we can substitute the values into the entropy formula:

ΔS_mix = - (2) * (8.314) * (2/5) * ln(2/5) - (3) * (8.314) * (3/5) * ln(3/5)

Now, we will solve the equation step by step:

ΔS_mix = - (2) * (8.314) * (2/5) * ln(2/5) - (3) * (8.314) * (3/5) * ln(3/5)

ΔS_mix = -16.628 * (2/5) * ln(2/5) - 24.942 * (3/5) * ln(3/5)

ΔS_mix = -6.6512 * ln(2/5) - 14.9652 * ln(3/5)

Using the natural logarithm values:
ln(2/5) ≈ -0.9163
ln(3/5) ≈ -0.5108

ΔS_mix = -6.6512 * (-0.9163) - 14.9652 * (-0.5108)

ΔS_mix ≈ 6.0926 + 7.6484

ΔS_mix ≈ 13.7410

Finally, rounding off to one decimal place, the total entropy of mixing is 13.7 J K-1.

The correct answer is [13.7].
