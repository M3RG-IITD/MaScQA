P - Arc welding produces a heat-affected zone which is vulnerable to solidification cracks. This type of crack is an example of a Liquation crack.

Q - Extrusion is the process of reducing the cross-sectional area of a workpiece in which an initial billet is formed through a continuous process. This process can lead to a Chevron crack which is one of the most commonly observed types of cracking in extrusion processes.

R - Drawing refers to a process where a sheet or bar is pulled through a die until it reaches the required size. This process causes an Edge crack to happen, which is due to the excessive plastic deformation that the material undergoes during the process.

S - Rolling as a manufacturing process, involves compressing a material between two rotating rolls, it also surfaces unsuitable for subsequent processing. In this process, Surface cracks are common, which may result from surface tearing or surface splits.

Therefore, the correct answer is: (B) P-1, Q-3, R-4, S-2.
