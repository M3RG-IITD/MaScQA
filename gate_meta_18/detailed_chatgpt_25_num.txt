We can use Fick's second law of diffusion to solve this problem, which is given by:

$$\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} = D \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial x^2}$$

where C is the concentration, t is time, x is the distance, and D is the diffusion coefficient.

Assuming one-dimensional steady-state diffusion, we can write:

$$J = -D \frac{\partial C}{\partial x} = -constant$$

where J is the diffusion flux.

Since we are looking for the time required to achieve the same concentration profile at 500°C, we can use the fact that the flux is constant at both temperatures. This means that:

$$J_{500} = J_{600}$$

From Fick's first law of diffusion, we know that:

$$J = -D \frac{\Delta C}{\Delta x}$$

where $\Delta C$ and $\Delta x$ are the concentration and distance differences, respectively.

Assuming that $\Delta x$ is the same at both temperatures, we can write:

$$J_{500} = -D_{500} \frac{\Delta C}{\Delta x} = -D_{600} \frac{\Delta C}{\Delta x} = J_{600}$$

Rearranging, we get:

$$\frac{D_{600}}{D_{500}} = \frac{1}{8}$$

Therefore, the time required to achieve the same concentration profile at 500°C can be found using the relationship between diffusion coefficient and temperature given by the Arrhenius equation:

$$D = D_0 e^{-\frac{Q}{RT}}$$

where $D_0$ is a constant, Q is the activation energy, R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature.

Dividing the above equation by D0 and taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we obtain:

$$\ln{\frac{D}{D_0}} = -\frac{Q}{RT}$$

Taking the ratio of the above equation at 500°C and 600°C, we obtain:

$$\ln{\frac{D_{500}}{D_0}} - \ln{\frac{D_{600}}{D_0}} = \frac{Q}{R}(\frac{1}{T_{600}}-\frac{1}{T_{500}})$$

Substituting the given values, we get:

$$\ln{\frac{4 \times 10^{-14}}{D_0}} - \ln{\frac{8 \times 10^{-13}}{D_0}} = \frac{Q}{R}(\frac{1}{873}-\frac{1}{773})$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$Q = 1.56 \times 10^5 J/mol$$

Substituting this value along with the given temperatures, we get:

$$\ln{\frac{D_{500}}{D_0}} = -\frac{Q}{R}\frac{1}{T_{500}} = -77.6$$

Taking the exponential of both sides, we get:

$$\frac{D_{500}}{D_0} = e^{-77.6} = 1.48 \times 10^{-34}$$

Finally, we use Fick's second law of diffusion to find the time required to achieve the same concentration profile at 500°C:

$$\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} = D_{500} \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial x^2}$$

Since $\frac{\partial C}{\partial t}$ and $\frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial x^2}$ are the same at both temperatures, we can write:

$$\frac{D_{500}}{D_{600}} = \frac{t_{500}}{t_{600}}$$

Substituting the given values, we get:

$$\frac{1.48 \times 10^{-34}}{8 \times 10^{-13}} = \frac{t_{500}}{10}$$

Solving for $t_{500}$, we get:

$$t_{500} = 1.85 \times 10^{-23} \text{ hours}$$

Therefore, the answer is:

- $t_{500} = 1.85 \times 10^{-23}$ hours
