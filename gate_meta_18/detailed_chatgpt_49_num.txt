We will use the Stefan-Boltzmann law to determine the rate of heat transfer from the droplet to the gas stream. The rate of heat transfer is given by:

$$\frac{dQ}{dt} = hA(T_m - T_g)$$

where $h$ is the convective heat transfer coefficient, $A$ is the surface area of the droplet, $T_m$ is the melting temperature of the metal, and $T_g$ is the temperature of the gas stream. The surface area of a sphere is given by:

$$A = 4\pi r^2$$

where $r$ is the radius of the sphere. Substituting $r = 0.5 mm$ and $T_g = 300 K$, we have:

$$A = 4\pi(0.5 \times 10^{-3})^2 = 3.14 \times 10^{-6}\ m^2$$

Now we need to determine the mass of the droplet. The density of the liquid metal is given as $2700\ kg\ m^{-3}$. The volume of a sphere is given by:

$$V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$$

Substituting $r = 0.5 mm$, we have:

$$V = \frac{4}{3}\pi(0.5 \times 10^{-3})^3 = 5.24 \times 10^{-10}\ m^3$$

The mass of the droplet is given by:

$$m = \rho V = 2700 \times 5.24 \times 10^{-10} = 1.42 \times 10^{-6}\ kg$$

The latent heat of fusion of the metal is given as $4000\ kJ\ kg^{-1}$. Since the droplet remains at its melting point, all the heat transferred from the droplet to the gas stream is used for melting the metal. The amount of heat required to melt the droplet is:

$$Q = mL = (1.42 \times 10^{-6}\ kg)(4000\ kJ\ kg^{-1}) = 5.68\ J$$

Substituting the given values, we have:

$$\frac{dQ}{dt} = (200\ W\ m^{-2}K^{-1})(3.14 \times 10^{-6}\ m^2)(900 - 300)\ K = 904.8\ W$$

Equating the rate of heat transfer with the amount of heat required to melt the droplet, we have:

$$\frac{dQ}{dt} = 904.8 = \frac{5.68}{t}$$

Solving for $t$, we get:

$$t = \frac{5.68}{904.8} = 0.0063\ s$$

Therefore, the time taken to solidify the droplet is 0.0063 seconds. Answer: [0.0063]
