From the given temperature profile, we can set up the equation:

1500 = 2000 * exp(-0.3*$x^2$)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

0.75 = exp(-0.3*$x^2$)

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get:

ln(0.75) = -0.3*$x^2$

Solving for x, we get:

x = sqrt(ln(0.75)/(-0.3))

x â‰ˆ 4.02 mm (rounded to two decimal places)

Therefore, the width of the fusion zone is approximately 8.04 mm (twice the value of x).

Answer: [8.04 mm]
