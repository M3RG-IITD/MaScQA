The diffusion coefficient is temperature-dependent and can be given by the Arrhenius equation:

$D = D_0 \exp{(-\frac{Q}{RT})}$

where D is the diffusion coefficient, D0 is a constant, Q is the activation energy for diffusion, R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature.

Taking the ratio of the diffusion coefficient at 600°C and 500°C:

$\frac{D_{600}}{D_{500}} = \frac{8 \times 10^{-13}}{4 \times 10^{-14}} = 20$

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

$\ln(\frac{D_{600}}{D_{500}}) = \ln(20)$

Using the Arrhenius equation:

$\ln(\frac{D_{600}}{D_{500}}) = \ln(\frac{D_{0,600}}{D_{0,500}}) - \frac{Q}{R}(\frac{1}{T_{600}} - \frac{1}{T_{500}})$

Assuming that the activation energy is the same at both temperatures and cancelling out the common term:

$\ln(20) = -\frac{Q}{R}(\frac{1}{873} - \frac{1}{773})$

Solving for Q:

$Q = \frac{R\ln(20)}{\frac{1}{873} - \frac{1}{773}} \approx 132,929$ J/mol

Using Fick's second law:

$c = c_0(1 - \frac{x}{L})$

where c is the concentration at a distance x from the interface, c0 is the initial concentration of copper, and L is the diffusion length given by:

$L = \sqrt{Dt}$

where D is the diffusion coefficient and t is the time.

Since the concentration profile is the same at both temperatures, we can write:

$\frac{L_{600}}{\sqrt{t_{600}}} = \frac{L_{500}}{\sqrt{t_{500}}}$

Substituting for L:

$\frac{\sqrt{D_{0,600}t_{600}}}{\sqrt{D_{600}}} = \frac{\sqrt{D_{0,500}t_{500}}}{\sqrt{D_{500}}}$

Squaring both sides and simplifying:

$\frac{t_{500}}{t_{600}} = (\frac{D_{600}}{D_{500}})^2 \frac{D_{0,600}}{D_{0,500}} \approx 400$

Therefore, the time required to achieve the same concentration profile at 500°C is:

$t_{500} = t_{600} \frac{D_{500}}{D_{600}} (\frac{D_{0,500}}{D_{0,600}})^{1/2} \approx 4000$ hours, or 166.7 days (to 1 decimal place)

Answer: [4000 hours, 166.7 days]
