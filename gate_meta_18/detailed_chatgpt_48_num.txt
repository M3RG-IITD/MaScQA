The entropy of mixing can be calculated using the formula:

$\Delta S_{mix} = -R\sum_{i}x_i\ln{x_i}$

where $x_i$ is the mole fraction of the i-th component, and R is the gas constant.

For this problem, we can find the mole fractions of Au and Ag as follows:

Mole fraction of Au, $x_{Au} = 2/5 = 0.4$

Mole fraction of Ag, $x_{Ag} = 3/5 = 0.6$

Therefore, the entropy of mixing can be calculated as:

$\Delta S_{mix} = -R(x_{Au}\ln{x_{Au}} + x_{Ag}\ln{x_{Ag}})$

Substituting the values:

$\Delta S_{mix} = -8.314(0.4\ln{0.4} + 0.6\ln{0.6})$

$\Delta S_{mix} = -8.314(0.4(-0.916) + 0.6(-0.511))$

$\Delta S_{mix} = -8.314(-0.638) = 5.309$

Rounding off to one decimal place, the total entropy of mixing is:

$\Delta S_{mix} = 5.3 J K^{-1}$

Therefore, the correct answer is:

- 5.3 J K^{-1}
