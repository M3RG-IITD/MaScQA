The exact differential of Gibbs free energy G for a single-phase system with K components is given as:

dG = -SdT + VdP + Σ(μ_i dn_i)

where S is the entropy, T is the temperature, V is the volume, P is the pressure, μ_i is the chemical potential, and n_i is the mole number of the i-th component.

Applying the general formula for thermodynamic potentials (∂X/∂Y)|$_(Z,W)$  = (∂W/∂Z)|$_(Y,X)$, we can derive Maxwell's relations for the system.

Consider the relation:

(∂S/∂P)|$_(T,n_i)$ = -(∂V/∂T)|$_(P,n_i)$

Comparing this to the general equation, we have:

X = S, Y = P, Z = T, W = V

Now we check if the corresponding partial derivatives match in the Gibbs free energy expression:

- (∂G/∂T)|$_(P,n_i)$ = -S
- (∂G/∂P)|$_(T,n_i)$ = V

Since the corresponding partial derivatives match with our chosen relation, we can say that the Maxwell's relation is valid for the given system.

So the correct answer is:
