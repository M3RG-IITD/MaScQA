To determine if the fiber will undergo fracture, we need to determine the critical stress, which can be found using Griffith's theory of brittle fracture. According to Modified Griffith's theory, the critical stress for fracture (σ_c) in a material with flaws can be given as:

σ_c = √(2 * E * γ / π * a)

where:
E is the elastic modulus
γ is the surface energy
a is the length of the most significant flaw (the largest flaw)

We are given:
E = 70 GPa = 70 * 10^9 Pa
γ = 0.3 J/m^2 = 0.3 N/m
Tensile stress, σ = 20 MPa = 20 * 10^6 Pa

However, we do not know the length of the largest flaw (a). To account for this unknown variable, we can analyze the given tensile stress (20 MPa) and compare it with the critical stress (σ_c).

If σ > σ_c, the fiber undergoes brittle fracture.
If σ < σ_c, the fiber does not undergo fracture.

(1) Calculate σ_c / σ:

σ_c / σ = √(2 * E * γ / π * a * σ)

(2) Rearrange this expression to solve for the value of the unknown 'a':

a = 2 * E * γ / (π * σ^2)

(3) Substitute the known values:

a = 2 * (70 * 10^9 Pa) * (0.3 N/m) / (π * (20 * 10^6 Pa)^2)

a = 6 * 10^10 Nm / 1.256 * 10^13

a ≈ 4.78 * 10^(-3) m

Now, we can compare the tensile stress (σ = 20 MPa) with the critical stress (σ_c):

σ_c = √(2 * (70 * 10^9 Pa) * (0.3 N/m) / π * (4.78 * 10^(-3) m)) ≈ 38.7 MPa

Since σ < σ_c (20 MPa < 38.7 MPa), the fiber does not undergo brittle fracture but undergoes elastic deformation without fracture. Also, the fiber is subjected to tensile stress which doesn't contribute to buckling. Thus, the correct answer is:

[C] The fibre will undergo elastic deformation, but not fracture

Answer: [C]
