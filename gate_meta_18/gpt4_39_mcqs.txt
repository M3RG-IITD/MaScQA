The energy barrier for homogeneous nucleation can be expressed as:

ΔG = (16π/3) * (γ^3 / (Tm * ΔH * (ΔT/Tm)^2))

where ΔG is the energy barrier, γ is the solid-liquid interfacial energy, Tm is the melting temperature, ΔH is the enthalpy change, and ΔT is the temperature difference between the melting temperature Tm and the liquid state.

If the solid-liquid interfacial energy γ increases by 10%, the new energy barrier ΔG' will be:

ΔG' = (16π/3) * ((1.1 * γ)^3 / (Tm * ΔH * (ΔT/Tm)^2))

ΔG' = (16π/3) * (1.1^3 * γ^3 / (Tm * ΔH * (ΔT/Tm)^2))

Now, we can calculate the percentage change in the energy barrier:

% change = (ΔG' - ΔG) / ΔG * 100

% change = ((1.1^3 * γ^3 - γ^3) / γ^3) * 100

% change = (1.1^3 - 1) * 100

% change = (1.331 - 1) * 100

% change = 0.331 * 100

% change = 33%

So, the correct answer is (B) 33%.
