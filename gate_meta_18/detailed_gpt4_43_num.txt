To solve this problem, we will use Fourier's Law of thermal conduction.

Fourier's Law states that the rate of heat transfer (Q) through a solid is proportional to the temperature difference (ΔT) and the cross-sectional area (A) perpendicular to the direction of heat transfer, and inversely proportional to the distance (d) that the heat must travel through the solid. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

Q = -kA(ΔT/d)

where k is the thermal conductivity of the material.

We are given the distances L1 and L2 and asked to find the ratio of thermal conductivities k1 and k2. Let's consider the heat transfer from Mould 1 and Mould 2 to the alloy:

Q1 = -k1A(ΔT/L1)
Q2 = -k2A(ΔT/L2)

Since the alloy is cast in steady-state condition, we can assume that the rate of heat transfer (Q) is the same for both moulds:

Q1 = Q2

So, we can write:

-k1A(ΔT/L1) = -k2A(ΔT/L2)

Now, we can solve for the ratio (k1/k2):

(k1/k2) = (L1/L2)

Given that the ratio L1:L2 = 3:2, we can write:

(k1/k2) = 3/2

So, the ratio (k1/k2) is 3/2.

Answer: [\( \frac{k_1}{k_2} = \frac{3}{2} \)]
