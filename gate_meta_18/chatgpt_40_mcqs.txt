We can use the formula for volumetric strain in terms of bulk modulus: 

𝛥 = -V/V₀ = -(1/K) $\times$ ΔP/P₀ 

Where V₀ and P₀ are the initial volume and pressure, ΔP is the change in pressure, and V is the final volume. 

Here, we are given 𝛥 and we can assume ΔP = P. Also, since the stress state is hydrostatic, we have P = -1/3 $\times$ σ. Substituting these values, we get: 

3.5 × $10^{-4}$ = (1/K) $\times$ (1/3 σ/σ)

Simplifying, we get: 

K = 3 $\times$ σ/𝛥

From the stress-strain diagram, we can see that the stress at the point of interest is approximately 500 MPa. Substituting this value, we get: 

K = 3 $\times$ 500 MPa/3.5 × $10^{-4}$ = 428.57 GPa

Rounding off to the nearest option, we get the answer as (D) 400 GPa. 

Answer: 
(D) 400 GPa
