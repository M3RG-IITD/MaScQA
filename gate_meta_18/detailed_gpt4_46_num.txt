We are given the applied stress along direction [321] and we need to find out the resolved shear stress on the slip system (1 1 -1) [101]. To do that, we will follow these steps:

1. Find out the direction cosines for direction [321].
2. Find out the direction cosines for direction [101].
3. Calculate the normal stress on the slip plane (1 1 -1).
4. Calculate the resolved stress in the slip direction [101] on the slip plane
5. Calculate the resolved shear stress.

Step 1: Find the direction cosines for direction [321].

The direction cosines can be found using the formula, cos α = (h/sqrt(h^2+k^2+l^2)), where [hkl] are the Miller Indices of the planes.

For [321], we have h=3, k=2, and l=1

cos α1 = (3/sqrt((3^2)+(2^2)+(1^2))) = 3/sqrt(14)
cos β1 = (2/sqrt((3^2)+(2^2)+(1^2))) = 2/sqrt(14)
cos γ1 = (1/sqrt((3^2)+(2^2)+(1^2))) = 1/sqrt(14)

Step 2: Find the direction cosines for direction [101].

For [101], we have h=1, k=0, and l=1

cos α2 = (1/sqrt((1^2)+(0^2)+(1^2))) = 1/sqrt(2)
cos β2 = (0/sqrt((1^2)+(0^2)+(1^2))) = 0/sqrt(2)
cos γ2 = (1/sqrt((1^2)+(0^2)+(1^2))) = 1/sqrt(2)

Step 3: Calculate the normal stress on the slip plane (1 1 -1).

The normal stress on the slip plane can be calculated as
σ = T * (cos α1 * cos α2 + cos β1 * cos β2 + cos γ1 * cos γ2)

σ = 10 * ( (3/sqrt(14) * 1/sqrt(2)) + (2/sqrt(14) * 0/sqrt(2)) + (1/sqrt(14) * 1/sqrt(2)) )
σ = 10 * ( (3 + 1)/(sqrt(14)*sqrt(2)) )

Step 4: Calculate the resolved stress in the slip direction [101] on the slip plane.

To do that, we will calculate the angle θ between the direction [321] and [101], and then calculate the resolved stress as σ*cosθ.

cos θ = cos α1 * cos α2 + cos β1 * cos β2 + cos γ1 * cos γ2
cos θ = (3/sqrt(14) * 1/sqrt(2)) + (2/sqrt(14) * 0/sqrt(2)) + (1/sqrt(14) * 1/sqrt(2))
cos θ = (3 + 1) / (sqrt(14)*sqrt(2))

The resolved stress in the slip direction [101] = σ*cos θ = σ

So, the resolved stress σ' = σ = 10 * ( (3 + 1)/(sqrt(14)*sqrt(2)) )

Step 5: Calculate the resolved shear stress.

The resolved shear stress τ = 0.5 * σ'

τ = 0.5 * 10 * ( (3 + 1)/(sqrt(14)*sqrt(2)) )
τ ≈ 1.789

So, the resolved shear stress τ ≈ 1.79 MPa (rounded off to two decimal places).

The correct answer is [1.79].
