We can use the equation for maximum possible reduction (Δh) in a single pass in cold rolling:

Δh = (μ/2)*(D^2/h)

where μ is the coefficient of friction, D is the roll diameter and h is the thickness of the plate.

Plugging in the given values, we get:

Δh = (0.1/2)*(200^2/120) = 16.7 mm (to one decimal place)

Therefore, the maximum possible reduction in a single pass is 16.7 mm.

Answer: [16.7]
