First, we need to calculate the volume of the unit cell for both BCC and FCC structures:

For BCC, the unit cell contains 2 atoms, and the lattice parameter is given as 0.293 nm. The volume of the unit cell can be calculated as:

V_BCC = a^3 * (2 atoms per unit cell)
V_BCC = (0.293 nm)^3 * 2
V_BCC = 0.024 nm^3

For FCC, the unit cell contains 4 atoms, and the lattice parameter is given as 0.363 nm. The volume of the unit cell can be calculated as:

V_FCC = a^3 * (4 atoms per unit cell)
V_FCC = (0.363 nm)^3 * 4
V_FCC = 0.050 nm^3

Now, we can calculate the percentage change in volume as:

% change in volume = (V_FCC - V_BCC) / V_BCC * 100%
% change in volume = (0.050 nm^3 - 0.024 nm^3) / 0.024 nm^3 * 100%
% change in volume = 108.3%

Therefore, the associated volume change is 108.3% rounded off to one decimal place.
