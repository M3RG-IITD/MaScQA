We can find the wavelength of X-rays in nm using Bragg's Law, which states that:

n * λ = 2 * d * sin(θ),

where:
n = order of reflection (in our case, n = 1 since it is the first peak),
λ = wavelength of X-rays in nm,
d = interplanar spacing of BCC lattice in nm,
θ = angle of diffraction, which is half of the given angle (2θ) in our problem.

We are given 2θ = 68.7°, so we can calculate θ as follows:

θ = (1/2) * 2θ = (1/2) * 68.7° = 34.35°.

Now, we need to find the interplanar spacing d for the BCC lattice. For a BCC lattice, the relationship between the lattice parameter a and interplanar spacing d is given by:

d = a * sqrt(3) / sqrt(h^2 + k^2 + l^2),

where:
a = lattice parameter of iron (given as 0.287 nm),
h, k, and l = Miller indices representing the crystal planes.

For the first peak in a BCC lattice, the Miller indices are (1, 1, 0). Therefore, we have h = 1, k = 1, and l = 0. We can now substitute these values to calculate d:

d = 0.287 * sqrt(3) / sqrt(1^2 + 1^2 + 0^2) = 0.287 * sqrt(3) / sqrt(2).

Now, we can use Bragg's Law to find the wavelength λ:

1 * λ = 2 * (0.287 * sqrt(3) / sqrt(2)) * sin(34.35°).

Rearranging and solving for λ:

λ = 2 * (0.287 * sqrt(3) / sqrt(2)) * sin(34.35°) = 0.115171 nm (rounded to six decimal places).

Now, let's round off the wavelength to three decimal places:

λ = 0.115 nm.

So, the wavelength of X-rays in nm is:

[0.115].
