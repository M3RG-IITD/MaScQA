We know that the Maxwell's relations can be derived from the exact differentials of the thermodynamic potentials. One of the Maxwell's relation involves the partial derivatives of entropy, volume, and temperature. Looking at the given expression, we see that it involves the partial derivatives of Gibbs free energy, volume, and temperature. We can use the fact that G = H - TS, where H is enthalpy, to relate the given expression to the one involving entropy, volume, and temperature. 

Starting with the given expression: 

dG = VdP - SdT 

Using the definition of enthalpy: 

H = G + TS 

dH = dG + d(TS) 

dH = VdP - SdT + TdS + SdT 

dH = VdP + TdS 

Taking the partial derivative with respect to temperature at constant pressure and number of moles: 

(∂H/∂T)P,n = (∂/∂T)(VdP/T) = (1/T)(∂V/∂T)P,n + V/T(∂P/∂T)P,n 

Rearranging and substituting the Maxwell's relation (∂P/∂T)S,n = - (∂S/∂V)T,n: 

(∂S/∂V)T,n = (-∂/∂T)(VdP/T) = (-1/T²)(∂V/∂P)T,n 

Comparing this result to the answer choices, we see that the correct choice is:

(C) (𝜕𝑆/𝜕T)|$_(T,𝑛_𝑖)$ = -(𝜕V/𝜕P)|$_(T,𝑛_𝑖)$ 

since it involves the partial derivative of entropy with respect to temperature and the partial derivative of volume with respect to pressure, just like the Maxwell's relation we derived.
