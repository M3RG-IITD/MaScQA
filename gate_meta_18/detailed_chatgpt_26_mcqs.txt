First, let's find the molar free energy $G^{L}(T,x)$ for the alloy with $x=0.5$ and $T=1000K$ using the given equation:

$G^{L}(1000K,0.5) = (1-0.5)*[G_{(A)}]^{0,L} + 0.5*[G_{(B)}]^{0,L} + R*1000[0.5ln(0.5) + (1-0.5)ln(1-0.5)] + 4000*0.5*(1-0.5)$

Note that we can use the values of $[G_{(A)}]^{0,L}$ and $[G_{(B)}]^{0,L}$ to find $G^{L}(T,x)$ only if we know their actual values. However, since they are not given in the problem, we cannot calculate an exact value for $G^{L}(1000K,0.5)$. Therefore, we need to find the excess molar free energy $G^{XS,L}$ instead.

The excess molar free energy is defined as:

$G^{XS,L}(T,x) = G^{L}(T,x) - x*[G_{(B)}]^{0,L} - (1-x)*[G_{(A)}]^{0,L}$

We can use this equation to calculate $G^{XS,L}(1000K,0.5)$ with the values we have:

$G^{XS,L}(1000K,0.5) = G^{L}(1000K,0.5) - 0.5*[G_{(B)}]^{0,L} - 0.5*[G_{(A)}]^{0,L}$

$G^{XS,L}(1000K,0.5) = (1-0.5)*[G_{(A)}]^{0,L} + 0.5*[G_{(B)}]^{0,L} + R*1000[0.5ln(0.5) + (1-0.5)ln(1-0.5)] + 4000*0.5*(1-0.5) - 0.5*[G_{(B)}]^{0,L} - 0.5*[G_{(A)}]^{0,L}$

$G^{XS,L}(1000K,0.5) = R*1000[0.5ln(0.5) + (1-0.5)ln(1-0.5)] + 2000$

Simplifying the natural logarithmic terms and plugging in the value of the gas constant, we get:

$G^{XS,L}(1000K,0.5) = 8.314*1000[0.5*(-0.693) + 0.5*(-0.693)] + 2000$

$G^{XS,L}(1000K,0.5) = 8.314*(-1386.6) + 2000$

$G^{XS,L}(1000K,0.5) = -11533.684$

Therefore, the excess molar free energy $G^{XS,L}(1000K,0.5)$ for an alloy with $x=0.5$ at $T=1000K$ is approximately -11533.684 J $mol^{-1}$. 

The correct answer is (D) -5763 J $mol^{-1}$, which we find by considering that the excess molar free energy represents the energy required to form the alloy from the pure components, i.e., it is the difference in molar free energy between the alloy and an ideal mixture of the same components. Therefore, $G^{XS,L}(1000K,0.5)$ should be negative, and the correct answer is the closest option to -11533.684 J $mol^{-1}$, which is -5763 J $mol^{-1}$.
