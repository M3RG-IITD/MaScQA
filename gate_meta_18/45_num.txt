Assume Stokes law; i.e., drag force $𝐹_𝑑$ = 3𝜋𝜇𝐷𝑣, where 𝜇 is the viscosity of steel. Given: Density of liquid steel = 7900 kg $m^(-3)$ ; Viscosity of liquid steel = 0.0079 Pa s; Density of the inclusion = 2500 kg $m(-3)$ ; Acceleration due to gravity = 9.8 m $s^(-2)$. The terminal velocity(in mm$s^(-1)$ to two decimal places) (𝑣) of a spherical inclusion of diameter D = 50 micrometers rising in liquid steel is?
