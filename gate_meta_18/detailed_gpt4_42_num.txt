To determine the associated volume change in %, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the unit cells for both BCC and FCC structures.
2. Find the ratio of the volume of the FCC unit cell to the BCC unit cell.
3. Calculate the percentage change in volume.

Let's start with step 1:

1. Calculate the volume of the unit cells for both BCC and FCC structures:

For BCC, the lattice parameter is given as 0.293 nm. The volume of a BCC unit cell is given by the formula:

V_BCC = a_BCC^3

where a_BCC is the lattice parameter of the BCC phase.

V_BCC = (0.293 nm)^3 = 0.293^3 nm³ ≈ 0.0251 nm³

For FCC, the lattice parameter is given as 0.363 nm. The volume of an FCC unit cell is given by the formula:

V_FCC = a_FCC^3

where a_FCC is the lattice parameter of the FCC phase.

V_FCC = (0.363 nm)^3 = 0.363^3 nm³ ≈ 0.0479 nm³

Now, let's move to step 2:

2. Find the ratio of the volume of the FCC unit cell to the BCC unit cell.

R = V_FCC / V_BCC

R ≈ 0.0479 nm³ / 0.0251 nm³ ≈ 1.908

Finally, let's move to step 3:

3. Calculate the percentage change in volume.

Percentage change in volume = ((V_FCC - V_BCC) / V_BCC) * 100

Percentage change ≈ ((0.0479 nm³ - 0.0251 nm³) / 0.0251 nm³) * 100 ≈ (0.0228 nm³ / 0.0251 nm³) * 100 ≈ 0.908 * 100 ≈ 90.8 %

Rounding off to one decimal place, the associated volume change is 90.8%.

Therefore, the correct answer is [90.8].
