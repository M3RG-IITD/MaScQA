In order to solve this question, we need to analyze the relationship between the velocity and thermal boundary layers in terms of their governing parameters, which are the kinematic viscosity (ν) for the velocity boundary layer and the thermal diffusivity (α) for the thermal boundary layer.

Let's start by understanding the key parameter that relates the boundary layer thicknesses, which is the Reynolds number (Re) and Prandtl number (Pr).

The Reynolds number (Re) is defined as:
$$
Re = \frac{ρuL}{μ} = \frac{uL}{ν}
$$
Where ρ is the density, u is the flow velocity, L is the characteristic length, and μ is the dynamic viscosity.

The Prandtl number (Pr) is defined as:
$$
Pr = \frac{ν}{α}
$$
We know that the Prandtl number is significantly greater than 1 since the kinematic viscosity (ν) is significantly lower than the thermal diffusivity (α). 
Now, in order to obtain the relationship between the velocity boundary layer (δv) and the thermal boundary layer (δt), we need to consider two different cases: the case where the flow is steady and laminar and the case where the flow is not steady and/or turbid.

1) Steady and laminar flow: 

Since the flow is laminar, let's analyze the Blasius relations for the velocity and thermal boundary layers.

For the velocity boundary layer, we have:
$$
δ_v = \sqrt{\frac{νx}{u}}
$$
For the thermal boundary layer, we have:
$$
δ_t = \sqrt{\frac{αx}{u}}
$$
Let's divide δv by δt:
$$
\frac{δ_v}{δ_t} = \sqrt{\frac{ν}{α}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{Pr}}
$$
Since the Prandtl number (Pr) is significantly greater than 1, the term $$\sqrt{\frac{1}{Pr}}$$ will be less than 1, thus indicating that $δ_v < δ_t$. 

So the correct answer is: (A) $δ_v < δ_t$

The answer is: [A]
