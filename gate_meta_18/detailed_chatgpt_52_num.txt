The Bragg's law gives the relationship between the angle of diffraction (𝜃), the wavelength of X-rays (λ), and the lattice spacing (d) as follows:

2dsin𝜃 = nλ,

where n is an integer. 

For a BCC lattice, the first peak in the diffraction pattern corresponds to the (110) plane. The lattice spacing for this plane can be calculated using the following formula:

d = a/(√(h^2+k^2+l^2))

where a is the lattice parameter and h, k, and l are the Miller indices for the plane. 

For the (110) plane of BCC iron, h = 1, k = 1, and l = 0. Therefore,

d = a/(√(h^2+k^2+l^2))
d = 0.287/(√(1^2+1^2+0^2))
d = 0.1435 nm

Substituting the values of 𝜃 and d in the Bragg's law equation, we get:

2dsin𝜃 = nλ

2(0.1435)sin(68.7) = 1λ     (since n=1 for the first peak)

λ = 0.1541 nm

Therefore, the wavelength of X-rays in nm rounded off to three decimal places is:

0.154 nm
