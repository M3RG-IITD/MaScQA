The correct sequence of operations in an integrated steel plant is as follows:

1. Blast Furnace (BF) - The first step in the process is the production of pig iron. Iron ore, coke, and limestone are fed into the blast furnace, where the iron ore is reduced to pig iron by the carbon monoxide produced by the coke.

2. Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) - Next, the pig iron is refined into steel in the basic oxygen furnace. The pig iron is melted and then blown with oxygen, which removes impurities and creates the desired balance of carbon and other elements.

3. Ladle Furnace Process (LF) - After the BOF, the steel is transferred to a ladle and then to a ladle furnace. This is a secondary refining process that further removes impurities and adjusts the chemical composition of the steel.

4. Ruhrstahl Heraeus Degassing Process (RH) - Finally, the steel is transferred to a RH unit, which is a vacuum refining process that removes any remaining gases and impurities from the steel.

Therefore, the correct sequence is (B) BF→LF→BOF→RH.
