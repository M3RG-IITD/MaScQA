Let's assume that the temperature at the surface of the slab is constant and equal to T0. We can also assume that the thickness of the slab is small compared to the length of the slab, so we can assume 1-D heat transfer in the x-direction.

We can use Fourier's law of heat conduction to write:

q = -k1 * dT/dx  (for x < L1)

and

q = -k2 * dT/dx  (for x > L1)

where q is the heat flux (heat transfer per unit area per unit time), and dT/dx is the temperature gradient in the x-direction.

Since the temperature at the surface of the slab is T0, we can integrate the above equations to obtain:

T(x) - T0 = -q/k1 * x  (for x < L1)

T(x) - T0 = -q/k2 * (x-L1)  (for x > L1)

We know that T(L1) = T(L2) because the heat transfer rate should be the same at both locations to prevent shrinkage defects. Therefore, we can equate the above two equations at x=L1 to obtain:

-q/k1 * L1 = -q/k2 * (L2 - L1)

Simplifying, we get:

k1/k2 = L1/(L2 - L1) = 3/2

Therefore, the ratio of thermal conductivities $k_1$/$k_2$ is 3/2. 

Answer: [3/2]
