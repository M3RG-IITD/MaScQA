To match the metals in Group 1 with the appropriate extractive process in Group 2, we need to understand the basic principles behind each extractive process and which metals they are commonly used for.

Group I:
P. Fe (Iron)
Q. Ni (Nickel)
R. Al (Aluminum)
S. Cr (Chromium)

Group II:
1. Metallothermic Reduction
2. Carbothermic reduction
3. Matte Smelting
4. Fused Salt Electrolysis

Let's discuss each extractive process and see which metals they are typically used for.

1. Metallothermic Reduction: It is a process in which a metal oxide (or a halide) is reduced by another reducing agent (mostly a metal or metal hydride). The most common metal extracted through this process is Chromium (S).

2. Carbothermic reduction: In this process, a metal oxide is reduced by carbon (usually in the form of coke) to obtain the pure metal. The most common metal extracted through this process is Iron (P).

3. Matte Smelting: Matte smelting is a process in which sulfide ores are roasted to convert them to oxides, and then further processed to separate different metals from the compounds. This process is usually applied to extract metals from complex ore materials like copper, nickel (Q), and cobalt.

4. Fused Salt Electrolysis: In this process, the metal is extracted from its ore by passing an electric current through a molten (fused) salt of the metal. This method is most commonly used in the extraction of Aluminum (R) from its ore (bauxite).

Now, let's match the processes to the metals:

P. Fe (Iron) – 2. Carbothermic Reduction
Q. Ni (Nickel) – 3. Matte Smelting
R. Al (Aluminum) – 4. Fused Salt Electrolysis
S. Cr (Chromium) – 1. Metallothermic Reduction

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(C) P-2, Q-3, R-4, S-1
