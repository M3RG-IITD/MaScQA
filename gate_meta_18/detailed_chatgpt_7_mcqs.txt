To solve this question, we need to understand the concept of upset forging and the effect of friction on the axial compressive stress. 

Upset forging is a process in which a cylindrical workpiece is compressed along its length to increase its diameter and reduce its length. During this process, the workpiece is subjected to a compressive stress along its length, which is called the axial compressive stress. 

Friction plays an important role in upset forging because it resists the movement between the workpiece and the dies used to compress it. This resistance results in an additional compressive stress on the workpiece, called the frictional compressive stress. 

Now let's analyze the given profiles:

Profile P: It shows a constant value of compressive stress, which does not change with time. This cannot be the axial compressive stress because it should increase as the workpiece is being compressed. 

Profile Q: It shows a gradually increasing compressive stress, which reaches a maximum value at the end of the forging process. This could represent the axial compressive stress because it increases with time and reaches a maximum value at the end. However, we need to consider the effect of friction on the stress profile as well. 

Profile R: It shows an increasing compressive stress that reaches a peak value and then decreases rapidly. This cannot represent the axial compressive stress because it decreases after reaching the maximum value, which is not expected for the axial compressive stress. 

Profile S: It shows a compressive stress that oscillates between positive and negative values. This cannot represent the axial compressive stress because it should always be a positive value during the forging process. 

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) Q
