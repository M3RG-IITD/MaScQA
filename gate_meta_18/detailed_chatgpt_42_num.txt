The volume change can be calculated by first finding the volumes of the unit cells for both crystal structures and then comparing them.

For the BCC crystal structure, the volume of the unit cell can be calculated as:
V_BCC = a^3 * (4/3 * pi * r^3) / (4 * sqrt(3))
where a is the lattice parameter and r is the atomic radius of iron.

The atomic radius of iron can be found in a periodic table or reference book and is approximately 0.124 nm.

Thus, substituting the values we get:
V_BCC = (0.293 nm)^3 * (4/3 * pi * (0.124 nm)^3) / (4 * sqrt(3))
V_BCC = 0.0269 nm^3

For the FCC crystal structure, the volume of the unit cell can be calculated as:
V_FCC = a^3 / 4
where a is the lattice parameter of the FCC crystal structure.

Thus, substituting the values we get:
V_FCC = (0.363 nm)^3 / 4
V_FCC = 0.0150 nm^3

The change in volume can now be calculated as:
deltaV = V_FCC - V_BCC
deltaV = 0.0150 nm^3 - 0.0269 nm^3
deltaV = -0.0119 nm^3

The negative volume change indicates that the FCC crystal structure has a smaller volume than the BCC crystal structure.

The percentage change in volume can be calculated as:
deltaV_percent = (deltaV / V_BCC) * 100
deltaV_percent = (-0.0119 nm^3 / 0.0269 nm^3) * 100
deltaV_percent = -44.2%

Thus, the associated volume change is -44.2%, which means that the FCC crystal structure of iron has a 44.2% smaller volume than the BCC crystal structure. 

Answer:
-44.2%
