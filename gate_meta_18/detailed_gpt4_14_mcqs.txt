BOF (Basic Oxygen Furnace) steel-making process is an important method for the production of steel, where pig iron is refined in a furnace by blowing oxygen on it to remove carbon and other impurities.

During this process, a slag layer is produced as a byproduct. This layer protects the refractory lining of the furnace from impurities & erosive effect of the molten metal, and it should be as stable as possible to minimize the refractory loss.

Now let's analyze the given options:

A) $Al_2O_3$ - Alumina typical has high melting point and low solubility in slag, it means that it helps in reducing overall solubility in the slag, resulting in better refractory lining protection.

B) $Fe_2O_3$ - Iron oxide or ferric oxide is a fluxing agent and present in relatively higher amounts in the slag. It's not desirable to supersaturate slag with iron oxide, as it will not add stability to the refractory lining.

C) $SiO_2$ - Silica is also present in the slag, but it is not used to supersaturate the slag, as it can also act as a fluxing agent and may not help to increase the stability of the refractory lining.

D) MgO - Magnesium oxide can react with the slag to form a more stable compound (magnesiow√ºstite) and increase its viscosity, which in turn helps to protect the refractory lining. Additional MgO also contributes to a higher melting point of the slag, which can enhance the refractory lining's durability.

Conclusion:
To minimize refractory loss during BOF steel-making, slag is supersaturated with MgO (option D), as it helps to increase the stability of refractory lining, reduce impurities solubility, and enhance slag melting point.
