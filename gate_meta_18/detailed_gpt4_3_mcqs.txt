To find the number of dimensionless variables needed to describe the system, we are going to use Buckingham's Pi Theorem. 

First, let's find the total number of variables in the system. We have 5 variables with the following physical dimensions: 

1. Pressure [P] = M^1 L^(-1) T^(-2)
2. Velocity [V] = L^1 T^(-1)
3. Size [L] = L^1
4. Density [D] = M^1 L^(-3)
5. Viscosity [Î¼] = M^1 L^(-1) T^(-1)

There are 3 fundamental dimensions in this system: mass (M), length (L), and time (T).

Next, calculate the number of dimensionless variables using the formula:

Number of dimensionless variables = Total number of variables - Number of fundamental dimensions

Insert the values:

Number of dimensionless variables = 5 - 3

Number of dimensionless variables = 2

So, the answer is A) 2.
