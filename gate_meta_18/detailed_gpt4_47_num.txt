To find the saturation magnetization of Fe, we first need to calculate the number of atoms per unit cell in the BCC structure and then find the volume of the unit cell. 

Step 1: Calculate the number of atoms per unit cell in BCC structure
In a Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) structure, there are 2 atoms per unit cell. One atom is located at each corner of the cube, and the other atom is located in the center of the cube. Since there are 8 corners in a cube and each corner atom is shared by 8 unit cells, there is 1/8 of an atom contribution from the corner atoms.

Therefore, the number of atoms per unit cell in BCC structure is:
Number of corner atoms + Number of central atoms
= (8 corners × 1/8 atoms per corner) + 1 central atom
= 1 + 1
= 2 atoms per unit cell

Step 2: Calculate the volume of the unit cell
Given the lattice parameter (a) for BCC iron is 0.287 nm. We need to convert it to meters first by multiplying with $10^{-9}$:
a = 0.287 nm × $10^{-9}$ m/nm = 0.287 × $10^{-9}$ m 

The volume of a cube is given by V = a^3. Therefore, the volume of the unit cell in BCC iron is:
V = (0.287 × $10^{-9}$ m)^3 = 2.37 × $10^{-29}$ m$^3$

Step 3: Calculate the saturation magnetization
The saturation magnetization (M_s) is defined as the total magnetic moment per unit volume. The net magnetic moment of an Fe atom is given as 2 𝜇𝐵. 

Total magnetic moment of one unit cell = Number of atoms per unit cell × Magnetic moment per atom
= 2 atoms × 2 𝜇𝐵 = 4 𝜇𝐵

Now we'll convert 𝜇𝐵 to A m$^2$ using the given value of 𝜇𝐵 = 9.273 × $10^{-24}$ A m$^2$:

Total magnetic moment of one unit cell = 4 𝜇𝐵 × 9.273 × $10^{-24}$ A m$^2$ = 3.709 × $10^{-23}$ A m$^2$

Now, we can find the saturation magnetization as:

M_s = (Total magnetic moment of one unit cell) / (Volume of unit cell)
= (3.709 × $10^{-23}$ A m$^2$) / (2.37 × $10^{-29}$ m$^3$) = 1.566 × $10^6$ A m$^{-1}$

Since we need the answer in kA m$^{-1}$, we'll divide the result by 10$^3$:

M_s = 1.566 × $10^6$ A m$^{-1}$ / 10$^3$ = 1566 kA m$^{-1}$

Rounded off to one decimal place, the saturation magnetization of Fe in kA m$^{-1}$ is:

M_s ≈ 1566.0 kA m$^{-1}$

So, the correct answer is [1566.0].
