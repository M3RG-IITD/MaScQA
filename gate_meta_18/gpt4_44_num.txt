To find the width of the fusion zone, we need to find the distance x (in mm) from the weld center where the temperature T equals the melting point, i.e., 1500 K. So let's first set the given equation equal to 1500 and solve for x.

1500 = 2000 * exp(-0.3*x^2)

Now, let's solve for x:
Divide both sides by 2000:

0.75 = exp(-0.3*x^2)

Take the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(0.75) = -0.3*x^2

Divide both sides by -0.3:

x^2 = ln(0.75) / (-0.3)

Now, take the square root of both sides:

x = sqrt(ln(0.75) / -0.3)

x ≈ 0.918

Since the distance x can be in both directions from the weld center, the width of the fusion zone is 2x:

Width = 2 * x ≈ 2 * 0.918 ≈ 1.84 mm

So, the width of the fusion zone is approximately 1.84 mm.

Answer: [1.84]
