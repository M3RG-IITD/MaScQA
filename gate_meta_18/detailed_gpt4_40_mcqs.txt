To solve this problem, we'll first need to understand the relationship between stress, strain, and bulk modulus. Bulk modulus (K) is a measure of a material's resistance to compression and is defined as the ratio of stress (σ) to volumetric strain (Δ). Mathematically, it is represented by the following formula:

K = σ/Δ

In this problem, we're given the volumetric strain (Δ) as 3.5 × 10^(-4). We're not given the stress. However, we need to find the bulk modulus (K). 

Since the problem doesn't provide us with any information about the stress state itself (i.e., we don't know the stresses imposed in different directions), we cannot directly calculate the stress (σ). 

In this case, since we have multiple choices for the bulk modulus (K), we can use the given volumetric strain (Δ) to determine which choice is reasonable. 

The possible values of bulk modulus are:
(A) 150 GPa
(B) 350 GPa
(C) 200 GPa
(D) 400 GPa

We'll now multiply each of these choices by the given volumetric strain (Δ) to check if any stress value makes sense (physically reasonable) for a given material. 

Stress (σ) = Bulk modulus (K) * Volumetric strain (Δ)

(A) σ = 150 * 3.5 × 10^(-4) = 0.0525
(B) σ = 350 * 3.5 × 10^(-4) = 0.1225
(C) σ = 200 * 3.5 × 10^(-4) = 0.07
(D) σ = 400 * 3.5 × 10^(-4) = 0.14

All of the resulting stress values are relatively small and seem physically reasonable for a material. Nevertheless, there is no information in the problem on stress or other stress-state related values to confirm whether these stress values make sense in the context of the problem.

The problem might be missing some information, and without further details, it is impossible to determine the correct answer from the given choices. Therefore, the correct answer is:

[None of the above]
