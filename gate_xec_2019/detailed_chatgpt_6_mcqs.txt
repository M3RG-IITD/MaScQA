To calculate the atomic percent of carbon in iron, we need to find the atomic weight of carbon and the atomic weight of iron. 

Given: 

Atomic weight of carbon = 12 

Atomic weight of iron = 56 

Percentage by weight of carbon in iron = 6% 

To find the atomic percent of carbon in iron: 

Step 1: Find the weight of carbon in iron. 

If the percentage by weight of carbon in iron is 6%, then the weight of carbon in 100g of iron is: 

Weight of carbon = 6g 

Step 2: Find the number of moles of carbon and iron. 

To find the number of moles, we need to divide the weight by the atomic weight. 

Number of moles of carbon = 6g / 12 g/mol = 0.5 moles 

Number of moles of iron = 100g / 56 g/mol = 1.79 moles 

Step 3: Find the atomic percent of carbon in iron. 

The atomic percent of carbon in iron is the number of moles of carbon divided by the total number of moles (carbon + iron) multiplied by 100. 

Atomic percent of carbon in iron = (0.5 / (0.5 + 1.79)) x 100 = 22.4% 

Therefore, the answer is option (B) 23 (rounded to the nearest whole number).
