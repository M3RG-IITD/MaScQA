To find the equilibrium distance between the atom pair, we need to find the minimum value of potential energy, such that dU/dr = 0. 

Let's differentiate U with respect to r:
dU/dr = 3A/$r^4$ - 7B/$r^8$

Setting it equal to 0:
3A/$r^4$ = 7B/$r^8$

Simplifying and solving for r:
r^4 = 7B/3A
r = (7B/3A)^(1/4)

Substituting the given values of A and B:
r = ((7 * 2.1 * $10^(-22)$) / (3 * 6 * $10^(-20)$))^(1/4)
r = 0.2563547488 nm

Rounding off to 2 decimal places:
r = 0.26 nm

Therefore, the equilibrium distance between the atom pair is 0.26 nm. 

Answer: 
- 0.26 nm
