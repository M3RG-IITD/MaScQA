Let's break down the problem into steps.

Step 1: We are given the relationship between tensile true stress (𝜎) and true strain (𝜀) as:
𝜎 (MPa) = 600 $𝜀^𝑛$

Step 2: We are given the values of true stress and true strain when 𝜀 = 0.05 as:
True stress, 𝜎 = 350 MPa
True strain, 𝜀 = 0.05

Step 3: We can use these values to determine the value of n:
350 = 600 * (0.05)^n

Step 4: Solve for n:
n = log(350/600) / log(0.05)
n ≈ 0.359

Now that we have the value of n, let's find the engineering stress when the engineering strain is 0.12.

Step 5: Convert engineering strain (0.12) to true strain:
True strain, 𝜀 = ln(1 + engineering strain)
𝜀 = ln(1 + 0.12) ≈ 0.113

Step 6: Calculate the true stress associated with this true strain using the relationship we found earlier:
𝜎 (MPa) = 600 * (0.113)^0.359
True stress, 𝜎 ≈ 366.84 MPa

Step 7: Convert true stress to engineering stress:
Engineering stress = True stress / (1 + engineering strain)
Engineering stress = 366.84 / (1 + 0.12) ≈ 327.18 MPa

Step 8: Round off the answer to the nearest integer:
Engineering stress = 327 MPa

So, the engineering stress when the engineering strain is 0.12 is 327 MPa.
