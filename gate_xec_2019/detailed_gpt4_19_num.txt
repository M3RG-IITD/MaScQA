To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Find the energy gained by the electron (in joules) from the accelerating voltage.
Step 2: Find the momentum of the electron using the energy-momentum relationship.
Step 3: Calculate the de Broglie wavelength λ using the de Broglie equation.

Step 1: 
Energy gained by the electron E = accelerating voltage * electron charge
E = 300 kV * 1.6 * $10^{-19}$ C

Since 1 kV = 1000 V, we have:
E = 300,000 V * 1.6 * $10^{-19}$ C = 4.8 * $10^{-14}$ J

Step 2:
We can get the momentum p of the electron using the energy-momentum relationship:

E = (1/2) * m * v^2

Where E is the energy gained by the electron, m is the electron rest mass, and v is the velocity of the electron.

We can solve for v:

v^2 = 2 * E / m
v = sqrt(2 * E / m)

Now we can find the momentum p:

p = m * v
p = m * sqrt(2 * E / m)

Substitute the values for m and E:

p = (9.11 * $10^{-31}$ kg) * sqrt(2 * 4.8 * $10^{-14}$ J / (9.11 * $10^{-31}$ kg))

p ≈ 3.14 * $10^{-23}$ kg m/s

Step 3:
Now we can use the de Broglie equation to find the wavelength λ:

λ = h / p

Where h is Planck's constant (6.63 * $10^{-34}$ J s) and p is the momentum of the electron.

Substitute the value of h and p:

λ = (6.63 * $10^{-34}$ J s) / (3.14 * $10^{-23}$ kg m/s)

λ ≈ 2.11 * $10^{-11}$ m

Now we can convert the wavelength to the form x * $10^{-12}$ m:

2.11 * $10^{-11}$ m = x * $10^{-12}$ m

x ≈ 21.10

Since we need to round off to 2 decimal places, we have x = 21.10.

So, the de Broglie wavelength of the electron is 21.10 * $10^{-12}$ m.

The correct answer is [21.10].
