To demagnetize an iron bar magnet, we need to apply a magnetic field (H) opposite to its magnetization. The coercivity of the magnet is the magnetic field required to reduce its magnetization to zero. In this case, the coercivity is given as 7000 A/m.

Now, let's find the magnetic field (H) inside the solenoid necessary to demagnetize the bar magnet. The magnetic field inside a solenoid is given by the formula:

H = (n * I)

where n is the number of turns per unit length of the solenoid, and I is the current passing through the solenoid.

First, let's find the number of turns per unit length (n) for the given solenoid:

n = Number of turns / Length of solenoid
n = 150 turns / 0.25 m
n = 600 turns/m

Now we have the coercivity (H) required for demagnetizing the bar magnet, and the turns per unit length (n) for the solenoid. We can use these values to calculate the current (I) needed to generate the necessary magnetic field.

From the formula H = n * I, we can find I:

I = H / n
I = 7000 A/m / 600 turns/m
I = 11.6666... A

Rounding off to 1 decimal place, we get:

I â‰ˆ 11.7 A

So, a current of approximately 11.7 amperes is required to generate the necessary magnetic field to demagnetize the iron bar magnet.

The answer is: [11.7]
