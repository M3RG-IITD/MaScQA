To find the equilibrium distance, we need to find the distance at which the potential energy is at a minimum. To do this, we can take the derivative of U(r) with respect to r, set it equal to zero, and solve for r.

dU(r)/dr = 3A/$r^4$ - 7B/$r^8$

Setting this to zero gives:

3A/$r^4$ = 7B/$r^8$

Simplifying:

$r^4$ = (7B/3A)

$r$ = ($7B/3A)^{1/4}$

Substituting A and B:

$r$ = ($7(2.1*10^{-22})/(3(6*10^{-20}))^{1/4}$ = 0.285 nm

Therefore, the equilibrium distance is 0.29 nm (rounded to 2 decimal places).

Answer: [0.29 nm]
