Let's break this down step by step.

1. First, we determine the probability of drawing a white ball from Box-S and transferring it to Box-T:

There are 2 white balls and 4 black balls in Box-S, for a total of 6 balls. So the probability of picking a white ball from Box-S is 2/6, which can be simplified to 1/3.

2. Next, we find the probability of drawing a white ball from Box-T after a white ball from Box-S has been transferred:

If a white ball is transferred to Box-T, the number of white balls in Box-T will increase to 6, and the total number of balls will be 9 (5 white + 3 black + 1 transferred white ball). So the probability of drawing a white ball from Box-T in this case is 6/9, which can be simplified to 2/3.

3. Now, we determine the probability of drawing a black ball from Box-S:

There are 4 black balls in Box-S and a total of 6 balls. The probability of picking a black ball from Box-S is 4/6, which can be simplified to 2/3.

4. We then find the probability of drawing a white ball from Box-T after a black ball from Box-S has been transferred:

If a black ball is transferred to Box-T, the number of black balls in Box-T will increase to 4, and the total number of balls will be 9 (5 white + 3 black + 1 transferred black ball). So the probability of drawing a white ball from Box-T in this case is 5/9.

5. Lastly, we compute the overall probability of drawing a white ball from Box-T after a random ball is transferred from Box-S:

The overall probability is the sum of the probabilities of drawing a white ball from Box-T after a white ball is transferred and after a black ball is transferred, weighted by the probabilities of transferring a white or black ball from Box-S:

Overall probability = (Probability of transferring a white ball from Box-S) * (Probability of drawing a white ball from Box-T after a white ball is transferred) + (Probability of transferring a black ball from Box-S) * (Probability of drawing a white ball from Box-T after a black ball is transferred)

Overall probability = (1/3) * (2/3) + (2/3) * (5/9)

To compute this, first we'll calculate each product:

(1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9
(2/3) * (5/9) = 10/27

Now, we'll sum these two products:

2/9 + 10/27 = 6/27 + 10/27 = 16/27

The overall probability of drawing a white ball from Box-T after a random ball is transferred from Box-S is 16/27, which can be expressed as a decimal and rounded off to 2 decimal places:

16/27 â‰ˆ 0.59

So, the final answer is:

[0.59]
