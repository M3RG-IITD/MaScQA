To find the zero-point energy of an electron in a box, we will use the formula for the energy of a particle in a one-dimensional box:

$E_n = \frac{n^2h^2}{8mL^2}$

Where $E_n$ is the energy of the electron at level n, h is Planck's constant, m is the mass of the electron, and L is the length of the box.

Given values:
- Planck's constant, h = 6.63 × $10^{-34}$ J s
- 1 eV = 1.6 × $10^{-19}$ J
- Electron mass, m = 9.11 × $10^{-31}$ kg
- Box width (length), L = 0.2 nm = 0.2 × $10^{-9}$ m (converting nanometers to meters)

For the zero-point energy, we need to find the energy at the n = 1 level:

$E_1 = \frac{1^2h^2}{8mL^2}$

$E_1 = \frac{(6.63 × 10^{-34} J s)^2}{8(9.11 × 10^{-31} kg)(0.2 × 10^{-9} m)^2}$

Now, perform the calculations inside the bracket first:

$E_1 = \frac{6.63^2 × 10^{-68} J^2 s^2}{8 × 9.11 × 10^{-31} kg × 0.04 × 10^{-18} m^2}$

$E_1 ≈ \frac{43.92 × 10^{-68} J^2 s^2}{2.92 × 10^{-48} kg m^2}$

Now, divide the numbers:

$E_1 ≈ \frac{43.92}{2.92} × 10^{-20} J$

$E_1 ≈ 15.04 × 10^{-20} J$

Now, we need to convert this energy from Joules to electron volts (eV) using the given conversion factor of 1 eV = 1.6 × $10^{-19}$ J:

$E_1 ≈ \frac{15.04 × 10^{-20} J}{1.6 × 10^{-19} J/eV}$

$E_1 ≈ 9.4$ eV (rounded off to 1 decimal place)

Hence, the zero-point energy of an electron in a box of 0.2 nm width is approximately 9.4 eV.
