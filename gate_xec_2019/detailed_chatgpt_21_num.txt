We know that the relation between stress, electric field, and polarization for a piezoelectric material is given by:

$\sigma = e_{ij}E_j + d_{ij}T_{ij}$

Here, $\sigma$ is the stress, $e_{ij}$ is the piezoelectric coefficient, $E_j$ is the electric field, $d_{ij}$ is the dielectric constant, and $T_{ij}$ is the strain tensor.

For this problem, we are given the Young's modulus of the material, which is related to the piezoelectric coefficient and the dielectric constant as follows:

$e_{ij} = \frac{d_{ij}}{\epsilon_{ij}} = \frac{d_{ij}}{\epsilon_0 \epsilon_r}$

Here, $\epsilon_{ij}$ is the permittivity tensor, $\epsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity, and $\epsilon_r$ is the relative permittivity.

We are also given the change in polarization $\Delta P$ from 640 to 645 C m $m^{-3}$, which is related to the strain tensor as follows:

$\Delta P = d_{ij} T_{ij}$

We want to find the stress $\sigma$ required to induce this change in polarization. To do this, we need to first find the value of the strain tensor $T_{ij}$.

We know that the strain tensor is related to the stress tensor as follows:

$T_{ij} = \frac{1}{2G}(\sigma_{ij} - \nu \sigma_{kk} \delta_{ij})$

Here, $\sigma_{ij}$ is the stress tensor, $G$ is the shear modulus, $\nu$ is Poisson's ratio, and $\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta.

Using the definition of Young's modulus $E = \frac{2G(1+\nu)}{1-2\nu}$, we can solve for the shear modulus as:

$G = \frac{E}{2(1+\nu)}$

Substituting this into the equation for the strain tensor, we get:

$T_{ij} = \frac{1}{E}(\sigma_{ij} - \frac{\nu}{1-\nu}\sigma_{kk}\delta_{ij})$

Since we are only interested in the stress required to induce a change in polarization, we can simplify this expression further by assuming that the stress is uniaxial (i.e., $\sigma_{ij} = \sigma \delta_{ij}$). This gives us:

$T_{ij} = \frac{1}{E}(\sigma - \frac{\nu}{1-\nu}\sigma\delta_{ij})$

$T_{ij} = \frac{\sigma}{E}(1 - \frac{\nu}{1-\nu}\delta_{ij})$

Now we can use the relation between the change in polarization and the strain tensor to solve for the strain tensor:

$\Delta P = d_{ij}T_{ij} = d_{33}T_{33}$

$T_{33} = \frac{\Delta P}{d_{33}}$

Substituting this into the expression for the strain tensor, we get:

$T_{33} = \frac{\sigma}{E}(1 - \frac{\nu}{1-\nu})$

$\frac{\sigma}{E} = \frac{T_{33}}{1 - \frac{\nu}{1-\nu}}$

$\frac{\sigma}{E} = \frac{T_{33}(1-\nu)}{2}$

$\sigma = \frac{2E}{1-\nu}T_{33}$

Now we can substitute the given values into this expression to get the stress required to induce the change in polarization:

$E = 72 \text{ GPa} = 72 \times 10^9 \text{ Pa}$

$\Delta P = 5 \text{ C m }m^{-3}$

$d_{33} = 11 \text{ pC/N}$

$\nu = 0.33$

$\sigma = \frac{2\times 72 \times 10^9}{1-0.33}\frac{5 \times 10^{-12}}{11 \times 10^{-12}} \approx 5.05 \text{ MPa}$

Rounding off to the nearest integer, we get the final answer:

Answer: [5] 5 MPa
