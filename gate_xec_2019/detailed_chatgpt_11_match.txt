P: Solid state sintering involves heating the compacted powder particles in the solid state. It requires a high temperature to sinter the particles by atomic diffusion. This process is used to produce ceramics, refractories, and metal powders.

Q: Liquid phase sintering involves adding a small amount of a lower melting point material to the powder mixtures. During sintering, the low melting material melts and facilitates the bonding between the particles. It is used for the production of tungsten carbide, diamond tools, and high-speed steel.

R: Spark plasma sintering is an advanced sintering technique that applies high electric current and pressure to sinter the powders. It is a fast process that produces homogenized dense materials. It is used for the production of advanced ceramics, composites, and nanostructured materials.

S: Laser sintering is an additive manufacturing process that uses a laser beam to fuse the powder particles to form a solid object. It is used for the production of metal, ceramic, and polymer 3D printed parts.

According to the above processes and their applications, the correct match is: 

(C) P-3; Q-2; R-4; S-1
P-3: Iron powder products are produced using solid-state sintering.
Q-2: A mixture of Cu and Zn powder products are produced using liquid phase sintering.
R-4: 3D printed products are produced using spark plasma sintering.
S-1: Carbon nanotube products are produced using laser sintering.
