The polymer is subjected to creep, which is the phenomenon of deformation under constant load or stress over time. From the given data, we can assume that the polymer is under constant strain since the stress drops to 16.6 MPa after 100 hours. 

To find the expected life of the assembly, we can use the concept of creep rupture. Creep rupture is the failure of a material due to exposure to a constant load or stress over time. The time to failure can be estimated using the Larson-Miller parameter (LMP) as follows:

LMP = (T + 273) * log(t + c)

where T is the temperature in Celsius, t is the time to failure in hours, and c is a material constant.

Since the temperature is not given in the question, we can assume it to be room temperature, which is around 25Â°C. The material constant for the polymer can also be assumed to be 20.

Using the given stress values, we can calculate the creep rate (C) of the polymer as follows:

C = (16.6 - 17) / (17 * 100) = -0.001

Substituting the values in the LMP equation and solving for t, we get:

LMP = (25 + 273) * log(t + 20) = -2.303 / 0.001

t + 20 = e^(-2.303 / 0.001 * 298) = 15630.5

t = 15610.5 hours

However, we need to ensure that the stress on the polymer remains above 14.5 MPa during this time period. To check this, we can use the Norton-Bailey power law, which describes the relationship between the creep rate and stress as follows:

C = A * sigma^n

where A and n are material constants, and sigma is the applied stress.

Rearranging, we get:

sigma = (C / A)^(1/n)

From the given stress values, we can calculate the value of A as follows:

A = C / sigma^n = -0.001 / 17^1 = -0.001

Substituting the values in the Norton-Bailey equation, we get:

sigma = (-0.001 / -0.001)^(1/1.1) = 13.6 MPa

Since the stress on the polymer remains above 14.5 MPa during the expected life of the assembly, it can function properly for this time period.

Therefore, the expected life of the assembly is approximately 15610 hours.
