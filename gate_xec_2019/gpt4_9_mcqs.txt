We know that the energy gap of Germanium (Ge) is given: Eg = 0.67 eV.

To find the maximum wavelength of radiation, we can use the relation between energy and wavelength: Eg = (hc) / λ

First, we need to convert the energy gap from eV to Joules: Eg in Joules = 0.67 eV * 1.6 * 10^(-19) J/eV = 1.072 * 10^(-19) J.

Now we can rearrange the formula to find λ:

λ = (hc) / Eg

Substitute the given values of h, c, and Eg:

λ = (6.63 * 10^(-34) J s * 3 * 10^(8) ms^(-1)) / (1.072 * 10^(-19) J)

λ = 1.86 * 10^(-6) m

To convert this to micrometers, we multiply by 10^6:

λ = 1.86 * 10^(-6) m * 10^6 = 1.86 μm.

Now, looking at the given options, we can see that option (B) 1.8 μm is the closest to our calculated value. So, the correct answer is:
