(Given: Diffusion coefficients of copper in aluminium at 400 째C and 500 째C are 5*$10^(-14)m^(2)s^(-1)$ and 6*$10^(-13)m^(2)s^(-1)$, respectively). Copper is diffused into aluminium at 400 째C for 100 hours to obtain a certain concentration at a given depth. In another experiment conducted at 500 째C, to achieve the same concentration of copper at the same depth, the time required in hours is
(A) 7.33 (B) 8.33 (C) 9.33 (D) 10.33
