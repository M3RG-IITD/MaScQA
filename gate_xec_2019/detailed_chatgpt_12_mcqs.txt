Zone refining is a process used to purify a material by passing a molten zone along it. The impurities in the material usually have different solubilities in the liquid and solid phases and will either be dragged along with the molten zone or remain static. The answer to the question can be found by considering which condition would hinder the separation of these impurities.

(A) Increase in the gap between solidus and liquidus lines: This refers to the temperature range over which the material transitions from solid to liquid. A larger gap would mean a wider temperature range over which impurities could dissolve in the material, making it more difficult to separate them. Therefore, this condition would NOT favor the separation of impurities.

(B) Increase in the solubility of impurities in solid as compared to that in the liquid phase: This condition would have the opposite effect of (A) and would make it easier to separate impurities by ensuring that they remain in the liquid phase and are not dragged along with the molten zone. Therefore, this condition would favor the separation of impurities.

(C) Agitation of melt: Agitation of the melt would help to disperse impurities evenly throughout the material, making their separation more difficult. Therefore, this condition would NOT favor the separation of impurities.

(D) Low cooling rate of melt: A low cooling rate would allow for better separation of impurities by providing more time for them to either dissolve in the molten zone or to remain static. Therefore, this condition would favor the separation of impurities.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Increase in the gap between solidus and liquidus lines.
