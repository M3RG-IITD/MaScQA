To determine which deformation is time-independent, let's define each type of deformation:

(A) Elastic deformation: Elastic deformation is reversible and instantaneous deformation that occurs when stress is applied to a material. When the stress is removed, the material returns to its original shape. Hooke's Law governs the behavior of elastic materials. Elastic deformation is time-independent since the material deforms and recovers instantly with the application and removal of stress.

(B) Anelastic deformation: Anelastic deformation is a time-dependent deformation process that involves recovery over time. The material is unable to return to its original shape immediately upon removal of stress, instead, it takes a certain amount of time to reach its original shape. Anelastic deformation can be viewed as a combination of elastic and inelastic behaviors, and it is time-dependent.

(C) Viscoelastic deformation: Viscoelastic deformation involves both elastic and viscous characteristics, which means it exhibits both time-independent and time-dependent behaviors. When stress is applied to a viscoelastic material, it deforms due to both its elastic and viscous properties. When the stress is removed, the material partially recovers instantly (elastic behavior) and partially recovers over time (viscous behavior). Viscoelastic deformation is time-dependent.

(D) Creep deformation: Creep deformation is a slow, time-dependent deformation that occurs when a material is subjected to constant stress for an extended period. Creep deformation is a result of long-term exposure to high levels of stress that are still below the material's yield strength. Creep deformation is time-dependent since the deformation rate depends on the duration of the applied stress.

Now let's compare:

Elastic deformation (A) is time-independent because it is instantaneous, and the material recovers as soon as the stress is removed.
Anelastic deformation (B), viscoelastic deformation (C), and creep deformation (D) are time-dependent since they involve processes that occur over time and are affected by the duration of applied stress.

So the correct answer is:
