We need to find the zero point energy of an electron in a box. This is a problem of a particle in a one-dimensional box which can be described by the following formula for energy levels:

E_n = (n^2 * h^2) / (8 * m * L^2)

Where E_n is the energy of the nth level, h is Planck's constant, m is the mass of the electron, and L is the width of the box. For the zero point energy, we have:

E_1 = (h^2) / (8 * m * L^2)

The zero point energy is the energy of the lowest possible state (n=1) allowed by quantum mechanics.

Given parameters:
h = 6.63 * 10^(-34) J s (Planck's constant)
m = 9.11 * 10^(-31) kg (electron mass)
L = 0.2 nm = 0.2 * 10^(-9) m (width of the box)

Now, we plug these values into the formula to find the zero point energy:

E_1 = ( (6.63 * 10^(-34))^2 ) / (8 * (9.11 * 10^(-31)) * (0.2 * 10^(-9))^2 )
E_1 = 6.24631095 * 10^(-17) J

Now, we need to convert this energy from Joules to electron volts (eV). We are given that 1 eV = 1.6 * 10^(-19) J. So, we can convert E_1 to eV by dividing by the conversion factor:

E_1_ev = E_1 / (1.6 * 10^(-19))
E_1_ev = (6.24631095 * 10^(-17) J) / (1.6 * 10^(-19) J/eV)
E_1_ev â‰ˆ 390.394434 eV

Rounding off to 1 decimal place, the zero point energy of an electron in a box of 0.2 nm width is approximately 390.4 eV.
