Let's use the formula for exponential decay: 

y = a * (1 - r)^t

Where y is the stress after time t, a is the initial stress, r is the decay rate, and t is the time in hours. 

We know the initial stress is 17 MPa. After 100 hours, the stress is 16.6 MPa. Let's solve for the decay rate r:

16.6 = 17 * (1 - r)^100

Divide both sides by 17:

0.9765 = (1 - r)^100

Take the 100th root of both sides:

(0.9765)^(1/100) = 1 - r

Solve for r:

r = 1 - (0.9765)^(1/100)
r ≈ 0.000234

Now we can use this decay rate to find how long it takes for the stress to drop to 14.5 MPa. 

14.5 = 17 * (1 - 0.000234)^t

Divide both sides by 17:

0.8529 = (1 - 0.000234)^t

Take the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(0.8529) = t * ln(1 - 0.000234)

Now, divide by ln(1 - 0.000234) to solve for t:

t = ln(0.8529) / ln(1 - 0.000234)
t ≈ 1187.35

Since we need to round off to the nearest integer, the expected life of the assembly is approximately 1187 hours.

Answer: [1187].
