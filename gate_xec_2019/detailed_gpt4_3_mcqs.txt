We are given a NaCl crystal, and we are replacing a Na⁺ ion with a Ca²⁺ ion. Let's analyze each of the given options to see the most probable outcome of this substitution.

(A) The formation of a Na⁺ vacancy.
If we replace a Na⁺ ion with a Ca²⁺ ion, we are introducing one extra positive charge in the crystal. Thus, to maintain charge neutrality and not create an imbalance, a Na⁺ vacancy might be formed. Remember this possibility.

(B) The creation of a Cl⁻ interstitial.
Interstitial means that an ion occupies a space between the usual lattice points for that ion. Since we are replacing a Na⁺ ion with a Ca²⁺ ion, it is not probable that a Cl⁻ ion would be "pushed" into an interstitial position because of this change. This option is unlikely.

(C) The formation of a Cl⁻ vacancy.
Replacing a Na⁺ ion with a Ca²⁺ ion would not affect the existing Cl⁻ ions in the lattice structure. Since we have an additional positive charge instead of a negative one, the formation of a Cl⁻ vacancy would create an imbalance of charges. This option is not probable.

(D) The formation of a Na⁺ and Cl⁻ vacancy pair.
A combination of Na⁺ and Cl⁻ vacancies would retain the charge neutrality of the lattice structure. However, as previously stated, replacing a Na⁺ ion with a Ca²⁺ ion should not affect the Cl⁻ ions, so the formation of a Cl⁻ vacancy is very unlikely, ruling out this option. 

Returning to option (A), since we introduce an extra positive charge in the coordination environment, it is the most plausible possibility to form a Na⁺ vacancy to maintain the charge balance. Therefore, the correct choice is:
