Given data: 
- Tensile true stress – true strain curve for plastic region of an alloy is given by 𝜎 (MPa)=600 $𝜀^𝑛$
- At true strain 𝜀 = 0.05, the true stress is 350 MPa

Using the first equation, we can find the value of n as follows:
350 MPa = 600 (0.05)$^{n}$
n = (log(350/600))/(log(0.05)) = -1.2089

Now using the relationship between true and engineering strains, we can find the value of true strain (𝜀) corresponding to the given engineering strain (𝜀$_{eng}$ = 0.12):
𝜀 = ln(1 + 𝜀$_{eng}$) = ln(1 + 0.12) = 0.1143

Using the first equation again, we can find the true stress (𝜎) corresponding to this true strain value:
𝜎 = 600 𝜀$^n$ = 600 (0.1143)$^{-1.2089}$ = 844.8 MPa

Therefore, the engineering stress at an engineering strain of 0.12 for this alloy is approximately 845 MPa (rounded off to nearest integer).

Answer: [845]
