We know that zero point energy is given by 

$E = \frac{h^2}{8mL^2}$

where $h$ is the Planck's constant, $m$ is the mass of the particle and $L$ is the width of the box.

Converting the width of the box from nm to m:

$L = 0.2 \ nm = 0.2 \times 10^{-9} \ m$

Substituting the values in the above equation for an electron, we get:

$E = \frac{(6.63 \times 10^{-34})^2}{8 \times (9.11 \times 10^{-31}) \times (0.2 \times 10^{-9})^2}$

Solving this expression, we get:

$E = 3.3 \times 10^{-2} \ J$

Converting from joules to electron volts (eV):

$1\ J = \frac{1}{1.6 \times 10^{-19}} \ eV$

$3.3 \times 10^{-2} \ J = 3.3 \times 10^{-2} \times \frac{1}{1.6 \times 10^{-19}} \ eV$

$E = 2.06 \ eV$ (rounded off to $1$ decimal place)

Therefore, the zero point energy of an electron in a box of 0.2 nm width is 2.1 eV.
