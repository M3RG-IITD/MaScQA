Given: Number-averaged molecular weight (Mn) = $10^5gmol^{-1}$
Degree of polymerization (DP) = 2210
Repeat unit of Ethylene = $-CH_{2}-CH_{2}-$

To find the other repeat unit, we need to find the molecular weight of the repeat units in the copolymer.

Molecular weight of copolymer per repeat unit (MW) = Mn / DP
MW = $10^5 / 2210$
MW = 45.25 g/mol

We are given the atomic weights of H = 1, C = 12, F = 19, and Cl = 35.5. Let's find the molecular weight of each given option:

(A) $-CH_{2}-CH(CH_3)-$
Molecular weight = (2 * 12) + (5 * 1) =  24 + 5 = 29

(B) $-CH_{2}-CHCl-$
Molecular weight = (2 * 12) + (2 * 1) + 35.5 = 24 + 2 + 35.5 = 61.5

(C) $-CF_{2}-CF_{2}-$
Molecular weight = (2 * 12) + (4 * 19) = 24 + 76 = 100

(D) $-CH_{2}-CH(C_{6}H_{5})-$
Molecular weight = (7 * 12) + (7 * 1) = 84 + 7 = 91

By comparing the molecular weights of the given options with our calculated MW for copolymer per repeat unit (45.25 g/mol), we find option (B) $−CH_2−CHCl−$ has the closest molecular weight.

So, the other repeat unit is $−CH_2−CHCl−$.
