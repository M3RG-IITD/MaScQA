There are two cases to consider: either a white ball or a black ball is moved from Box-S to Box-T. 

Case 1: A white ball is moved from Box-S to Box-T. 
The probability of selecting a white ball from Box-S is 2/6 = 1/3. 
After moving a white ball to Box-T, there will be 3 white balls and 3 black balls in Box-S and 6 white balls and 4 black balls in Box-T. 
The probability of selecting a white ball from Box-T now is 6/10 = 3/5. 
Therefore, the probability of selecting a white ball from Box-T given that a white ball was moved from Box-S to Box-T is (1/3) * (3/5) = 1/5 = 0.20. 

Case 2: A black ball is moved from Box-S to Box-T. 
The probability of selecting a black ball from Box-S is 4/6 = 2/3. 
After moving a black ball to Box-T, there will be 5 white balls and 4 black balls in Box-S and 5 white balls and 4 black balls in Box-T. 
The probability of selecting a white ball from Box-T now is 5/9. 
Therefore, the probability of selecting a white ball from Box-T given that a black ball was moved from Box-S to Box-T is (2/3) * (5/9) = 10/27 = 0.37 (rounded to 2 decimal places). 

To find the overall probability, we need to calculate the probability of each case and add them together: 

Probability of moving a white ball * probability of selecting a white ball from Box-T given a white ball was moved + 
Probability of moving a black ball * probability of selecting a white ball from Box-T given a black ball was moved 

= (1/3)*(3/5) + (2/3)*(5/9) 
= 0.20 + 0.37 
= 0.57 

Therefore, the overall probability of selecting a white ball from Box-T is 0.57 (rounded to 2 decimal places). 

Answer: [0.57]
