To find the atomic percent of carbon in iron, we'll first need to determine how many moles of carbon and iron are present in some sample weight. Then, we'll divide the moles of carbon by the total moles of both elements to find the atomic percent.

Let's assume we have a 100 g sample. This choice is convenient because the given percentage (6%) can be considered as grams directly.

1. Calculate the weight of carbon and iron in the sample:

Carbon weight: 6% of 100 grams = 6 grams
Iron weight: 94% of 100 grams = 94 grams

2. Calculate the moles of carbon and iron:

Moles of carbon = weight / atomic weight
Moles of carbon = 6 g / 12 g/mole = 0.5 moles

Moles of iron = weight / atomic weight
Moles of iron = 94 g / 56 g/mole ≈ 1.68 moles

3. Calculate the total moles:

Total moles = moles of carbon + moles of iron
Total moles ≈ 0.5 + 1.68  ≈ 2.18 moles

4. Calculate the atomic percent of carbon:

Atomic percent of carbon = (moles of carbon / total moles) × 100
Atomic percent of carbon ≈ (0.5 / 2.18) × 100 ≈ 22.94%

Rounded to the nearest whole number, the atomic percent of carbon in iron is approximately 23%. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 23. Answer: [23].
