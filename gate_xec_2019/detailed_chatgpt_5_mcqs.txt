We can use Fick's Second Law of Diffusion to solve this problem.

Fick's Second Law of Diffusion states: 

$$\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} = D\frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial x^2}$$

where $C$ is the concentration of the diffusing species, $t$ is time, $x$ is distance, and $D$ is the diffusion coefficient.

We can rearrange this equation to solve for the time required at 500 °C:

$$\frac{t_{500}}{t_{400}} = \frac{(D_{500})}{(D_{400})}\left(\frac{T_{400}}{T_{500}}\right)^2$$

where $t_{500}$ is the time required at 500 °C, $t_{400}$ is the time required at 400 °C, $D_{500}$ is the diffusion coefficient at 500 °C, $D_{400}$ is the diffusion coefficient at 400 °C, $T_{400}$ is the temperature at 400 °C, and $T_{500}$ is the temperature at 500 °C.

We can plug in the given values:

$$\frac{t_{500}}{100 \text{ hours}} = \frac{(6 \times 10^{-13}m^2s^{-1})}{(5 \times 10^{-14}m^2s^{-1})}\left(\frac{400 \text{ K}}{500 \text{ K}}\right)^2$$

Simplifying this expression gives:

$$t_{500} = \frac{(6 \times 10^{-13}m^2s^{-1})}{(5 \times 10^{-14}m^2s^{-1})}\left(\frac{400 \text{ K}}{500 \text{ K}}\right)^2(100 \text{ hours}) \approx 8.33 \text{ hours}$$

Therefore, the answer is (B) 8.33.
