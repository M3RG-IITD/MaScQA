We are given the following information:

Young's modulus (E) = 72 GPa = 72 x 10^3 MPa
ΔPolarization (ΔP) = 645 C/m³ - 640 C/m³ = 5 C/m³

We want to find the stress required to cause this change in polarization. To do this, we first need to understand the relationship between stress, strain, and polarization in piezoelectric materials.

In general, stress (σ) is related to strain (ε) through Young's modulus (E) as follows:

σ = E × ε

In piezoelectric materials, the polarization (P) is also related to the strain (ε) through the piezoelectric coefficient (d). This relationship is given by:

ΔP = d × ε

To find the stress required to cause the given change in polarization, we can eliminate the strain from these equations.

First, we'll write the equation for the strain in terms of the polarization and piezoelectric coefficient:

ε = ΔP / d

Now, substitute this expression for the strain in the stress-strain equation:

σ = E × (ΔP / d)

We need to find the value of d for the given piezoelectric material. Unfortunately, the information provided in the problem statement is insufficient to determine d. Typically, the piezoelectric coefficient is a property specific to the material being used and can be found in experimental or manufacturer's data.

Assuming we have the value of d, we can calculate the stress required to change the polarization:

σ = E × (ΔP / d)

However, we cannot proceed further without the value of d, so we don't have the answer.
