The overall corrosion reaction for nickel can be written as follows:  

Ni(s) $\rightarrow$ Ni$^{2+}$(aq) + 2e$^{-}$
 
The standard reduction potential for the above reaction is given as -0.25 V. The standard electromotive force (emf) of this reaction will be 

$\Delta G°=-nFE°_{cell}$ 

where, $n$ = number of electrons transferred = 2 

$F$ = Faraday’s constant = 96500 C $mol^(−1)$ 

$E°_{cell}$ = standard reduction potential = -0.25 V 

Later, $K_{eq}$ can be calculated by using the formula: 

$\Delta G°=-RT \ln K_{eq}$

where, 

$R$ = Universal gas constant = 8.314 J $K^(−1)mol^(−1)$ 

$T$ = Temperature = 298 K 

Substituting the given values, we can calculate the equilibrium constant, $K_{eq}$. 

$K_{eq}$ = $\exp(-\frac{\Delta G°}{RT})$ 

The value of equilibrium constant $K_{eq}$ thus obtained can be used to calculate the concentration of nickel ions $(Ni^{2+})$ and hence the partial pressure of hydrogen which is required to stop the corrosion of nickel. 

The concentration of $Ni^{2+}$ at equilibrium is given by the expression, 

$[Ni^{2+}]= \frac{K_{eq}.[H^+]^2}{[HCl]}$

where [HCl] = 0.06 M (as nickel chloride is assumed to be completely dissociated)

Assuming that the partial pressure of hydrogen used here is directly proportional to $H^+$ and considering the pH of the solution, 

$H^+$ = 10$^{-4}$ M 

Substituting the above values, we get, 

$[Ni^{2+}]$ = $\frac{\exp(-\frac{\Delta G°}{RT}).(10^{-4})^2}{0.06}$ 

$[Ni^{2+}]$ = 5.93 × 10$^{-14}$ M 

The number of moles of nickel that will have to be converted to its ion, $Ni^{2+}$, in order to react with the given hydrogen is 2 to balance the equation. Hence, the number of moles of nickel that will be protected by one mole of hydrogen will be 0.5. 

So, the required moles of hydrogen will be equal to the number of moles of nickel ions $(Ni^{2+})$ at equilibrium. 

$n(H_2)$ = 0.5 × $[Ni^{2+}]$ 

$n(H_2)$ = 2.965 × 10$^{-15}$ 

Now, using the ideal gas law, PV = nRT, we can calculate the partial pressure $(P)$ of hydrogen. 

$P$ = $\frac{n(H_2)RT}{V}$ 

Here, V is the volume of the solution, for which let us assume 1 liter. 

Substituting the values, we get, 

$P$ = $\frac{(2.965×10^{-15})(8.314)(298)}{1}$ 

$P$ = $6.22×10^{-14}$ atm 

Rounding it off to the nearest integer, we get the final answer as: 

[Answer]: 0 atm
