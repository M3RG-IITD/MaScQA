To find the de Broglie wavelength (λ) of an electron, we can use the formula:

λ = h / p

where h is the Planck's constant, and p is the momentum of the electron. Since we are given the potential that the electron is accelerated across, we can first calculate the electron's kinetic energy (KE) and then find its momentum.

KE = qV
p = √(2m(KE))

where q is the electron charge, V is the potential, and m is the electron mass.

Now, we plug in the given values:

KE = (1.6 * 10^(-19) C)(300 * 10^3 V) = 4.8 * 10^(-14) J

p = √(2 * (9.11 * 10^(-31) kg) * (4.8 * 10^(-14) J)) ≈ 3.913 * 10^(-23) kg m/s

Now, we can find the de Broglie wavelength:

λ = (6.63 * 10^(-34) J s) / (3.913 * 10^(-23) kg m/s) ≈ 1.694 * 10^(-11) m

Converting it to the given format:

x = 1.694 * 10^(-11) m * (10^12) = 16.94

Rounding off to 2 decimal places, x is approximately 16.94.

So, the de Broglie wavelength is 16.94 * 10^(-12) m, and the answer is [16.94].
