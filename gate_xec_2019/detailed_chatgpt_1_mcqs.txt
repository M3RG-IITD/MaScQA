The correct answer is:

(D) the astigmatism increases.

Here's the detailed explanation:

Objective aperture is a crucial part of an optical microscope that controls the amount of light entering the lens system. By adjusting the objective aperture size, we can control the resolution, depth of field, and contrast of the microscope image. Here's how decreasing the objective aperture size affects these parameters:

(A) The spherical aberration increases: Spherical aberration occurs when the rays passing through the center of the lens focus at a different point than the rays passing through the edges. This distortion increases with the aperture size, so reducing the aperture size can reduce the spherical aberration. However, if the aperture is too small, the wavefront of light passing through it becomes uneven, increasing the spherical aberration.

(B) The depth of field increases: Depth of field is the area in the specimen that appears in focus at the same time. Decreasing the aperture size increases the depth of field, which means more parts of the specimen appear in focus simultaneously.

(C) The diffraction-limited resolution increases: According to the Rayleigh criterion, the resolution of a microscope is directly proportional to the wavelength of light used and inversely proportional to the numerical aperture of the lens system. A smaller aperture means a larger numerical aperture, resulting in a higher resolution.

(D) The astigmatism increases: Astigmatism occurs when the rays passing through the vertical and horizontal meridians of the lens focus at different points. Decreasing the aperture size changes the position of the diffraction disk, making the vertical and horizontal meridians of the lens focus at different points and increasing the astigmatism.

Therefore, the correct option is (D) the astigmatism increases.
