The de Broglie wavelength can be calculated using the formula:

λ = h / p

where λ is the de Broglie wavelength, h is Planck's constant, and p is momentum.

To find the momentum of the electron, we first need to find its kinetic energy:

K.E. = qV
where q is the charge of the electron and V is the potential difference.

Substituting the given values, we get:

K.E. = (1.6 × $10^(-19)$ C) × (300 × 10^3 V)
    = 4.8 × $10^(-14)$ J

The momentum of the electron can be calculated using:

p = sqrt(2mK.E.)

where m is the mass of the electron.

Substituting the given values, we get:

p = sqrt(2 × 9.11×$10^(-31)$ kg × 4.8 × $10^(-14)$ J)
  = 1.275 × $10^(-23)$ kg m/s

Substituting the values of h and p in the formula for de Broglie wavelength, we get:

λ = h / p
  = (6.63 × $10^(-34)$ J s) / (1.275 × $10^(-23)$ kg m/s)
  = 5.20 × $10^(-12)$ m

Therefore, x = 5.20 (rounded off to 2 decimal places).

Answer: [5.20]
