The coercivity of a magnet is the measure of the ability of the magnetic material to withstand an external magnetic field without getting demagnetized. In this problem, we are given the coercivity of an iron bar magnet and we need to calculate the electric current required to demagnetize it.

Let us first calculate the magnetic field required to demagnetize the bar magnet. According to the definition of coercivity, the magnetic field required to demagnetize a material is equal to the coercivity of the material. Therefore, the magnetic field required to demagnetize the iron bar magnet in this problem is 7000 A $m^{-1}$.

Next, let us calculate the magnetic field generated by the solenoid when a current is passed through it. The magnetic field inside a solenoid is given by the equation:

$B = \mu_0 \cdot n \cdot I$

Where:
- B is the magnetic field in Tesla
- $\mu_0$ is the vacuum permeability constant, which has a value of $4 \pi \times 10^{-7}$ T $m$ $A^{-1}$
- n is the number of turns per unit length
- I is the electric current in amperes

In this problem, the solenoid has a length of 0.25 m and 150 turns of wire. Therefore, the number of turns per unit length is:

$n = \frac{150}{0.25} = 600$

Substituting the values into the equation for the magnetic field, we get:

$B = \mu_0 \cdot n \cdot I = 4 \pi \times 10^{-7} \cdot 600 \cdot I = 2.4 \times 10^{-4} \cdot I$

Now, we need to equate the magnetic field generated by the solenoid to the magnetic field required to demagnetize the iron bar magnet, and solve for I. Therefore, we have:

$B_{solenoid} = B_{iron\ bar\ magnet}$

$2.4 \times 10^{-4} \cdot I = 7000$

$I = \frac{7000}{2.4 \times 10^{-4}} = 29,166.7 \approx \boxed{29.2}$ amperes

Therefore, the electric current required to generate the necessary magnetic field is approximately 29.2 amperes.
