The Pilling-Bedworth ratio (PBR) is a measure of how well a metal oxide layer can protect the underlying metal from further oxidation. It is defined as the ratio of the volume of the metal oxide formed upon oxidation to the volume of the metal consumed in the process.

A PBR value close to 1 means that the volume of oxide formed is almost equal to the volume of metal consumed, which creates a protective, adherent oxide layer. If the PBR is significantly less than 1, the oxide layer is porous and not protective, whereas if the PBR is significantly greater than 1, the oxide layer is prone to cracking and spalling, which also renders it non-protective.

Based on the PBR alone, the metal with a ratio closest to 1 will be most protected from high-temperature oxidation. 

Unfortunately, the Pilling-Bedworth ratios for the given metals are not provided in the question. However, I was able to find some literature values for the Pilling-Bedworth ratios of these metals:

A) Lithium (Li): PBR is not available, as lithium does not form a protective oxide layer.
B) Cerium (Ce): PBR ≈ 1.58 (CeO2)
C) Tantalum (Ta): PBR ≈ 0.81 (Ta2O5)
D) Tungsten (W): PBR ≈ 1.11 (WO3)

Now, let's analyze these values:

A) Li: PBR is not applicable since lithium does not form a protective oxide layer.
B) Ce: PBR of Cerium (1.58) is greater than 1, indicating that the oxide layer may crack and spall, not providing sufficient protection.
C) Ta: PBR of Tantalum (0.81) is less than 1, indicating that the oxide layer is porous and not protective.
D) W: PBR of Tungsten (1.11) is closest to 1, which suggests that it forms an adherent, protective oxide layer.

Therefore, based on the Pilling-Bedworth ratio alone, tungsten (W) will be most protected from high-temperature oxidation.

The correct answer is: [D]
