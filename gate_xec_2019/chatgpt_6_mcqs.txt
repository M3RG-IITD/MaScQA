First, we need to find the atomic weight of iron containing carbon. To do so, we can use the following equation:

Atomic weight of iron containing carbon = (atomic weight of carbon × percentage of carbon) + (atomic weight of iron × percentage of iron)

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

Atomic weight of iron containing carbon = (12 × 6) + (56 × 94) = 10640

Next, we can calculate the atomic percent of carbon in the iron using the following formula:

Atomic percent of carbon = [(atomic weight of carbon × percentage of carbon) / atomic weight of iron containing carbon] × 100

Substituting the values, we get:

Atomic percent of carbon = [(12 × 6) / 10640] × 100 = 0.067 %

Rounding off to the nearest whole number, we get approximately 0.1 %. Thus, the answer is not given in the options provided.
