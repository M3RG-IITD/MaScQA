The de Broglie wavelength is given by the equation:

$\lambda = \frac{h}{p}$

where h is Planck's constant and p is the momentum of the particle.

To find the momentum of the electron, we use the classical formula for the kinetic energy:

$K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$

where m is the mass of the electron and v is its velocity.

The potential energy of the electron is given by:

$U = qV$

where q is the electron charge and V is the accelerating voltage.

The total energy of the electron is the sum of its kinetic and potential energies:

$E = K + U$

Since the electron is accelerated from rest, its initial kinetic energy is zero. Therefore, we have:

$E = U = qV$

Substituting in the values given in the question, we get:

$E = (1.6 * 10^{-19})(300 * 10^3) = 4.8 * 10^{-14}$ J

The momentum of the electron can be found by equating its energy to the relativistic expression for kinetic energy:

$E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$

where c is the speed of light and m is the rest mass of the electron.

Since we are instructed to ignore relativistic effects, we can use the non-relativistic formula:

$K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$

Setting this equal to the electron's kinetic energy, we get:

$\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = qV$

Solving for v, we get:

$v = \sqrt{\frac{2qV}{m}}$

Substituting in the values given in the question, we get:

$v = \sqrt{\frac{2(1.6 * 10^{-19})(300 * 10^3)}{9.11 * 10^{-31}}} = 1.35 * 10^7$ m/s

The momentum of the electron is:

$p = mv = (9.11 * 10^{-31})(1.35 * 10^7) = 1.23 * 10^{-23}$ kg m/s

Finally, we can find the de Broglie wavelength using the equation:

$\lambda = \frac{h}{p}$

Substituting in the values we have calculated, we get:

$\lambda = \frac{6.63 * 10^{-34}}{1.23 * 10^{-23}} = 0.054$ nm

Rounding off to 2 decimal places, the answer is:

x = 0.05

Therefore, the correct answer is:
- 0.05
