We can use the formula for energy of a photon: $E = hc/\lambda$, where $E$ is the energy of the photon, $h$ is Planck's constant, $c$ is the velocity of light, and $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the photon.

For Germanium to be opaque, the energy of the photon must be greater than or equal to the energy gap of Germanium, which is 0.67 eV.

We can convert this energy to Joules using the conversion factor given: 0.67 eV * 1.6*$10^(-19)$ J/eV = 1.072*$10^(-19)$ J.

We can then rearrange the formula for energy of a photon to solve for the maximum wavelength:

$\lambda_{max} = hc/E_{min}$

$\lambda_{max} = (6.63 * 10^(-34) J s) * (3 * 10^(8) m/s) / (1.072*10^(-19) J)$

$\lambda_{max} = 1.85 * 10^(-6) m = \boxed{\text{(B) 1.8 }\mu\text{m}}$

Therefore, the maximum wavelength of radiation to which Germanium is opaque is 1.8 Î¼m.
