The correct answer is:

(C) P-2, Q-4, R-1, S-5

Explanation:

- Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) uses a sharp tip to scan the surface of a material and measures the tunneling current that flows between the tip and the surface. It provides sub-Angstrom resolution, so option 5 matches with STM. Therefore, option (A) and option (D) can be eliminated.
- Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) uses a beam of electrons to scan the surface of a material and detects the backscattered electrons. Therefore, option 2 matches with SEM.
- Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) transmits electrons through a thin sample and detects the transmitted electrons to form an image. Therefore, option 1 matches with TEM.
- Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measures the forces between a sharp tip and the surface of a material. The tip is mounted on a cantilever, and the deflection of the cantilever is used to map the surface topography. Therefore, option 4 matches with AFM.

Using these explanations, we can see that option (C) is the correct match of characterization techniques in Column I with the options in Column II.
