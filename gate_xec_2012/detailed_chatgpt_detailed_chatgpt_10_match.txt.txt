The given question is testing the understanding of the units of different physical properties. We are given four properties, thermal diffusivity, fracture toughness, surface energy, and magnetic permeability, and five units, Hm-1, m2s-1, Fm-1, Nm-3/2, and Jm-2. We need to correctly match each property with its corresponding unit.

Let's first understand the meaning of each property:

1. Thermal diffusivity is a measure of how quickly heat can pass through a material.

2. Fracture toughness is the ability of a material containing a crack to resist fracture.

3. Surface energy is the energy required to increase the surface area of a material.

4. Magnetic permeability is the ability of a material to conduct magnetic flux.

Now, let's match each property with its correct unit:

1. Thermal diffusivity should be measured in m2s-1 as it is a measure of the rate of heat transfer in a material per unit time per unit area.

2. Fracture toughness should be measured in Nm-3/2 as it is related to the energy required to propagate a crack.

3. Surface energy should be measured in Jm-2 as it is the energy required to increase the surface area of a material.

4. Magnetic permeability should be measured in Hm-1 as it is the ratio of magnetic flux density to magnetic field strength.

Therefore, the correct match of properties with their units is (A) P-2, Q-5, R-4, S-1.

Final answer: (A) P-2, Q-5, R-4, S-1.
