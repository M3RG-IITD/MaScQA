The bcc structure has two atoms in a unit cell. The diagonal of the unit cell can be calculated using Pythagoras theorem as:
$$
\sqrt{3}a=4r
$$
where $a$ is the lattice parameter and $r$ is the atomic radius. 

Thus, the lattice parameter can be calculated as:
$$
a=\frac{4r}{\sqrt{3}}=\frac{4\times 1.247}{\sqrt{3}}=2.88\ \text{Å}
$$
where we have used the fact that the atomic diameter is $2r=2.494$ Å.

Therefore, the answer is (B) 2.880 Å. 

Answer: 
(B) 2.880 Å.
