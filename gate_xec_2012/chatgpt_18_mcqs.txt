The composition of the initial austenite and the final phases are given as follows:

- Initial austenite: 0.8 wt.% C
- Final phases:
  - Ferrite (α): 0.02 wt.% C
  - Cementite ($Fe_3C$): 6.67 wt.% C

To find the volume % of pearlite, we first need to find the fractions of ferrite and cementite present in the final microstructure. For this, we can use lever rule:

$$
\frac{f - f_\alpha}{f_{Fe_3C} - f_\alpha} = \frac{C - C_\alpha}{C_{Fe_3C} - C_\alpha}
$$

where $f$ is the fraction of cementite in the microstructure, $f_\alpha$ is the fraction of ferrite, $C$ is the carbon content of the initial austenite, $C_{Fe_3C}$ and $C_\alpha$ are the carbon contents of cementite and ferrite, respectively, at the given temperature.

At 723°C (just below the eutectoid temperature), the phase diagram for the given steel shows that $C_{Fe_3C} = 0.77$ wt.% C and $C_\alpha = 0.022$ wt.% C. Therefore, we have:

$$
\frac{f - 0.02}{0.77 - 0.02} = \frac{0.8 - 0.022}{0.77 - 0.022}
$$

Simplifying this equation gives: $f = 0.469$ or 46.9% (approx.)

Since pearlite is a two-phase mixture of ferrite and cementite, its volume % can be related to their fractions by:

$$
V_{pearlite} = 2 f_{Fe_3C} = 2 \times 0.469 = 0.938 = 93.8\%
$$

Therefore, the answer is (not in the given choices): 93.8%.
