The Pilling-Bedworth ratio is an important concept in the study of corrosion, particularly for understanding the formation of oxide layers on metals. This ratio helps us to determine whether the oxide layer formed on the metal surface will be protective, causing the corrosion to slow down, or non-protective, causing the corrosion to continue.

To answer this question, let's break down each option:

(A) Volume of oxide to volume of metal
(B) Weight of oxide to weight of metal
(C) Density of oxide to density of metal
(D) Surface area of oxide to surface area of metal

The Pilling-Bedworth ratio is actually defined as the ratio of the volume of oxide formed to the volume of metal it would have consumed to form that oxide. This ratio can be represented using the following formula:

Pilling-Bedworth Ratio (PB) = (Volume of oxide) / (Volume of metal)

So, the correct answer is:

(A) Volume of oxide to volume of metal

Answer: [(A)]
