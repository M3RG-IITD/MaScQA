Thermal diffusivity - this property relates to the ability of a material to conduct heat across its thickness. Hence its unit would be [Length2/Time].

Fracture toughness - this property is a measure of a material's resistance to cracking when subjected to stress. Hence its unit would be [Force/length^3/2] or [Work/Force] or [Length].

Surface energy - this property is the energy required to increase the surface area of a material by a unit amount. Hence its unit would be [Energy/length^2] or [Force/length] or [Charge Length].

Magnetic permeability - this property is the measure of the ability of a material to conduct magnetic flux. Hence its unit would be [Inductance/length] or [Force/Current^2] or [Force (charge* time) / (length*current)^2].
