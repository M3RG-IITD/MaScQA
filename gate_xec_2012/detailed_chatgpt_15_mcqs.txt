Given: 

Electron concentration (n) = 5 * $10^{18}$ $m^{-3}$

Drift velocity of electrons (v) = 100 $m/s$

Electric field (E) = 500 $V/m$

Formula Used: 

The formula used to calculate the conductivity of the semiconductor is:

$$\sigma = ne\mu$$

where $\sigma$ is the conductivity of the semiconductor, $n$ is the electron concentration, $e$ is the charge of an electron, and $\mu$ is the electron mobility.

We can calculate the electron mobility using the following formula:

$$\mu = \frac{v}{E}$$

where $\mu$ is the electron mobility, $v$ is the drift velocity of electrons, and $E$ is the electric field.

Calculation:

Charge of an electron (e) = 1.6 * $10^{-19}$ $C$

Electron mobility ($\mu$) = $\frac{v}{E}$ = $\frac{100}{500}$ = 0.2 $m^2/Vs$

Substituting the values of $n$, $e$, and $\mu$ in the formula of conductivity, we get:

$$\sigma = ne\mu = 5*10^{18}*1.6*10^{-19}*0.2 = 0.16*10^1 S/m$$

Therefore, the conductivity of the semiconductor is 0.16*10^(â€“1) S/m, which is answer choice (A). 

Answer: 

(A) 0.16 * $10^{-1}$ S/m
