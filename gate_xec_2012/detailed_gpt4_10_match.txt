To match the properties in Column I with the appropriate units in Column II, we need to know the units for each property. Let's analyze each property:

P. Thermal diffusivity:
Thermal diffusivity has a unit of m²/s (length²/time). This represents how fast heat diffuses through a material. The unit for this property is m²s⁻¹, which matches with 2 in Column II.

Q. Fracture toughness:
Fracture toughness represents a material's resistance to crack propagation. It is measured in terms of stress intensity, and its unit is Nm^(-3/2) (stress intensity factor). This corresponds to 4 in Column II.

R. Surface energy:
Surface energy is the excess energy at the surface of a material compared to the bulk. Its unit is J/m² (energy/area), which corresponds to 5 in Column II.

S. Magnetic permeability:
Magnetic permeability measures the ability of a material to support the formation of a magnetic field within itself. The unit for magnetic permeability is H/m (henry/meter), which matches with 1 in Column II.

Now, we can match the properties with the units:

P. Thermal diffusivity = 2 (m²s⁻¹)
Q. Fracture toughness = 4 (Nm⁻³/₂)
R. Surface energy = 5 (Jm⁻²)
S. Magnetic permeability = 1 (Hm⁻¹)

So the correct matching is given in Option (B): P-2, Q-4, R-5, S-1.
