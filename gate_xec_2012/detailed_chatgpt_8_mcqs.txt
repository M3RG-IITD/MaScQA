X-ray diffraction is a technique that is used to study the crystal structure and defects in materials. It can also be used to measure the microstrain in materials. Microstrain is a small amount of strain that is present in a material due to the presence of defects, impurities, or stresses.

Microstrain can be measured by X-ray diffraction using the peak broadening and position. This is because microstrain causes the crystal lattice to be distorted, which results in a shift in the position of the diffraction peak and a broadening of the peak.

The broadening of the peak indicates the degree of microstrain in the crystal lattice. The position shift of the peak corresponds to the angular distortion of the crystal lattice.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(D) Position and broadening
