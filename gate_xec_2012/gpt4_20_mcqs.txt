To calculate the final area of the steel bar after the deformation under the applied load, we can use the formula for volumetric dilation, which is a combination of linear deformation and Poisson's ratio.

1. First, we need to find the axial stress applied to the steel bar.
Axial stress (σ) = Axial load (P) / Cross-sectional area (A)

σ = 20000 N / 8 cm² (converting kN to N)
σ = 2500 N/cm²

2. Now, we can calculate axial strain (ε) using Hooke's Law.
Axial strain (ε) = Axial stress (σ) / Young's modulus of steel (E_steel)

ε = 2500 N/cm² / 200 GPa (converting GPa to N/cm²)
ε = 2500 N/cm² / 200 × 10⁷ N/cm²

ε = 1.25 × 10⁻⁵

3. Next, obtain the lateral strain (ε_lat) from Poisson's ratio (ν) and axial strain (ε).
Lateral strain (ε_lat) = -Poisson's ratio (ν) × Axial strain (ε)

ε_lat = -0.3 × 1.25 × 10⁻⁵
ε_lat = -3.75 × 10⁻⁶

4. Finally, calculate the final cross-sectional area (A_final) by applying the lateral strain to the initial area.
A_final = A_initial × (1 + ε_lat)

A_final = 8 cm² × (1 - 3.75 × 10⁻⁶)
A_final ≈ 8 cm² × (1 - 0.00000375)

A_final ≈ 7.97 cm²

Since the answer is close to 7.9 cm², the correct option is:

(A) 7.9 cm²
