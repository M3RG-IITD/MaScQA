The Pilling-Bedworth ratio measures the volume change that occurs when a metal reacts with oxygen to form an oxide. It is defined as the ratio of the volume of the oxide to the volume of the metal consumed in the reaction.

Mathematically, the Pilling-Bedworth ratio can be represented as:

PBR = V(oxide) / V(metal)

where PBR is the Pilling-Bedworth ratio, V(oxide) is the volume of oxide formed, and V(metal) is the volume of the metal consumed.

The correct answer is (A) Volume of oxide to volume of metal.
