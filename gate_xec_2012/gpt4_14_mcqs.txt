To solve this problem, we need to find the mole fraction of vinyl chloride in the copolymer. We can do this by first finding the molecular weight of a monomer unit of vinyl chloride and vinyl acetate.

Molecular weight of vinyl chloride (VC) = 12(C) + 1(H) * 2 + 35.5(Cl) = 62.5 g/mol
Molecular weight of vinyl acetate (VA) = 12(C) * 4 + 1(H) * 6 + 16(O) * 2 = 86 g/mol

Next, we know the degree of polymerization (n) of the copolymer, which is 160.

Let's assume that x moles of vinyl chloride (VC) and y moles of vinyl acetate (VA) are present in the copolymer.
So, x + y = n

Now we need to consider the molecular weight of the copolymer.
Molecular weight = (VC moles * VC molecular weight) + (VA moles * VA molecular weight)
10520 g/mol = (x * 62.5) + (y * 86)

Since x + y = 160, we can say y = 160 - x
Substituting the value of y in the molecular weight equation, we get:
10520 = (x * 62.5) + ((160 - x) * 86)

Solving for x:
10520 = 62.5x + 13760 - 86x
23.5x = 3240
x = 137.87

The mole fraction of vinyl chloride in the copolymer is then x/n:
Mole fraction of VC = 137.87/160
Mole fraction of VC = 0.862

So, the correct answer would be (D) 0.86. Answer: [(D)].
