To calculate the final area of the steel bar, we need to find the amount of elongation and contraction as a result of the applied 20 kN tensile load. 

1. Let's find the stress acting on the steel bar because of the tensile load.

Stress ($σ$) = Force ($F$) / Area ($A$)

Given:
Force, $F$ = 20 kN = 20,000 N (converting kN to N)
Area, $A$ = 8 cm² = 0.0008 m² (converting cm² to m²)

So, Stress ($σ$) = $(20,000 N) / (0.0008 m²)$ = $25,000,000 N/m²$ or $25,000,000 Pa$.

2. Now let's calculate the strain ($ε$) using Young's modulus ($E_s$) for steel.

Young's modulus of steel, $E_s$ = 200 GPa = $200 × 10^9$ Pa (converting GPa to Pa)

Strain ($ε$) = Stress ($σ$) / Young's modulus ($E_s$)

So, $ε$ = $(25,000,000 Pa) / (200 × 10^9 Pa)$ = $0.000125$.

3. Next, we need to find the lateral (or transverse) strain ($ε_t$) induced in the steel bar using Poisson's ratio ($ν$).

Poisson's ratio ($ν$) is the ratio of the lateral strain to the axial strain.

$ν$ = Lateral strain ($ε_t$) / Axial strain ($ε$)

Given $ν$ = 0.3.

Therefore, $ε_t$ = $ν × ε$ = $0.3 × 0.000125$ = $0.0000375$.

4. Now we need to find the change in diameter ($Δd$) due to the lateral strain.

Original length of the steel bar, $l$ = 1 m
Original cross-sectional area, $A$ = 0.0008 m².

As the steel bar is deforming under tensile load, it would become thinner in diameter.

The area of a circular cross-section is given by:
$A$ = $π(d/2)^2$

So, diameter ($d$) = $2 × \sqrt{\frac{A}{π}}$

$d$ = $2 × \sqrt{\frac{0.0008}{3.1415}}$ = $0.0505m$ 

Change in diameter ($Δd$) = Diameter × Lateral strain
$\Delta d$ = $0.0505m × 0.0000375$ = $0.00000189m$

5. Calculate the new diameter ($d'$) and find the final area of the steel bar, $A'$.

New diameter, $d'$ = Original diameter - Change in diameter
$d'$ = $0.0505m - 0.00000189m$ = $0.05049811m$

Final area, $A'$ = $π(d'/2)^2$
$A'$ = $π(0.05049811/2)^2$ ≈ $0.0008m^2$, or $8.0 cm^²$

Thus, the correct answer is (D) 8.1 $cm^2$.

Final Answer: [D].
