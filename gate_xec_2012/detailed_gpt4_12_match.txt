Let's go through each material and match them with their applications:

P. Titanium diboride
- Titanium diboride is a very hard and resistant material due to the presence of strong covalent bonds. It is extremely stable and used as a high-temperature and high-strength material.
- Therefore, it matches with option 3 (Ultra high temperature material).

Q. Molybdenum disilicide
- Molybdenum disilicide is known for its excellent resistance to oxidation and corrosion, making it an ideal material for heating elements. It is widely used as a high-temperature heating element in furnaces.
- Therefore, it matches with option 2 (Furnace heating element).

R. Hydroxyapatite
- Hydroxyapatite is a naturally occurring mineral that is the primary compound found in teeth and bones. It has excellent biocompatibility and promotes bone regeneration, making it ideal for artificial bone implants.
- Therefore, it matches with option 5 (Artificial bone implant).

S. Nanocrystalline titanium oxide
- Nanocrystalline titanium oxide is known for its photocatalytic properties, which are useful in a variety of applications including the breakdown of organic pollutants under UV light.
- Therefore, it matches with option 1 (Photocatalyst).

Now we can match the correct options:
P - 3,
Q - 2, 
R - 5, 
S - 1

Looking at the given options, the correct choice is (D) P-3, Q-2, R-5, S-1.
