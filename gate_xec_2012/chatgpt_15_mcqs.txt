We can use the formula to calculate conductivity: 

conductivity = (electron charge) * (electron concentration) * (electron drift velocity) 

First, we need to determine the electron charge, which is commonly denoted as "e". The value of e is 1.602 * 10^-19 C. 

Now we can substitute the given values: 

conductivity = (1.602 * 10^-19 C) * (5 * 10^18 /m^3) * (100 m/s) 
conductivity = 8.01 * 10^-1 S/m 

Therefore, the conductivity of the semiconductor is 0.801 S/m. 

Answer: (none of the given options match the result calculated)
