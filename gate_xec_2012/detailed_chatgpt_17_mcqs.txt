Given data:

$C_{\%}=0.45$

$T_1=900\ ^\circ C$

$T_2=$ just below eutectoid temperature $=723\ ^\circ C$

$\gamma=0.8\ wt.\% C$

$\alpha=0.02\ wt.\% C$

$Fe_3C=6.67\ wt.\% C$

As per the given reaction,

$\gamma (0.8\ wt.\% C) \rightleftharpoons \alpha (0.02\ wt.\% C) + Fe_3C (6.67\ wt.\% C)$

This reaction represents the eutectoid reaction of the iron-carbon system, which occurs at a constant temperature of 723째C for all percentages of carbon.

During cooling from 900째C to 723째C, the proeutectoid $\alpha$ forms from $\gamma$.

The amount of $\gamma$ transformed to $\alpha$ can be calculated from lever rule,

$\frac{\text{Amount of }\alpha}{\text{Amount of }\gamma + \text{Amount of }\alpha}=\frac{C_0-C_{\gamma}}{C_{\alpha}-C_{\gamma}}$

where $C_0$ is the overall wt.% of carbon in the steel.

$C_0=0.45\ wt.\%$

$C_{\gamma}=0.8\ wt.\%$

$C_{\alpha}=0.02\ wt.\%$

$\therefore \frac{\text{Amount of }\alpha}{\text{Amount of }\gamma + \text{Amount of }\alpha}=\frac{0.43}{0.78}$

$\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\ \ =0.551$

$\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\ \ =55.1\%$

Therefore, the volume % of proeutectoid $\alpha$ just below 723째C for the given steel is 55.1%.

Hence, the answer is  (C) 55.1%.
