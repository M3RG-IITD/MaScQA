To determine which of the given choices is not a Bravais lattice, we must first define what a Bravais lattice is.

A Bravais lattice is an infinite array of discrete points, generated by a set of translation vectors in three-dimensional space (usually denoted as a, b, and c). These lattices are the basic building blocks of crystal structures and can be classified according to the lattice parameters (lengths and angles) and the types of lattice points (symmetrically distinct locations) within the unit cell.

There are 14 distinct types of Bravais lattices in 3D space, divided into 7 crystal systems: cubic, tetragonal, orthorhombic, hexagonal, rhombohedral, monoclinic, and triclinic.

Now let's discuss the given choices:

(A) Simple tetragonal:
This is a Bravais lattice belonging to the tetragonal crystal system, which has equal lattice parameters a = b and an angle of 90 degrees. The lattice points are only at the corners of the unit cell.

(B) Body centered tetragonal:
This is also a Bravais lattice belonging to the tetragonal crystal system. In addition to the corner lattice points, it has a lattice point at the center of the unit cell. 

(C) Base centered orthorhombic:
This is a Bravais lattice belonging to the orthorhombic crystal system, which has unequal lattice parameters a ≠ b ≠ c and angles of 90 degrees. The lattice points are at the corners of the unit cell and at the center of two opposite faces.

(D) Face centered tetragonal:
This is NOT a Bravais lattice. In a face-centered tetragonal lattice, there would be lattice points in the center of all faces, in addition to the corner lattice points. However, this results in additional lattice points collapsing into the center of the unit cell, which makes it equivalent to a body-centered tetragonal lattice. Thus, a face-centered tetragonal lattice does not represent a unique Bravais lattice.

Conclusion:

The correct answer is (D) Face centered tetragonal, as it is not a Bravais lattice.
