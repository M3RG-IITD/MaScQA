To determine the best material for an LED emitting at 380 nm, we need to consider the bandgap of each material. 

The bandgap is the amount of energy needed to promote an electron from the valence band to the conduction band, thereby allowing it to participate in the conduction of electricity. 

A smaller bandgap means less energy is required to move an electron from the valence band to the conduction band, making it easier for the electrons to emit photons and produce light. Conversely, a larger bandgap requires more energy to promote an electron, making it less efficient at producing light.

Additionally, a direct bandgap material is preferred over an indirect bandgap material. In direct bandgap materials, the maximum energy of the valence band and the minimum energy of the conduction band occur at the same momentum value, allowing for more efficient light emission.

With this in mind, we can eliminate options B and C, as they both involve materials with large bandgaps. 

Option D, an indirect bandgap material with a small bandgap, is also not ideal, as indirect bandgap materials are inherently less efficient at producing light. 

Therefore, the most suitable material for an LED emitting at around 380 nm would be option A, a direct bandgap material with a small bandgap. This material will have a more efficient light emission due to its direct bandgap, while the small bandgap will promote an efficient transfer of electrons from the valence to conduction band, allowing for effective light production. 

Answer: 

- (A) Direct bandgap material with a small bandgap
