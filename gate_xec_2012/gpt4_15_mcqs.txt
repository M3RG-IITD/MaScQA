We can calculate the conductivity of the semiconductor using the formula:

conductivity (σ) = (charge of electron) * (electron concentration) * (drift velocity) / (electric field)

The charge of an electron (e) is 1.6 * 10^(-19) C.

Given:
electron concentration (n) = 5 * 10^18/m^3
drift velocity (vd) = 100 m/s
electric field (E) = 500 V/m

Now, let's calculate the conductivity:

σ = (1.6 * 10^(-19) C) * (5 * 10^18/m^3) * (100 m/s) / (500 V/m)

σ = (1.6 * 10^(-19) C) * (5 * 10^18/m^3) * (100 m/s) * (1/(500 V/m))

σ = (1.6 * 5 * 100) * (10^(-19 + 18 - 3)) S/m

σ = 8 * 10^(-1) S/m

Therefore, the conductivity of the semiconductor is 8 * 10^(-1) S/m. This is not one of the given choices. However, 1.60 * $10^(–1)$ S/m (option B) is the closest to the calculated value, so we can choose that as the correct answer.

Answer: [1.60 * $10^(–1)$ S/m]
