Let's analyze each property and match it with the correct option:

P. Toughness: It is the ability of a material to absorb energy and plastically deform without fracturing. It is represented by the area under the stress-strain curve. So, P matches with 4.

Q. Resilience: It is the capacity of a material to store potential energy when deformed elastically and to release it upon unloading. It is represented by the area under the elastic part of the stress-strain curve. So, Q matches with 5.

R. Creep: It is the time-dependent, slow and gradual deformation of a material under a constant load or stress. So, R matches with 2.

S. Hardness: It is the resistance to plastic deformation, usually by indentation or abrasion. So, S matches with 1.

Hence, the correct answer is P-4, Q-5, R-2, S-1. This matches with option (C).

Answer: [(C) P-4, Q-5, R-2, S-1]
