We can use the lever rule to determine the volume % of proeutectoid α. The lever rule states that the volume % of a phase = (opposing phase's composition - overall composition) / (opposing phase's composition - our phase's composition).

In this case, the total carbon percentage in the steel is 0.45 wt.% C. So, let's apply the lever rule for proeutectoid α:

Volume % of proeutectoid α = ((6.67 - 0.45) / (6.67 - 0.02)) * 100
                                           = (6.22 / 6.65) * 100
                                           = 0.9353 * 100
                                           = 93.53%

However, this is the volume % of proeutectoid α phase in the mixture of α and $Fe_3C$ formed only during the cooling from 900°C to 723°C. We also need to consider the volume % of γ phase that remains unreacted just below 723°C. The lever rule for the remaining γ phase at 723°C is:

Volume % of γ = ((0.45 - 0.02) / (0.8 - 0.02)) * 100
                    = (0.43 / 0.78) * 100
                    = 0.5513 * 100
                    = 55.13%

Since the initial steel is 100% γ phase, now 55.13% is still in γ and the remaining 44.87% is in the mixture of α and $Fe_3C$. Now we have to multiply this remaining percentage (44.87% mixture) with the percentage of proeutectoid α in that mixture.

Volume % of proeutectoid α in steel = 0.4487 * 0.9353 * 100
                                                    = 41.97%

The given options do not have the exact answer, but the closest option is (A) 44.9%.

The correct answer is: [44.9]
