The correct option is (B) Backscattered electron.

Explanation:

When incident electrons hit a material, they can undergo elastic scattering or inelastic scattering. In elastic scattering, the incident electrons collide with the atomic electrons of the material and change direction without losing energy. In contrast, in inelastic scattering, the incident electrons lose some of their energy as they excite the target material's atoms, generating various signals.

The backscattered electron signal comes from elastic scattering of primary electrons. These electrons are initially accelerated by an electric field and strike the surface of the sample. If the collision of these electrons with the atoms of the target is purely elastic, a portion of them will be deflected back towards the detector. The number of backscattered electrons depends on the atomic number and density of the sample, as well as the energy and angle of incidence of the primary beam.

Secondary electrons are generated by inelastic scattering of the primary beam electrons within a few nanometers of the sample surface. Auger electrons are generated by inelastic scattering of primary electrons when the ejected electron energy level is filled by an outer-shell electron, and photoelectrons are generated by the ionizing radiation such as the X-rays striking an electron in the inner shell of an atom, causing its ejection from the atom.
