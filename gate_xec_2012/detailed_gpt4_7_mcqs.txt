We are given four materials and asked to determine which has the lowest specific heat capacity at room temperature.

Specific heat capacity is a measure of the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one unit mass of that substance by one degree Celsius (°C). A lower specific heat capacity indicates that the substance heats up or cools down more quickly when energy is applied or removed.

Let's list the specific heat capacities for each substance:

A) Water: 4.18 J/g°C
B) Mercury: 0.14 J/g°C
C) Copper: 0.39 J/g°C
D) Silver: 0.24 J/g°C

Now, let us compare the values to find the substance with the lowest specific heat capacity:

Water (4.18 J/g°C) is greater than the other three substances, so it cannot have the lowest specific heat capacity.

Mercury (0.14 J/g°C) is less than Copper (0.39 J/g°C) and Silver (0.24 J/g°C), making it the lowest of the remaining substances.

Therefore, Mercury (B) has the lowest specific heat capacity at room temperature.

The correct answer is [B].
