Given: 
Load applied, P = 20 kN
Cross-sectional area of steel, A1 = 8 cm^2
Length of the steel bar, L1 = 1 m
Young's modulus of steel, E1 = 200 GPa
Young's modulus of aluminum, E2 = 70 GPa
Poisson's ratio, v = 0.3
Cross-sectional area of aluminum bar, A2 = ?

Elastic strain, ε1 = ε2
When the tensile load is applied to steel, the stress developed in it is given by:
σ1 = P/A1
Using the relation between stress and strain for an axial load,
σ1/E1 = ε1
ε1 = σ1/E1
Similarly, when the same load is applied to the aluminum bar, the stress developed in it is given by:
σ2 = P/A2
Using the relation between stress and strain for an axial load,
σ2/E2 = ε2
ε2 = σ2/E2
Since ε1 = ε2,
σ1/E1 = σ2/E2
σ2 = σ1 * (E2/E1)
Substituting the values of σ1, E1, and E2
σ2 = (20*10^3 N)/(8*10^-4 m^2) * (70*10^9 N/m^2)/(200*10^9 N/m^2)
σ2 = 21.875 MPa
Using the relation between stress and strain for an axial load,
ε2 = σ2/E2
Substituting the values of σ2 and E2,
ε2 = 21.875*10^6 Pa / (70*10^9 Pa)
ε2 = 3.125*10^-4
When the load is applied to the aluminum bar, the stress developed in it is given by
σ2 = P/A2
Using the relation between stress and strain for an axial load,
σ2/E2 = ε2
σ2 = ε2 * E2
Substituting the value of σ2 and ε2,
P/A2 = 3.125*10^-4 * 70*10^9
A2 = 20*10^3 N / (3.125*10^-4 * 70*10^9)
A2 = 14.93 cm^2 (approx)

Therefore, the cross-sectional area of the aluminum bar is 14.93 $cm^2$ (B).
