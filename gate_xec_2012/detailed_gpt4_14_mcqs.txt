To find the mole fraction of vinyl chloride in the copolymer, we first need to find the number of moles of each monomer in the copolymer.

1. Determine the molecular weight of each monomer.
Vinyl chloride ($CH_2-CHCl$): 
  1C = 12.01 g/mol, 1H = 1.01 g/mol, 1Cl = 35.45 g/mol
  Molecular weight of vinyl chloride = (2x12.01 g/mol) + (3x1.01 g/mol) + (1x35.45 g/mol) = 24.02 g/mol + 3.03 g/mol + 35.45 g/mol = 62.5 g/mol

Vinyl acetate ($CH_2-CH-OCOCH_3$): 
  1C = 12.01 g/mol, 1H = 1.01 g/mol, 1O = 16.0 g/mol
  Molecular weight of vinyl acetate = (4x12.01 g/mol) + (6x1.01 g/mol) + (2x16.0 g/mol) = 48.04 g/mol + 6.06 g/mol + 32.0 g/mol = 86.1 g/mol

2. Let's assume that there are 'x' moles of vinyl chloride and 'y' moles of vinyl acetate in the copolymer.

3. Using the degree of polymerization (160), we can write the following equation:
  x + y = 160

4. We can also deduce the following equation with molecular weight (10520 g/mol) information:
  62.5x g/mol + 86.1y g/mol = 10520 g/mol

5. Now, we need to solve the system of equations for x and y. 

First, we'll solve equation 3 for y:
  y = 160 - x

Now plug this value of y into equation 4:
  62.5x + 86.1(160 - x) = 10520

6. Solve the equation for x
  62.5x + 13776 - 86.1x = 10520
  -23.6x = -3256
  x = 137.97 

Since the number of moles must be an integer, we'll round x to the nearest integer, which is 138.

7. Now, plug x back into the equation for y to find the value of y:
  y = 160 - 138 = 22

8. Find the mole fraction of vinyl chloride.
Mole fraction of vinyl chloride = (moles of vinyl chloride) / (total moles of monomers in the copolymer)
Mole fraction of vinyl chloride = x / (x + y) = 138 / (138 + 22) = 138/160 = 0.8625

The mole fraction of vinyl chloride in the copolymer is approximately 0.86.

The correct answer is (D) 0.86.
