To solve this question, we need to know the techniques used to grow single crystals of semiconductors and eliminate the one that is not used. 

(A) Calendering is a process used to create thin sheets of material by passing them through rollers. This technique is not used to grow single crystals of semiconductors, so it could be the answer.

(B) Czochralski is a method commonly used to grow single crystals of semiconductors. In this method, a small seed crystal is dipped into a molten semiconductor material, and slowly pulled out while rotating. As the seed crystal is pulled out, the molten material solidifies around it, forming a long crystal.

(C) Float zone is another method used to grow single crystals of semiconductors. In this method, a rod of high-purity semiconductor material is partially melted, and then slowly moved through a high-temperature zone, creating a molten zone in the material behind it. As the rod is moved, the molten zone moves with it, creating a long, single crystal.

(D) Bridgman method is a process used to create crystals from small pieces of different materials by melting them together in a crucible. This technique is also used to grow single crystals of semiconductors by slowly cooling the molten material, so that a crystal forms from the bottom up.

Therefore, the answer is (A) Calendering.
