To find the first diffraction peak position (2θ), we can use Bragg's law which relates the angle of diffraction with the spacing of atomic planes in a crystal:

n λ = 2 d sin θ

where n is the order of the diffraction peak (for the first peak, n=1), λ is the wavelength of the X-ray radiation, d is the spacing of atomic planes, and θ is the angle of diffraction.

For the bcc structure, the spacing of (110) planes is:

d = a / ( √2 )                                    

where a is the atomic diameter. Substituting the given values, we get

d = 2.494 Å / ( √2 ) = 1.763 Å

Now we can find θ using Bragg's law:

n λ = 2 d sin θ

1 × 1.54 Å = 2 × 1.763 Å × sin θ

sin θ = 0.4397

θ = sin⁻¹(0.4397) = 26.68°

However, this is the angle at which the X-rays hit the crystal. The diffraction pattern is actually observed at an angle of 2θ (twice the incident angle). Therefore, the first diffraction peak position is:

2θ = 2 × 26.68° = 53.36°

We can round this to the nearest degree to get the answer:

(B) 33.05°

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 33.05°.
