The dihedral angle (𝜙) can be calculated during sintering by the Young's Equation, which relates the interfacial energies of solid-solid $(γ_{SS})$, solid-liquid $(γ_{SL})$, and liquid-liquid $(γ_{LL})$. The equation is as follows:

cos(𝜙) = (𝛾_(𝑆𝑆) - 𝛾_(𝑆𝐿)) / 𝛾_(𝐿𝐿)

We have the given values for solid-solid interfacial energy $(𝛾_(𝑆𝑆))$ as 0.87 𝐽. $𝑚^(−2)$ and solid-liquid interfacial energy $(𝛾_(𝑆𝐿))$ as 0.5 𝐽. $𝑚^(−2)$. However, we do not have the liquid-liquid interfacial energy $(𝛾_(𝐿𝐿))$ value.

Since we don't have 𝛾_(𝐿𝐿), we will use the Neumann's Triangle, a geometrical construction-based approach to derive the current value of the interfacial energies between the three existing phases (𝑆𝑆, 𝑆𝐿, 𝐿𝐿). Assuming 𝛾_(𝐿𝐿) is constant (which is also assumed in Young's Equation), Neumann's Triangle can be used to find the dihedral angle (𝜙).

Neumann's Triangle is an equilateral triangle with sides of length 𝑎 (the lattice constant) in the 𝑆𝑆-𝑆𝐿-𝐿𝐿 plane. 𝜙 is the angle between the 𝑆𝑆-𝑆𝐿 and the 𝑆𝑆-𝐿𝐿 vectors as shown below:

                             /\                        (LL)
                           /    \
                     a  /____\  a                    (SL)

                       SS        SL
                       
We can use the Law of Cosines in this equilateral triangle to find the dihedral angle (𝜙):

cos(𝜙) = (a^2 + a^2 - a^2) / (2 * a * a)
cos(𝜙) = (2*a^2 - a^2) / (2*a^2)
cos(𝜙) = (a^2) / (2*a^2)
cos(𝜙) = 1 / 2

So, taking the inverse cosine:

𝜙 = arccos(1 / 2)
𝜙 = arccos(0.5)
𝜙 ≈ 60°

Therefore, the dihedral angle (𝜙) during sintering is approximately 60 degrees (rounded off to one decimal place).
