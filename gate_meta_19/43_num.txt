Given: Sieverts’ law constant as a function of temperature (T; in Kelvin) is $log_(10)K_[n]$ = [-518/T - 1.063], where $𝐾_[𝑁]$ has the dimension of $𝑎𝑡𝑚^(−(1/2))$. Assume [$h_N$]= [wt.%N], where [$h_N$] N h is the activity of nitrogen with respect to 1 wt.% Henrian standard state. Equilibrium concentration of dissolved nitrogen (in wt.%, rounded off to three decimal places) in pure liquid iron, exposed to atmospheric air at 1873 K, is?
