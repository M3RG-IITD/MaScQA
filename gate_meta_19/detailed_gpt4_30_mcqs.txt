A scanning electron microscope (SEM) is a powerful tool that uses focused electron beams to create high-resolution images of a sample. Images are generated in SEM by collecting signals produced as a result of the interaction between the electron beam and the sample. 

There are different types of signals produced during this interaction, and each signal provides specific information about the sample. In the context of this question, we need to find which signals tell us about the topography and atomic contrast in the SEM images.

Here's a brief description of each type of electron mentioned in the options:

(A) Secondary electron (SE):
Secondary electrons are electrons that are emitted from the sample after they gain energy from the primary electron beam. These electrons are low energy (<50 eV) and primarily result from the inelastic scattering of primary electrons. Secondary electrons are highly sensitive to the surface topography of the sample and are commonly used to provide information about surface morphologies in SEM images.

Auger electron:
Auger electrons are produced when the primary electron beam ionizes an electron from an inner shell of an atom in the sample. This creates an electron vacancy which is then filled by an electron from a higher energy level. In turn, the energy from the transition is transferred to another outer-shell electron, which gets ejected from the atom. Auger electrons provide information about the elemental composition of a sample, but they are not ideal for providing atomic contrast in SEM images due to their low energy and high escape depth.

(B) Primary electron:
Primary electrons are the electrons generated in the electron source and focused onto the sample to create the images. In SEM, the information obtained from these electrons is not essential, since they do not interact with the sample.

(C) Back-scatter electron (BSE):
Back-scatter electrons are high-energy electrons that are reflected from the sample after interacting with the primary electron beam. Their intensity is directly related to the atomic number of the elements in the sample, which means that back-scatter electrons can provide atomic contrast in SEM images.

Now, let's analyze the options and find the correct answer:

(A) Secondary electron and Auger electron, respectively.
As mentioned before, Auger electrons do not provide sufficient atomic contrast in SEM images.

(B) Primary electron and secondary electron, respectively.
Primary electrons do not generate any useful information in SEM images.

(C) Secondary electron and back-scatter electron, respectively.
This option fits our analysis because secondary electrons provide information about the sample's topography, while back-scatter electrons provide atomic contrast. 

(D) Back-scatter electron and Auger electron, respectively.
As mentioned before, Auger electrons do not provide sufficient atomic contrast in SEM images.

Hence, based on our analysis above, the correct answer for information about topography and atomic contrast in SEM images are obtained from:

Answer: [C] Secondary electron and back-scatter electron
