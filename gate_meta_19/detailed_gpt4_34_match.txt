Let's analyze each automobile component and match it with the corresponding manufacturing process:

P) Engine block: The engine block, also known as the cylinder block, is made from a complex casting made from cast iron or aluminum alloy. It houses the cylinders, coolant passages, and other components of the engine. The manufacturing process used for engine blocks is casting. So, P-3.

Q) Brake pad: Brake pads are typically made from a blend of metallic, ceramic, or organic materials that are pressed and bonded together using a process called Powder Metallurgy. The process involves compaction and sintering, which transforms the powder blend into a solid, cohesive material. So, Q-4.

R) Connecting rod: Connecting rods are one of the most stressed components in an engine, as they transfer the force generated by the combustion process to the crankshaft. They are usually made from steel and are made using the forging process. Forging provides improved mechanical properties and an optimized grain structure, which enhances the fatigue resistance of the material. So, R-1.

S) Door panel: Door panels of automobiles are usually made from sheet metal, which is a lightweight and cost-effective material. The manufacturing process used to make door panels is Sheet Metal Forming. This process involves various operations like cutting, bending, and stamping to create the desired shape and design. So, S-2.

Now, we have the correct matches:

P-3, Q-4, R-1, S-2

The correct answer is (B) P-3, Q-4, R-1, S-2.
