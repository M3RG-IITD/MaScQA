Given the steady-state radial heat conduction equation for a hollow, infinitely long zirconia cylinder:

d/dr (r * dT/dr) = 0

with the boundary conditions:

T(r=0.05) = 1473 K
T(r=0.07) = 973 K

To solve this differential equation, we first integrate with respect to r:

∫d/dr (r * dT/dr) dr = ∫0 dr
r * dT/dr = C1
dT/dr = C1/r

Now, we integrate once more with respect to r:

∫dT/dr dr = ∫C1/r dr
T(r) = C1 ln|r| + C2

Now, we use the boundary conditions to find the constants C1 and C2.

T(r=0.05) = 1473 K:
1473 = C1 ln(0.05) + C2

T(r=0.07) = 973 K:
973 = C1 ln(0.07) + C2

Now, we have a system of two equations and two unknowns. Let's solve for C1 and C2:

From the first equation:
C2 = 1473 - C1 ln(0.05)

Substitute this expression for C2 into the second equation:

973 = C1 ln(0.07) + 1473 - C1 ln(0.05)

Now, solve for C1:

C1 (ln(0.07) - ln(0.05)) = 500
C1 = 500 / (ln(0.07) - ln(0.05))

Now, calculate the numerical value of C1:

C1 ≈ -9523.82

Now, substitute the value of C1 back into the expression for C2:

C2 = 1473 - (-9523.82) ln(0.05)

Now, calculate the numerical value of C2:

C2 ≈ 12782.55

Now, we have the equation for temperature as a function of radial distance:

T(r) = -9523.82 ln|r| + 12782.55

Now, to find the rate of heat loss per unit length (Q) through the outer surface of the hollow cylinder, we can use Fourier's law of heat conduction:

q = -k * dT/dr

Evaluate at the outer surface, r = 0.07:

q(r=0.07) = -2 * (-9523.82/0.07) = 271079.43 W/m

Finally, we round off the rate of heat loss per unit length to the nearest integer:

Q = 271079 W/m

The correct answer inside a list is:

[271079]
