To find the equilibrium concentration of dissolved nitrogen in pure liquid iron, we need to use Sieverts' law, which states:

$[$h_N$]_{eq} = K_N * p_N^{(1/2)}$,

where $[$h_N$]_{eq}$ is the equilibrium concentration of dissolved nitrogen, $K_N$ is the Sieverts' law constant, and $p_N$ is the partial pressure of nitrogen.

First, let's find the Sieverts' law constant ($K_N$) using the provided function:

$log_{10}K_N = -\frac{518}{T} - 1.063$

Given that the temperature is 1873 K, we can compute $log_{10}K_N$:

$log_{10}K_N = -\frac{518}{1873} - 1.063 \approx -1.313$

Now, let's find $K_N$ by taking the antilogarithm:

$K_N = 10^{-1.313} \approx 0.048 \, atm^{-(1/2)}$

The partial pressure of nitrogen ($p_N$) in the atmospheric air can be calculated using the molar fraction of nitrogen ($\chi_N$) and the atmospheric pressure ($P_{atm}$):

$p_N = \chi_N * P_{atm}$

Nitrogen makes up approximately 78% of the Earth's atmosphere, so:

$\chi_N \approx 0.78$

Assuming that atmospheric pressure is 1 atm (which is a reasonable approximation for many calculations):

$p_N = 0.78 * 1 atm \approx 0.78 \, atm$

Now, we can calculate the equilibrium concentration of dissolved nitrogen:

$[$h_N$]_{eq} \approx K_N * p_N^{(1/2)} \approx 0.048 * (0.78)^{(1/2)}$

$[$h_N$]_{eq} \approx 0.048 * 0.883 \approx 0.042$

Rounding off to three decimal places:

$[$h_N$]_{eq} \approx 0.042 \, wt.\%$

So, the equilibrium concentration of dissolved nitrogen in pure liquid iron exposed to atmospheric air at 1873 K is approximately 0.042 wt.%.

Answer: [0.042].
