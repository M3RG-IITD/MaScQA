To find the critical radius of a nickel nucleus during solidification, we can use the Gibbs-Thomson equation. The Gibbs-Thomson equation relates the critical radius (r) with the melting temperature (T), the equilibrium melting temperature (T_m), the enthalpy of fusion (ΔH), and the liquid-solid interfacial energy (γ). The equation is given by:

$$
\frac{T_m - T}{T_m} = \frac{2γ}{rΔH}
$$

We can rearrange the equation to solve for r:

$$
r = \frac{2γ}{ΔH} \frac{T_m}{T_m - T}
$$

Now, we can plug in the given values:

ΔH = 2.65 × $10^9$ 𝐽.$𝑚^(−3)$
γ = 0.5 𝐽.𝑚^(−2)$
T_m = 1728 K
T = 1673 K

$$
r = \frac{2 × 0.5}{2.65 × 10^9} \frac{1728}{1728 - 1673}
$$

$$
r = \frac{1}{2.65 × 10^9} \frac{1728}{55}
$$

Let's calculate the value of r:

$$
r ≈ \frac{1}{2.65 × 10^9} × \frac{1728}{55} ≈ 1.18696 × 10^{-9} \, \text{m}
$$

We need to convert the critical radius to nm:

$$
1.18696 × 10^{-9} \, \text{m} × \frac{10^9 \, \text{nm}}{1 \, \text{m}} ≈ 1.2 \, \text{nm}
$$

The critical radius of the nickel nucleus during solidification at 1673 K is approximately 1.2 nm. So the final answer is:
