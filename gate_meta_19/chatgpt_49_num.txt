We can use the rule of mixtures to find the overall elastic modulus of the material. The rule of mixtures states that the overall property of a composite material is the weighted average of the properties of its constituents. 

In this case, the material is made up of alternating layers of metals A and B. Since the volume % of B is 25%, we know that the volume % of A is also 25% (since there are only two materials). Therefore, we can calculate the overall elastic modulus as follows:

E = 0.25(200 GPa) + 0.25(100 GPa)
  = 50 GPa + 25 GPa
  = 75 GPa

Answer: 

- 75 GPa.
