The equilibrium concentration of dissolved nitrogen in pure liquid iron can be calculated using the following equation:

$$\frac{h_N}{h_{N,\text{st}}} = \frac{P_N}{K_N}$$

where $h_N$ is the activity of nitrogen in the liquid iron, $h_{N,\text{st}}$ is the activity of nitrogen in the Henrian standard state (which is defined as 1 wt.% of nitrogen), $P_N$ is the partial pressure of nitrogen in the atmosphere, and $K_N$ is the equilibrium constant for the dissolution of nitrogen in iron.

First, we need to convert the given equation for $K_N$ from base $e$ to base 10, by using the formula $log_{10}x = ln x / ln 10$:

$$log_{10}K_N = \frac{-518}{T} - 1.063$$

$$K_N = 10^{(-518/T - 1.063)}$$

Next, we need to calculate the partial pressure of nitrogen in the atmosphere at 1873 K. According to Dalton's law of partial pressures, the total pressure of the atmosphere is the sum of the partial pressures of its constituent gases. Since the atmosphere is assumed to be in equilibrium with the liquid iron, the partial pressure of nitrogen in the atmosphere is given by the following expression:

$$P_N = \frac{h_N}{h_{N,\text{st}}} P_{N,\text{sat}}$$

where $P_{N,\text{sat}}$ is the saturation pressure of nitrogen at the given temperature. The saturation pressure of nitrogen can be looked up in a reference table or calculated using the Antoine equation, but since the question does not provide such information, we will assume it to be 1 atm.

Therefore, we have:

$$P_N = \frac{h_N}{h_{N,\text{st}}} P_{N,\text{sat}} = h_N \times 1 \text{ atm}$$

Now we can plug in the values given in the problem and solve for $h_N$:

$$T = 1873 \text{ K}$$

$$log_{10}K_N = [-518/T - 1.063]$$

$$K_N = 10^{(-518/T - 1.063)} = 1.071 \times 10^{-6} \text{ atm}^{-1/2}$$

$$P_N = h_N \times 1 \text{ atm}$$

Substituting $K_N$ and $P_N$ into the equation for $h_N$, we get:

$$h_N = \frac{P_N}{K_N} = \frac{1 \text{ atm}}{1.071 \times 10^{-6} \text{ atm}^{-1/2}} = 935.461 \text{ wt.% N}$$

Therefore, the equilibrium concentration of dissolved nitrogen in pure liquid iron is 9.355 wt.%, rounded off to three decimal places.
