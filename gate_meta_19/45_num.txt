Given: Assume ideal gas behavior, and molar volume of the gas at NTP is 22.4 liter.  A blast furnace charged with hematite containing 90 wt.% $Fe_(2)O_(3)$ produces liquid iron with 3.6 wt.% carbon. Coke containing 90 wt.% carbon is charged at a rate of 500 kg per Metric ton of liquid iron produced. The blast furnace top gas contains (by volume), 22% CO, 18% $CO_2$, and balance nitrogen. The volume of the blast furnace top gas [in $m^3$ (NTP), rounded off to the nearest integer] is
