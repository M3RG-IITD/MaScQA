We can solve this problem by using similar triangles and differentiating. Let x be the horizontal distance from the wall to the bottom of the rod, and y be the vertical distance from the floor to the top of the rod.

Since the length of the rod is fixed at 50 cm and forms a right-angled triangle with the wall and floor, we have the following Pythagorean relation:

x^2 + y^2 = 50^2

When the bottom of the rod is 30 cm away from the wall, we have:

30^2 + y^2 = 50^2
y^2 = 50^2 - 30^2
y^2 = 2500 - 900
y^2 = 1600
y = 40 cm

Now we need to find the instantaneous velocity of the top of the rod as it slides down the wall. To do this, we differentiate the Pythagorean relation with respect to time (t):

2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0

Here, dx/dt is the velocity of the bottom of the rod moving horizontally away from the wall, which is given as 4 cm/s. And dy/dt is the velocity of the top of the rod sliding down the wall, which we need to find.

Substituting the values x = 30 cm, dx/dt = 4 cm/s and y = 40 cm in the equation, we have:

2(30)(4) + 2(40)(dy/dt) = 0
240 + 80(dy/dt) = 0
80(dy/dt) = -240

Now, divide by 80 to find dy/dt:

dy/dt = -240 / 80
dy/dt = -3 cm/s

The negative sign implies that the top of the rod is sliding down the wall. So, the magnitude of the instantaneous velocity of the top of the rod sliding down the wall is 3 cm/s. Since the problem asks for the answer to be rounded off to two decimal places, that would be 3.00 cm/s.
