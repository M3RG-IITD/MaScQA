To find the correct answer, let's analyze each reaction and identify the Boudouard or carbon gasification reaction.

First, a brief overview of the Boudouard reaction: it occurs when carbon is in contact with carbon dioxide, so it involves the conversion of one carbon species to another, typically at high temperatures.

Now, let's analyze each reaction:

(A) C(s) + (1/2)O2(g) → CO(g)
In this reaction, solid carbon reacts with oxygen to produce carbon monoxide. This is actually the half-reaction for the formation of carbon monoxide, but it doesn't involve carbon dioxide, so it's not the Boudouard reaction.

(B) C(s) + O2(g) → CO2(g)
In this reaction, solid carbon reacts with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide. This is the combustion reaction of carbon, but it does not involve carbon dioxide as a reactant, so it's not the Boudouard reaction.

(C) C(s)+ CO2(g) → 2CO(g)
In this reaction, solid carbon reacts with carbon dioxide to produce two moles of carbon monoxide. This reaction involves both carbon and carbon dioxide and is a true gasification reaction. This is the Boudouard reaction.

(D) CO(g) + (1/2)O2(g) → CO2(g)
In this reaction, carbon monoxide reacts with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide. This is the half-reaction for the combustion of carbon monoxide, but it doesn't involve the reaction of carbon and carbon dioxide, so it's not the Boudouard reaction.

So, the correct answer for the Boudouard (or carbon gasification) reaction is:
