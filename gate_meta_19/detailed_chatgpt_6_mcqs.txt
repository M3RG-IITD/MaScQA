We are given the variation of standard free energies for two oxides AO and BO with temperature as shown below:

From this graph, we can make the following observations:

(A) AO is a gas - This statement is incorrect. Both AO and BO appear to be solids at all temperatures shown in the graph. There is no indication that AO is a gas.

(B) BO is a gas - This statement is also incorrect for the same reasons as above. BO appears to be a solid at all temperatures shown in the graph.

(C) A will reduce BO above temperature $T_1$ - This statement is correct. The reaction for the reduction of BO is:

$BO(s) + A(g) \rightarrow B(s) + AO(s)$

For this reaction to be spontaneous, $\Delta G$ must be negative. From the graph, we can see that $\Delta G$ for the reaction becomes increasingly negative at temperatures above $T_1$. Therefore, the reaction becomes more favorable and A will reduce BO above $T_1$.

(D) B will reduce AO below temperature $T_1$ - This statement is incorrect. The reverse of the reaction for the reduction of BO is:

$B(s) + AO(s) \rightarrow BO(s) + A(g)$

For this reaction to be spontaneous, $\Delta G$ must be negative. From the graph, we can see that $\Delta G$ for the reverse reaction becomes increasingly positive at temperatures below $T_1$. Therefore, the reverse reaction becomes less favorable and B will not reduce AO below $T_1$.

Therefore, the correct statement is:
- C) A will reduce BO above temperature $T_1$

Answer: [C]
