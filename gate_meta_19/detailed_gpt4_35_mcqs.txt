We are given the values of ∆𝐻°, ∆𝑆 °, 𝑅, and temperature T. We need to find the equilibrium constant for the given reaction at 300 K.

The equation relating Gibbs free energy ∆G°, enthalpy change ∆H°, and entropy change ∆S° is:

∆G° = ∆H° - T∆S°

We are given the values: 

∆H° = -74,900 J/mol
∆S° = -80 J/mol·K
T = 300 K

First, we will calculate the change in Gibbs free energy (∆G°) using the given values:

∆G° = -74,900 J/mol - (300 K × -80 J/mol·K)
∆G° = -74,900 J/mol + 24,000 J/mol
∆G° = -50,900 J/mol

Now, we can use the relationship between the change in Gibbs free energy and the equilibrium constant (K) using the following equation:

∆G° = -RT ln(K)

where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, and ln(K) is the natural logarithm of the equilibrium constant.

Rearrange the equation to solve for K:

K = e^(-∆G°/RT)

We are given the values:

R = 8.314 J/mol·K
T = 300 K
∆G° = -50,900 J/mol

Now, plug in the values and calculate K:

K = e^(-(-50,900 J/mol) / (8.314 J/mol·K × 300 K))
K = e^(50,900 J/mol / 2,494.2 J/mol·K)
K = e^20.42

K ≈ 3.6 × 10^7

Thus, the equilibrium constant for the given reaction at 300 K is approximately 3.6 × 10^7.

The correct answer is (B) 3.6 × 10^7.
