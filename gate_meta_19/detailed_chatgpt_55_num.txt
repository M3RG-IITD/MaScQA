We can use the formula to find the energy input per unit length:

$E = \frac{VI}{v}\eta$,

where:
- $V$ is the voltage (in volts)
- $I$ is the current (in amperes)
- $v$ is the traverse speed (in meters per second)
- $\eta$ is the heat transfer efficiency

Substituting the given values, we get:

$E = \frac{(20)(400)}{(5 \times 10^{-3})}(0.6)$

$E = 1,440,000$ joules/meter

Rounding off to the nearest integer, we get:

$E =$ **1,440,000 joules/meter**

Therefore, the energy input per unit length during the process is 1,440,000 joules/meter.
