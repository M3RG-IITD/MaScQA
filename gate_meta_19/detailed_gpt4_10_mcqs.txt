To solve this question, we need to know which of the given minerals is a common ore of titanium. Let's discuss each option one by one.

A) Bauxite
Bauxite is the primary ore of aluminum, not titanium. It consists mainly of the minerals gibbsite (Al(OH)₃), boehmite (γ-AlO(OH)), and diaspore (α-AlO(OH)), mixed with iron oxides and other impurities. So, Bauxite is not the correct answer.

B) Chalcopyrite
Chalcopyrite is the most common sulfide mineral, and it is the primary ore of copper, not titanium. Chalcopyrite has the chemical formula CuFeS₂. Therefore, Chalcopyrite is not the correct answer.

C) Cassiterite 
Cassiterite is the most important ore of tin, not titanium. It is a tin oxide mineral with the chemical formula SnO₂. So, Cassiterite is not the correct answer.

D) Ilmenite
Now let's check Ilmenite. Ilmenite is a common accessory mineral found in metamorphic and igneous rocks. It is the primary ore of titanium. Ilmenite has the chemical formula FeTiO₃. The mineral occurs in various forms, including black crystals.

Based on this information, Ilmenite is the common ore of titanium.

So, the correct answer is:

[D]
