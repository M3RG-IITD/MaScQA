We need to apply the Buckingham Π theorem to determine the number of independent dimensionless variables needed to describe the phenomenon.

First, determine the number of physical variables (n) in the functional relationship: U = f(d, W, µ, ρ)

We have n = 5 (U, d, W, µ, ρ)

Now, determine the number of fundamental dimensions (m) involving the physical variables:

We have 3 fundamental dimensions: Length (L), mass (M), and time (T)

So, m = 3

Finally, according to the Buckingham Π theorem, the number of independent dimensionless variables (p) needed to describe the phenomenon is given by:

p = n - m

p = 5 - 3

p = 2

Thus, the correct answer is (B) 2. Answer: [2].
