To solve this problem, we first need to find the value of the Sieverts' law constant, $K_N$ at temperature T = 1873 K. Then, we can use this value to find the equilibrium concentration of dissolved nitrogen in liquid iron.

Step 1: Calculate the value of $K_N$ using the given function:

$log_{10}K_N = \frac{-518}{T} - 1.063$

Substitute the temperature value, T = 1873 K:

$log_{10}K_N = \frac{-518}{1873} - 1.063$

$log_{10}K_N ≈ -0.276 - 1.063$

$log_{10}K_N ≈ -1.339$

Now, find $K_N$ by taking the antilog (inverse of logarithm) of $log_{10}K_N$:

$K_N = 10^{-1.339}$

$K_N ≈ 0.0455 \ atm^{-1/2}$

Step 2: Find the partial pressure of Nitrogen ($P_N$) in the atmosphere:

The atmospheric pressure (P) is 1 atm, and the air contains approximately 79% Nitrogen (N) and 21% Oxygen (O). So, we need to find the partial pressure of Nitrogen in the atmosphere:

$P_N = 0.79 * P$

$P_N = 0.79 * 1 \ atm$

$P_N = 0.79 \ atm$

Step 3: Calculate the equilibrium concentration of dissolved nitrogen in liquid iron using Sieverts' law:

Sieverts' law states that the solubility of a gas (in this case, Nitrogen) in a liquid (liquid iron) is proportional to the square root of the gas's partial pressure:

$\%\ h_N = K_N * \sqrt{P_N}$

Substitute the values of $K_N$ and $P_N$:

$h_N = 0.0455 * \sqrt{0.79}$

$h_N ≈ 0.0455 * 0.889$ (rounded to three decimal places)

$h_N ≈ 0.0405$ (rounded to three decimal places)

Thus, the equilibrium concentration of dissolved nitrogen in pure liquid iron when exposed to atmospheric air at 1873 K is approximately 0.0405 wt.%.
