Step 1: 
We will first convert the given value of vapour pressure of pure zinc from atm to torr. 

$p_{zn}°$ = 0.027 atm

1 atm = 760 torr

Therefore, $p_{zn}°$ = 20.52 torr

Step 2:
We need to calculate the mole fraction of zinc in the liquid lead solution. 

0.03 mole % of zinc means:
In 100 moles of the solution, there are 0.03 moles of zinc.

So, mole fraction of zinc = (0.03)/(100) = 0.0003

Step 3:
We will use Raoult's law to calculate the partial pressure of zinc in the liquid lead solution. 

$p_{zn}$ = $γ_{zb}$ * $x_{zn}$ * $p_{pb}°$

where, 
$p_{zn}$ = partial pressure of zinc in the solution
$γ_{zb}$ = Henry's law coefficient of zinc in lead
$x_{zn}$ = mole fraction of zinc in the solution
$p_{pb}°$ = vapour pressure of pure lead

We are given the value of Henry's law coefficient of zinc in lead.

But we need to find the value of vapour pressure of pure lead.

We can use the fact that the sum of the mole fractions of all components in the solution is equal to 1.

Therefore, 
mole fraction of lead = 1 - mole fraction of zinc
= 1 - 0.0003
= 0.9997

Now, we will use the following relation to calculate the vapour pressure of pure lead at 900K: 

$p_{pb}°$ = $p_{pt}$ * X

where, 
$p_{pt}$ = total pressure of the system
= $p_{zn}$ + $p_{pb}$       (by Dalton's law of partial pressures)
= $γ_{zb}$ * $x_{zn}$ * $p_{pb}°$ + $p_{pb}°$
= ($γ_{zb}$ * $x_{zn}$ + 1) * $p_{pb}°$

X = mole fraction of lead in the vapour phase
= $p_{pb}$ / $p_{pt}$ 

We know that the mole fraction of lead in the solution is 0.9997. 

At equilibrium, the mole fractions of all components in the vapour phase will be proportional to their partial pressures.

Therefore, mole fraction of lead in the vapour phase = partial pressure of lead / total pressure
= $p_{pb}$ / ($p_{zn}$ + $p_{pb}$)
= 1 / (1 + $p_{zn}$ / $p_{pb}$)

We are given the value of $p_{zn}$ and we can calculate $p_{pb}$ from the vapour pressure of pure zinc at 900K using Dalton's law of partial pressures. 

$p_{pb} = p_{pt} - p_{zn}$

$p_{pt}$ = total pressure of the system
= $p_{zn}$ + $p_{pb}$

We can also convert all pressures to atm so that the units are consistent. 

$p_{zn}$ = 20.52 torr = 20.52 * $10^(-3)$ atm

1 torr = 1.316 * $10^(-3)$ atm

Therefore, $p_{zn}$ = 0.027 atm

$p_{pb}$ = $p_{pt}$ - $p_{zn}$
= 1 - 0.027
= 0.973 atm

Now, we can calculate the mole fraction of lead in the vapour phase. 

mole fraction of lead in the vapour phase = 1 / (1 + $p_{zn}$ / $p_{pb}$)
= 1 / (1 + 0.027 / 0.973)
= 0.9729

Therefore, X = 0.9729

Now, we can calculate the vapour pressure of pure lead at 900K. 

$p_{pb}°$ = $p_{pt}$ * X / ( $γ_{zb}$ * $x_{zn}$ + X )
= 1 * 0.9729 / ( 8.55 * 0.0003 + 0.9729)
= 0.9709 atm

We can convert this value to torr. 

$p_{pb}°$ = 0.9709 atm = 737.98 torr

Step 4:
We can now calculate the partial pressure of zinc in the solution. 

$p_{zn}$ = $γ_{zb}$ * $x_{zn}$ * $p_{pb}°$

= 8.55 * 0.0003 * 737.98 

= 1.632 torr (rounded off to 2 decimal places)

Therefore, the partial pressure of zinc in equilibrium with liquid lead containing 0.03 mole % of zinc at 900K is 1.63 torr.
