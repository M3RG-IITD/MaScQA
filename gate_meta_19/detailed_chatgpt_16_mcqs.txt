Twinning is a deformation mechanism in metals and alloys in which a portion of the crystal lattice is mirrored across a plane (the twin plane) and the atoms on either side of this plane switch positions. 

At room temperature and low strain rates, Mg is the metal that deforms by twinning mode. 

Explanation:

- Fe: Fe has a body-centered cubic (BCC) crystal structure at room temperature, which does not favor twinning deformation. Instead, Fe deforms by slip mechanisms.
- Mg: Mg has a hexagonal close-packed (HCP) crystal structure at room temperature, which is favorable for twinning. At low strain rates, twinning is the dominant deformation mechanism in Mg.
- Al: Al has a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure at room temperature, which does not favor twinning deformation. Instead, Al deforms by slip mechanisms.
- Ni: Ni has a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure at room temperature, which does not favor twinning deformation. Instead, Ni deforms by slip mechanisms.

Therefore, the answer is (B) Mg.
