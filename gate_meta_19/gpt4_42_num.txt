First, let's find the molar concentration of oxygen in the gas mixture.

The partial pressure of oxygen (p_O2) = 40% of 1 atm = 0.40 atm

Using the Ideal Gas Law: PV = nRT, where P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the amount of substance (in moles), R is the universal gas constant, and T is the temperature.

Rearranging to find the concentration (C_O2) = n/V = P/(RT)

C_O2 = (0.4 atm) / (8.205 × 10^(-5) 𝑚³.𝑎𝑡𝑚.𝐾^(−1).𝑚𝑜𝑙^(−1) × 1173 K) = 438.12 mol/m³

Next, calculate the oxygen flux (J_O2) using the boundary layer mass transfer coefficient (k) and the concentration difference:

J_O2 = k × (C_O2 - 0)
J_O2 = 0.03 m/s × 438.12 mol/m³ = 13.1436 mol/m²⋅s

Now, we need to determine the surface area (A) of the sphere for oxidation:

A = 4πr², where r is the radius of the sphere.

Given the diameter of 50 mm, the radius (r) is 25 mm or 0.025 m.

A = 4π × (0.025 m²) = 0.007854 m²

Now, find the rate of oxidation (R_O2) in terms of moles of oxygen per second:

R_O2 = J_O2 × A
R_O2 = 13.1436 mol/m²⋅s × 0.007854 m² = 0.10324 mol/s

To convert this into moles per minute:

R_O2(min) = 0.10324 mol/s × 60 s/min = 6.19 mol/min

Now, to find the rate of oxidation of nickel (R_Ni), we must consider the stoichiometry of the reaction: 

Ni + 1/2 O₂ → NiO

For each mole of nickel oxidized, half a mole of oxygen is consumed. So, the rate of oxidation of nickel (R_Ni) is twice the rate of oxidation of oxygen:

R_Ni = 2 × R_O2(min)
R_Ni = 2 × 6.19 mol/min = 12.38 mol/min

Rounded off to two decimal places, the rate of oxidation of nickel is:

R_Ni ≈ [12.38] mol/min
