We can start our solution by using the rule of mixtures for composite materials, which states that the overall elastic modulus of a composite material can be calculated as a weighted average of the individual elastic moduli of its constituent materials. The weights are determined by the volumetric fractions of the materials in the composite.

In this case, we are given that the composite material is made up of alternating layers of metals A and B, with a volume fraction of B of 25%. This means that the volume fraction of A is also 75%.

Using the rule of mixtures, we can now calculate the overall elastic modulus of the composite:

E = (V_A * E_A) + (V_B * E_B)

where E is the overall elastic modulus of the composite, V_A and V_B are the volume fractions of metals A and B, and E_A and E_B are the respective elastic moduli of metals A and B.

Substituting the given values, we get:

E = (0.75 * 200 GPa) + (0.25 * 100 GPa)
E = 175 GPa

Therefore, the elastic modulus of the material is 175 GPa (rounded off to one decimal place).

Answer:
- 175 GPa
