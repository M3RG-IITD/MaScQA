First, we need to find the total amount of copper present in the copper concentrate.

Copper content in concentrate = 21%
Total weight of copper concentrate = 100 metric tons
Weight of copper = (21% of 100 metric tons) = 0.21 * 100 = 21 metric tons

Now, we need to find the total gram equivalents of copper that we have.

Atomic Weight of copper (Cu) = 63
1 gram equivalent of Cu = atomic weight / valence
Copper has a valence of +2
1 gram equivalent of Cu = 63 / 2 = 31.5 grams

Next, we will calculate the total number of gram equivalents of copper in the 21 metric tons.

1 metric ton = 1,000,000 grams
Total weight of copper in grams = 21 * 1,000,000 = 21,000,000 grams

Number of gram equivalents = total weight of copper / 1 gram equivalent weight
Number of gram equivalents = 21,000,000 / 31.5 = 666,666.67 gram equivalents

Now, we have to find the total charge (in Coulombs) needed to process the copper.

Total Charge = Faraday constant * number of gram equivalents
Total Charge = 96500 * 666,666.67 = 64,333,333,305 Coulombs

Next, we will calculate how much charge has to be provided per month.

Months for processing = 6 months
Working days per month = 25 days
Working hours per day = 8 hours
Total working hours = 6 * 25 * 8 = 1200 hours

Total Charge per month = Total charge / number of months
Total Charge per month = 64,333,333,305 / 6 = 10,722,222,217.5 Coulombs

Now, we have to find the charge per hour needed for processing the copper concentrate.

Charge per hour = Total charge per month / Total working hours per month
Charge per hour = 10,722,222,217.5 / (25 * 8) = 53,611,111.09 Coulombs

Finally, we will find the minimum current rating per cell per month. There are 10 cells arranged in series, so each cell will have the same current flowing through it.

Minimum current rating = Charge per hour / (Number of cells * 1 hour)
Minimum current rating = 53,611,111.09 / (10 * 1) = 5,361,111.11 Amperes

Rounded off to the nearest integer, the minimum current rating (Ampere) per month per cell is: 5,361,111 Amperes.

The answer is [5,361,111].
