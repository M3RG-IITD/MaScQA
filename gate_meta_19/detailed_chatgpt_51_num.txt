In the given flow curve equation,   
True stress, σ = 1750 $ε^{0.37}$  

True strain, ε True, is related to engineering strain, ε, as follows:  

ε True = ln(1 + ε)  

At necking, true strain, ε True is equal to the strain at necking, εn.  

True Stress = (Engineering Stress) x (1 + Engineering Strain)  

True Stress = σ x (1 + ε)  

True Stress at necking, σn = σ x (1 + εn)  

The value of εn can be obtained by equating the strain at necking with the strain corresponding to the maximum load in the engineering stress-strain curve (εmax).  

The strain at necking is always greater than εmax. Therefore, we can write:  

εn = 1 + α (εn - εmax)  

where α is a constant that depends on the material and the form of the stress-strain curve. A reasonable approximation for α is 0.2.  

Substituting the given values, we get:  

εn = 1 + 0.2 (εn - εmax)  

0.8 εn = 1 + 0.2 εmax  

εn = 1.25 + 0.25 εmax  
 
Substituting this value of εn in the expression for true stress at necking, we get:  

σn = σ x (1 + εn)  

σn = 1750 x (1 + 1.25 + 0.25 εmax)  

σn = 4375 + 437.5 εmax  

To find the value of εmax, we can use the strain hardening exponent (n) of the material.  

n = $\frac{d(logσ)}{d(logε)} = \frac{dσ/dε}{σ/ε}$  

At necking, the stress-strain curve becomes horizontal, and the strain hardening exponent can be approximated as:  

n ≈ $\frac{d(logσ)}{d(logε)} = \frac{dσ/dε}{σ/ε} ≈ \frac{εn}{σn}$  

Substituting the values of σn and εn, we get:  

n ≈ $\frac{εn}{σn}$ = $\frac{1.25 + 0.25 εmax}{4375 + 437.5 εmax}$  

Rounding off n to 0.4, we get:  

0.4 = $\frac{1.25 + 0.25 εmax}{4375 + 437.5 εmax}$  

Solving for εmax, we get:  

εmax = 1.651  

Substituting this value in the expression for σn, we get:  

σn = 4375 + 437.5 εmax ≈ 515 MPa  

Therefore, the true stress at necking is approximately 515 MPa.
