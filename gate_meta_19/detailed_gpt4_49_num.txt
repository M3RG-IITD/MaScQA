To find the elastic modulus of the composite material, we can use the Rule of Mixtures, a weighted average of the elastic modulus of each material based on their volume fractions.

Let's denote the elastic modulus of the composite material as E_c.

E_c = V_A * E_A + V_B * E_B

where V_A and V_B are the volume fractions of A and B, respectively, and E_A and E_B are their respective elastic moduli.

Given, E_A = 200 GPa and E_B = 100 GPa. Also, the volume percentage of material B is 25%, therefore V_B = 25/100 = 0.25. Since the composite material is made up only of materials A and B, then V_A = 1 - V_B = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75.

Now, plug in these values into the Rule of Mixtures formula:

E_c = (0.75 * 200 GPa) + (0.25 * 100 GPa)

Simplify the expression:

E_c = (150 GPa) + (25 GPa)

Finally, add the terms:

E_c = 175 GPa

The elastic modulus of the composite material is 175 GPa (rounded to one decimal place).

The correct answer is [175].
