We can start by finding the power of the arc welding, which is the product of current and voltage:

Power = Current × Voltage
Power = 400 A × 20 V
Power = 8000 W (Watts)

Next, we can find the actual power being applied to the material, considering the heat transfer efficiency of 0.6.

Effective Power = Power × Heat Transfer Efficiency
Effective Power = 8000 W × 0.6
Effective Power = 4800 W

Now, we can find the energy input per unit length (in J.mm^(-1)). To do this, we need to divide the effective power by the traverse speed:

Energy Input/Unit Length = Effective Power ÷ Traverse Speed

Before proceeding, we need to convert the given traverse speed from mm.s^(-1) to m.s^(-1).

Traverse Speed = 5 mm.s^(-1) × (1 m / 1000 mm) 
Traverse Speed = 0.005 m.s^(-1)

Now, we can calculate the energy input per unit length:

Energy Input/Unit Length = 4800 W ÷ 0.005 m.s^(-1)
Energy Input/Unit Length = 960000 J.m^(-1)

Since we need the answer in J.mm^(-1), we can convert it by dividing by 1000.

Energy Input/Unit Length = 960000 J.m^(-1) × (1 m / 1000 mm)
Energy Input/Unit Length = 960 J.mm^(-1)

Rounded off to the nearest integer, the energy input per unit length during the arc welding process is 960 J.mm^(-1).

Answer: [960]
