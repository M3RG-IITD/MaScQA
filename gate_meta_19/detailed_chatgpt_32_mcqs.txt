To determine the slip system that will be activated first, we need to find which slip system has the highest resolved shear stress (RSS) on the {1-10} plane, which is the easiest plane on which the aluminum crystal can slip when loaded along the [1 -1 0] axis.

First, let's find the slip direction for the [1 -1 0] axis. We know that the slip direction is perpendicular to the [1 -1 0] axis and lies in the {1-10} plane. Therefore, we can use the cross-product to find the slip direction:

[1 -1 0] x [1 0 0] = [-1 0 1]

This means that the [1 -1 0] axis slips along the [-1 0 1] direction.

Now, let's calculate the resolved shear stress for each of the given slip systems on the {1-10} plane:

(A) (1 -1 -1)[0 -1 1]: the slip direction is [0 -1 1], which is not parallel to the [1 -1 0] axis, so we need to find its projection onto the {1-10} plane. The projection of [0 -1 1] onto [1 -1 0] is [-1 -1 1]. Therefore, the RSS on the {1-10} plane is:

RSS = |[-1 -1 1] dot (1 -1 0)| / sqrt(2) = 1/sqrt(2)

(B) (-1 -1 1)[0 1 1]: the slip direction is [0 1 1], which is not parallel to the [1 -1 0] axis, so we need to find its projection onto the {1-10} plane. The projection of [0 1 1] onto [1 -1 0] is [1 -1 0]. Therefore, the RSS on the {1-10} plane is:

RSS = |[1 -1 0] dot (1 -1 0)| / sqrt(2) = 0

(C) (-1 -1 1)[1 -1 0]: the slip direction is [1 -1 0], which is parallel to the [1 -1 0] axis. Therefore, the RSS on the {1-10} plane is:

RSS = |[1 -1 0] dot (1 -1 0)| / sqrt(2) = 1

(D) (-1 -1 1)[1 0 1]: the slip direction is [1 0 1], which is not parallel to the [1 -1 0] axis, so we need to find its projection onto the {1-10} plane. The projection of [1 0 1] onto [1 -1 0] is [1 1 0]. Therefore, the RSS on the {1-10} plane is:

RSS = |[1 1 0] dot (1 -1 0)| / sqrt(2) = 1/sqrt(2)

Therefore, the slip system with the highest RSS on the {1-10} plane is (C) (-1 -1 1)[1 -1 0]. This is the slip system that will be activated first when the aluminum single crystal is loaded in tension along the [1 -1 0] axis.

Answer: 
(C) (-1 -1 1)[1 -1 0]
