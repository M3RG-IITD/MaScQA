To solve this problem, we need to understand some basic concepts about standard free energy and how it relates to the reduction process of metal oxides.

The standard free energy change (ΔG) for a chemical reaction at a certain temperature can be represented as:

ΔG = ΔH - TΔS

where ΔH is the change in enthalpy (heat content), T is the temperature in Kelvin, and ΔS is the change in entropy (a measure of the disorder/randomness of a system). ΔG determines the spontaneity of a reaction; if ΔG is negative, the reaction is spontaneous, whereas if ΔG is positive, the reaction is non-spontaneous.

In the context of metal oxide reduction, this can be represented by the following general reaction:

AO + B → A + BO

Here, metal A (in oxide AO) is being reduced by metal B. If this reaction is spontaneous (ΔG < 0), metal A will reduce the oxide BO. Conversely, if the reaction is non-spontaneous (ΔG > 0), metal B will reduce the oxide AO.

We are given the variation of standard free energies for two oxides, AO and BO, with temperature. Let's analyze each of the given options:

(A) AO is a gas
For the oxide AO to be in the gas phase, its standard free energy should typically be positive. However, we are not given enough information about the absolute free energy values of the oxides, which makes it impossible to definitively conclude if AO is a gas or not.

(B) BO is a gas
A similar argument as in (A) applies here as well. We don't have enough information to conclude if BO is a gas.

(C) A will reduce BO above temperature $T_1$
Let's analyze the spontaneity of the reaction AO + B → A + BO. For this reaction to be spontaneous, the free energy change, ΔG, should be negative. ΔG for the reaction can be calculated as follows:

ΔG(reaction) = ΔG(BO) - ΔG(AO)

From the given information, it appears that above temperature $T_1$, ΔG(BO) > ΔG(AO). When we plug these values into the above equation, we get:

ΔG(reaction) = Positive value - Smaller positive value

This means that ΔG(reaction) is a positive value above temperature $T_1$, making the reaction non-spontaneous. Therefore, option (C) is incorrect.

(D) B will reduce AO below temperature $T_1$
Below temperature $T_1$, ΔG(AO) > ΔG(BO). Calculating the free energy change for the reaction, we get:

ΔG(reaction) = Smaller positive value - Larger positive value

This means that ΔG(reaction) is a negative value below temperature $T_1$, making the reaction spontaneous.

Hence, B will reduce AO below temperature $T_1$. Option (D) is correct.

We do not have enough information to conclude whether Options A and B are correct, while Option C is incorrect, and Option D is correct. Therefore, the list of correct answers is [D].
