We can solve the given ordinary differential equation using separation of variables. 

$\frac{1}{r}\frac{d}{dr}\left(r\frac{dT}{dr}\right)=0$

$\Rightarrow r\frac{dT}{dr}=C_1$

$\Rightarrow \frac{dT}{dr}=\frac{C_1}{r}$

Integrating both sides with appropriate limits, 

$\int_{T_i}^{T_o}\,dT=\int_{r_i}^{r_o}\frac{C_1}{r}\, dr$

$T_o-T_i=C_1\ln\frac{r_o}{r_i}$

We know the inner surface of the hollow cylinder is maintained at 1473 K and the outer surface at 973 K. Therefore, $T_i=1473\, K, T_o=973\, K, r_i=0.05\, m$ and $r_o=0.07\, m$. 

$C_1=\frac{T_o-T_i}{\ln\frac{r_o}{r_i}}=\frac{973-1473}{\ln\frac{0.07}{0.05}}\approx-4469.65$

The negative sign of $C_1$ indicates that the temperature decreases radially outwards. 

The rate of heat flow per unit length through the outer surface of the hollow cylinder is given by the Fourier's law of heat conduction as 
$Q=-kA\frac{dT}{dr}$, 
where $k$ is the thermal conductivity of zirconia and $A$ is the surface area through which heat flows. 

Since it is an infinitely long cylinder, the length doesn't matter. Hence, 
$\frac{dQ}{dz}=-k2\pi L\frac{dT}{dr}$

$\Rightarrow \frac{dQ}{dz}=-2k\pi L\frac{C_1}{r}$

$\Rightarrow Q=-2k\pi L C_1\ln\frac{r_o}{r_i}$

Plugging in the values, 

$Q=-2\times 2 \times \pi \times 0.005 \times 4469.65 \ln\frac{0.07}{0.05}\approx \boxed{-219\, W/m}$
