Given:
- Hematite containing 90 wt.% $Fe_2O_3$
- Liquid iron containing 3.6 wt.% Carbon
- Coke containing 90 wt.% Carbon charged at a rate of 500 kg per metric ton of liquid iron produced

We need to find the volume of the blast furnace top gas at NTP.

Let's find the moles of coke and moles of $Fe_2O_3$ in hematite.

Moles of coke ($C_{coke}$) = 500 kg * (90/100) / 12 kg/mol (molar mass of C) = 500 * 0.9 / 12 mol = 37.5 mol
Moles of $Fe_2O_3$ in hematite ($Fe_{2}O_{3_{hematite}}$) = 1000 kg * (90/100) / 160 kg/mol (molar mass of Fe2O3) = 900 / 160 mol = 5.625 mol

Now, let's balance the reaction in the blast furnace:

1. $Fe_2O_3$ (s) + 3C (s) → 2Fe (l) + 3$CO$ (g)
2. $CO$ (g) + C (s) → 2$CO_2$ (g)

Moles of carbon in liquid iron = 1000 kg * (3.6/100) / 12 kg/mol (molar mass of C) = 1000 * 0.036 / 12 mol = 3 mol

From reaction 1:
Moles of $Fe_2O_3$ consumed ($Fe_{2}O_{3_{consumed}}$) = 3 mol / 3 = 1 mol
Moles of $CO$ produced = 3 mol

From reaction 2:
Moles of $CO_2$ produced = (37.5 - 3) / 2 = 17.25 mol

Now, let's find the volume of the top gas.

Mole fraction of $CO$ = 22/100; Mole fraction of $CO_2$ = 18/100; Mole fraction of N2 = 60/100
Moles of top gas = moles of $CO$ + moles of $CO_2$ + moles of N2
Moles of N2 = (moles of top gas - moles of $CO$ - moles of $CO_2$) / 0.6
Moles of top gas = 3 / 0.22 + 17.25 / 0.18
Moles of top gas = 13.64 + 95.83 = 109.47 mol (approximately)

We know that the molar volume of an ideal gas at NTP is 22.4 L/mol.

Volume of the top gas = moles of top gas * molar volume
Volume of the top gas = 109.47 mol * 22.4 L/mol = 2452.1 L (approximately)

Since 1 m^3 = 1000 L,

Volume of the top gas (rounded off to the nearest integer) = 2452.1 L / 1000 = 2.45 m^3 (approximately)

Therefore, the volume of the blast furnace top gas is approximately 2.45 m^3.

The correct answer is [2.45].
