Let's first draw a diagram to visualize the situation:

```

Here, the rod is represented by the vertical line on the right, and the wall is represented by the vertical line on the left. The distance between the rod and the wall is 30 cm, and the length of the rod is 50 cm. We need to find the instantaneous velocity of the top of the rod when the bottom of the rod is pulled away from the wall at 4 cm/s.

Let's call the distance between the top of the rod and the wall "x". We can see from the diagram that the length of the rod "L" is equal to the sum of the distances "x" and 30 cm:

L = x + 30

We can also see that the top of the rod is sliding down the wall, so its velocity has both a horizontal and a vertical component. Let's call the horizontal component "v" (which is the 4 cm/s velocity at which the bottom of the rod is being pulled), and let's call the vertical component "u". We want to find the magnitude of the velocity, which is the hypotenuse of the triangle formed by the horizontal and vertical components.

We can use similar triangles to find an equation for "u" in terms of "x". The two triangles we're interested in are:

1. The big triangle formed by the rod, the wall, and the ground.
2. The small triangle formed by the part of the rod that's sliding down the wall, the vertical distance "x", and the horizontal distance that the top of the rod has moved.

The two triangles are similar because they both have a right angle, and their angles are the same (due to the parallel lines). Therefore, their corresponding sides are proportional. We can set up the following equation:

u / (50 - x) = x / 30

We can solve for "u" by cross-multiplying:

u = (50 - x) * x / 30

Now we can find the magnitude of the velocity by using the Pythagorean theorem:

magnitude of velocity = sqrt(v^2 + u^2)

Substituting the values we have:

magnitude of velocity = sqrt(4^2 + [(50 - x) * x / 30]^2)

We want to find the value of "x" that maximizes this expression, because that's when the magnitude of the velocity will be the highest. To do this, we can take the derivative of the expression with respect to "x", set it equal to 0, and solve for "x".

After solving, we get:

x = 15 sqrt(10)

Substituting this value back into the expression for the magnitude of the velocity, we get:

magnitude of velocity = 8 cm/s (rounded to two decimal places)

Therefore, the correct answer is:

- 8 cm/s
