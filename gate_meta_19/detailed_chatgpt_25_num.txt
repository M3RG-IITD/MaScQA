Given: 
- Width of plate = 100 cm 
- Initial thickness of plate = 5 cm 
- Final thickness of plate = 3 cm 
- Entry velocity = 10 cm/s 

We can use the principle of conservation of mass to find the exit velocity of the plate. According to this principle, the mass of the material entering the rolling process must be equal to the mass exiting the rolling process. 

Let's assume that the length of the plate remains constant during the rolling process. The volume of the plate can be expressed as: 

$V = L \cdot W \cdot t$

where 
- $V$ is the volume of the plate 
- $L$ is the length of the plate (constant) 
- $W$ is the width of the plate (constant) 
- $t$ is the thickness of the plate 

Using the given dimensions, the initial volume of the plate is: 

$V_{initial} = L \cdot 100 \cdot 5$ 

The final volume of the plate is: 

$V_{final} = L \cdot 100 \cdot 3$ 

Since the mass of the plate remains constant, the initial and final masses must be equal. The density of the material is given as: 

$\rho = \frac{m}{V}$ 

where $\rho$ is the density, $m$ is the mass, and $V$ is the volume. 

Since the mass is constant, we can equate the initial and final densities as: 

$\rho_{initial} = \rho_{final}$ 

$\frac{m}{V_{initial}} = \frac{m}{V_{final}}$ 

Solving for $m$: 

$m = \rho \cdot V_{initial}$ 

$m = \rho \cdot L \cdot 100 \cdot 5$ 

$m = \rho \cdot L \cdot 500$ 

$m = \rho \cdot 500L$ 

where $L$ is the length of the plate. 

Now, let's consider the velocity of the plate. The mass flow rate can be expressed as: 

$\dot{m} = \rho \cdot V \cdot v$ 

where 
- $\dot{m}$ is the mass flow rate 
- $\rho$ is the density of the material 
- $V$ is the volume flow rate 
- $v$ is the velocity of the material 

The volume flow rate can be expressed as: 

$V = W \cdot t \cdot v$ 

Substituting this into the previous equation: 

$\dot{m} = \rho \cdot W \cdot t \cdot v^2$ 

Since the mass flow rate is constant: 

$\dot{m}_{initial} = \dot{m}_{final}$ 

$\rho \cdot W \cdot 5 \cdot 10 = \rho \cdot W \cdot 3 \cdot v_{final}^2$ 

Solving for $v_{final}$: 

$v_{final} = \sqrt{\frac{5}{3}} \cdot 10$ 

$v_{final} \approx 12.9$ cm/s 

Therefore, the exit velocity of the plate is approximately 12.9 cm/s. 

Answer: 
- 12.9 cm/s
