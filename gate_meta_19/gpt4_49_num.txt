We cannot see the image showing how the material is loaded. However, we can provide the solution for the two cases of loading, parallel and perpendicular to the layers.

Case 1: Loading parallel to the layers (isostrain situation):
In the isostrain situation, the elastic modulus of the composite material E_c is given by the rule of mixtures:
E_c = V_A * E_A + V_B * E_B

Where V_A and V_B are the volume fractions of A and B, and E_A and E_B are the elastic moduli of A and B.

Given, E_A = 200 GPa, E_B = 100 GPa, and the volume fraction of B (V_B) = 0.25. Therefore, the volume fraction of A (V_A) = 1 - V_B = 0.75.

E_c = 0.75 * 200 GPa + 0.25 * 100 GPa
E_c = 150 GPa + 25 GPa
E_c = 175 GPa (parallel)

Case 2: Loading perpendicular to the layers (isostress situation):
In the isostress situation, the elastic modulus of the composite material E_c is given by:
1/E_c = V_A/E_A + V_B/E_B

1/E_c = 0.75/200 GPa + 0.25/100 GPa
1/E_c = 0.00375 GPa^(-1) + 0.0025 GPa^(-1)
1/E_c = 0.00625 GPa^(-1)

E_c = 1 / 0.00625 GPa^(-1)
E_c = 160 GPa (perpendicular)

Depending on the loading condition, the elastic modulus of the material will be either 175 GPa (parallel) or 160 GPa (perpendicular). Please clarify the loading condition to provide a more specific answer.

Final answer: [175, 160]
