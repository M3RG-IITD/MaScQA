Let's break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. Determine the moles of Iron, Oxygen and Carbon required to produce 1 Metric ton of liquid iron:

Given that, Liquid iron produced contains 3.6 wt.% carbon. So, in 1000 kg (1 metric ton) liquid iron, the iron content is (1 - 0.036) * 1000 = 964 kg $Fe$ and Carbon content is 36 kg $C$.

Now, we know hematite contains 90 wt.% $Fe_(2)O_(3)$. So, to get 964 kg of iron, we need:
964 kg $Fe$ × $\frac{1\ mol\ Fe_{2}O_{3}}{2\ mol\ Fe}$ × $\frac{159.69\ g}{1\ mol\ Fe_{2}O_{3}}$ = 1398.31 kg $Fe_{2}O_{3}$

Next, to produce 1 metric ton of liquid iron, the coke charged is 500 kg, which contains 90 wt.% carbon. So, the actual carbon input is 500 × 0.9 = 450 kg $C$.

2. Determine the blast furnace top gas composition in moles:

Let the moles of $CO$, $CO_{2}$ and $N_{2}$ in blast furnace top gas be $x, y$ and $z$ respectively. Then, CO = $22\% x$, $CO_{2} = 18\% y$, and $N_{2} = 100\% - 22\% - 18\% = 60\% z$.

3. Perform the stoichiometry balance based on the reactions taking place:

The main reactions taking place are:
a. $Fe2O3(s)\ +\ 3C(s)\ \to\ 2Fe(l)\ +\ 3CO(g)$
b. $C(s)\ +\ O2(g)\ \to\ CO2(g)$
c. $2N2(g)$ (inert)

Now, let's balance the reactions:
a. Iron: $2\ mol\ Fe\ \to\ 1\ mol\ Fe_{2}O_{3}\$
b. Oxygen: $3\ mol\ O \to\ 1\ mol\ Fe_{2}O_{3}$

For 1 metric ton (1000 kg) of liquid iron production, the moles of each species are:
$Fe: 964\ kg\ \times\ \frac{1\ mol\ Fe}{55.85\ g} = 17256\ mol$
$Fe_{2}O_{3}: 1398.31\ kg\ \times\ \frac{1 \ mol \ Fe_{2}O_{3}}{159.69\ g} = 8757\ mol$
$O: 8757\ mol \ Fe_{2}O_{3} \times\frac{3 \ mol \ O}{1 \ mol \ Fe_{2}O_{3}} = 26271\ mol$
$CO2: 36\ kg\ C\ \times\ \frac{1\ mol\ CO_{2}}{12\ g\ C} = 3000\ mol$

Stoichiometry gives the following mole balances:
$x = 26271\ mol\ CO$
$y = 3000\ mol\ CO_{2}$
$z = \frac{6000 - 22x - 18y}{60} = \frac{6000 - 22(26271) - 18(3000)}{60}  = 21319\ mol \ N_2$

4. Calculate the volume of the blast furnace top gas:

The molar volume of the gas at NTP is 22.4 L/mol. The total volume of the top gas is:
$Volume\ of\ top\ gas = (x+y+z) \times 22.4 \ L/mol$
$Volume\ of\ top\ gas = (26271+3000+21319) \times 22.4 \ L/mol$

Now, we need to convert the volume from liters to cubic meters:
$Volume\ of\ top\ gas = (26271+3000+21319) \times \frac{22.4\ L}{1\ mol\ \times\ 1000\ L/m^3} = 1105.31\ m^3$

Finally, rounding off to the nearest integer, we have:

$Volume\ of\ top\ gas \approx 1105\ m^3$ (NTP)

So, the volume of the blast furnace top gas is approximately 1105 cubic meters at NTP.

The correct answer is [1105].
