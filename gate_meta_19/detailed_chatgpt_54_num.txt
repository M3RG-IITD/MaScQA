We can start by using the formula for rolling force:

𝐹 = 𝑓 × 𝑁 × 𝑏

where 𝐹 is the rolling force, 𝑓 is the coefficient of friction, 𝑁 is the normal force, and 𝑏 is the width of the contact area between the roll and the slab.

To find 𝑁, we can consider the equilibrium of forces on the slab. If we assume that the slab is initially at rest and neglect any external forces (such as gravity), then the horizontal force due to friction must be balanced by the force due to deformation of the slab. This force can be calculated using the formula for stress:

𝜎 = 𝐹 ÷ 𝐴

where 𝜎 is the stress, 𝐹 is the force, and 𝐴 is the cross-sectional area of the slab.

Assuming that the slab is uniform and rectangular in shape, we can express its cross-sectional area as:

𝐴 = 𝑡 × 𝑏

where 𝑡 is the thickness of the slab.

Substituting these expressions into the formula for stress, we get:

𝜎 = 𝑓 × 𝑁 ÷ 𝑡 × 𝑏

Rearranging this equation for 𝑁, we get:

𝑁 = (𝜎 × 𝑡 × 𝑏) ÷ 𝑓

Now, we can substitute the values given in the problem. Let's assume a stress of 100 MPa (which is reasonable for mild steel). Then:

𝑁 = (100 × 10^6 Pa × 0.1 m × 0.2 m) ÷ 0.2

𝑁 = 1 × 10^6 N

This is the normal force between the roll and the slab. To find the rolling force, we can substitute into the formula given earlier. Let's also assume a conservative value for the width of the contact area (say, 50 mm):

𝐹 = 0.2 × 1 × 10^6 N × 0.05 m

𝐹 = 10^4 N

Finally, we can use the formula for torque to find the maximum possible reduction in thickness:

𝜏 = 𝐹 × 𝑟

where 𝜏 is the torque and 𝑟 is the radius of the roll (which is half the diameter).

Substituting values, we get:

𝜏 = 10^4 N × 0.1 m

𝜏 = 1000 Nm

The linear displacement of the slab is given by the formula:

𝜃 = Δ𝑥 ÷ 𝑟

where 𝜃 is the angular displacement of the roll (in radians) and Δ𝑥 is the linear displacement of the slab (in meters).

Solving for Δ𝑥, we get:

Δ𝑥 = 𝜃 × 𝑟

The maximum possible reduction in thickness occurs when the roll completes one full rotation (i.e., when 𝜃 = 2𝜋). Therefore:

Δ𝑥 = 2𝜋 × 0.1 m

Δ𝑥 ≈ 0.628 m

To find the reduction in thickness, we need to subtract the final thickness from the initial thickness:

𝛥𝑡 = 0.1 m - 0.628 m

𝛥𝑡 ≈ -0.528 m (note that the thickness has decreased)

Finally, we round off the answer to one decimal place:

-0.5 mm

Therefore, the maximum possible reduction in thickness (rounded off to one decimal place) is -0.5 mm (i.e., a decrease of half a millimeter).
