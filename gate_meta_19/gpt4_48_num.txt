Using the nucleation theory equation, we can find the critical radius (r*) of nickel nucleus during solidification:

r* = (2 * σ) / (ΔH * (1 - T/Tm))

Where:
σ = Liquid-solid interfacial energy = 0.5 𝐽.$𝑚^(−2)$
ΔH = Enthalpy of fusion of nickel = 2.65 × 10^9 𝐽.$𝑚^(−3)$
T = Temperature during solidification = 1673 K
Tm = Equilibrium melting temperature of nickel = 1728 K

r* = (2 * 0.5) / (2.65 × 10^9 * (1 - 1673/1728))
r* = 1 / (2.65 × 10^9 * 0.0318)
r* = 1 / 8.417 × 10^7 𝑚

To convert the radius to nanometers, we multiply by 10^9:

r* = (1 / 8.417 × 10^7) * 10^9
r* ≈ 118.8 nm

The critical radius of the nickel nucleus during solidification at 1673 K is approximately [118.8] nm (rounded to one decimal place).
