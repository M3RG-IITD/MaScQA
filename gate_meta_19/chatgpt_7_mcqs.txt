By Buckingham Π theorem, the number of independent dimensionless variables needed to describe the phenomenon is:

n = (number of variables) - (number of fundamental dimensions)

In this case, we have 4 variables (d, W, µ, and ρ) and 3 fundamental dimensions (length, mass, and time). Therefore,

n = 4 - 3 = 1

So the answer is (A) 1.
