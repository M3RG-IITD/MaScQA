The correct answer is (C) van der Waals bonds.

Explanation:

A hydrogen bond is a type of attractive intermolecular force that occurs between a hydrogen atom bonded to a highly electronegative atom such as nitrogen, oxygen, or fluorine and another nearby electronegative atom. Hydrogen bonds are relatively weak in comparison to most types of chemical bonds, but they play an important role in many chemical and biochemical reactions.

Ionic bonds are chemical bonds that form between atoms that have gained or lost electrons. In an ionic bond, one atom becomes positively charged (cation) while the other becomes negatively charged (anion), and the two oppositely charged ions attract each other. Ionic bonds tend to be strong.

Metallic bonds occur between metal atoms and involve the sharing of free electrons among a lattice of positively charged metal ions. They tend to be strong and are responsible for the unique properties of metals.

Covalent bonds occur when atoms share one or more pairs of electrons. Covalent bonds can be strong or weak, depending on the types of atoms involved and the number of shared electrons.

Van der Waals forces are the weakest among the four types of bonds. Van der Waals forces are relatively weak forces that occur between non-polar molecules. These forces arise due to the fluctuations in electron density within the molecules, which can cause temporary dipoles that attract neighboring molecules.
