The given differential equation is: 

$$\frac{d}{dr}\left(r\frac{dT}{dr}\right)=0$$

We need to find the rate of heat loss per unit length through the outer surface of the cylinder. Let's use Fourier's law of heat conduction:

$$\frac{dQ}{dt}=-kA\frac{dT}{dx}$$

where $dQ/dt$ is the rate of heat transfer per unit time, $k$ is the thermal conductivity, A is the surface area through which heat is transferred, and $dT/dx$ is the temperature gradient in the direction of heat transfer.

Since the cylinder is infinitely long, we can assume that heat transfer occurs only in the radial direction. Thus, the surface area A is the lateral surface area of the cylinder: 

$$A=2\pi rh$$

where $h$ is the height of the cylinder. Since the cylinder is hollow, we have:

$$h=\text{outer radius}-\text{inner radius}=0.07-0.05=0.02\text{ m}$$

Also, the temperature gradient $dT/dx$ can be expressed in terms of the temperature gradient in the radial direction using the chain rule:

$$\frac{dT}{dx}=\frac{dT}{dr}\cdot\frac{dr}{dx}=-\frac{dT}{dr}$$

since $dr/dx=1$ for radial distances.

Let's integrate the differential equation to obtain a general solution:

$$r\frac{dT}{dr}=C_1$$

where $C_1$ is a constant of integration. Integrating again gives:

$$T=C_1\ln r+C_2$$

where $C_2$ is another constant of integration.

Using the boundary conditions, we can solve for the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$. At the inner surface ($r=0.05$ m), the temperature is 1473 K. Thus:

$$1473=C_2$$

At the outer surface ($r=0.07$ m), the temperature is 973 K. Using the general solution:

$$973=C_1\ln 0.07+1473$$

Solving for $C_1$ gives:

$$C_1=\frac{973-1473}{\ln (0.07/0.05)}=-504.4\text{ K/m}$$

Now we can calculate the rate of heat loss per unit length through the outer surface of the cylinder. Using Fourier's law with $x=r$ and $A=2\pi rh$, we get:

$$\frac{dQ}{dt}=-kA\frac{dT}{dx}=2\pi khr\frac{dT}{dr}=-2\pi krC_1$$

The minus sign indicates that heat is flowing outwards from the cylinder. Evaluating this expression at $r=0.07$ gives:

$$\frac{dQ}{dt}|_{r=0.07}=-2\pi (2)\cdot 0.07\cdot (504.4)\cdot (2)=\boxed{-226.5\text{ W/m}}$$

Therefore, the rate of heat loss per unit length through the outer surface of the hollow cylinder is approximately -227 W/m.
