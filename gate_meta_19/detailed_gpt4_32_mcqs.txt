To determine which slip system will be activated first, we need to find the one with the highest resolved shear stress along the slip direction on the slip plane. The resolved shear stress can be determined by the Schmid factor, which is given by the following equation: 

Schmid Factor = cos(θ) * cos(φ)

where θ is the angle between the tensile axis (in this case [1 -1 0]) and the slip direction, and φ is the angle between the tensile axis and slip plane normal. The slip system with the largest Schmid Factor will activate first.

Step 1: Calculate the normalized stress vector along the tensile axis:
The tensile axis is given as [1 -1 0]. To find the normalized stress vector, we must compute the length of the tensile axis vector, and then divide each component of the vector by its length.

Length of the tensile axis vector = √(1² + (-1)² + 0²) = √2
Normalized stress vector = [1/√2, -1/√2, 0]

Step 2: Calculate the Schmid Factors for each slip system:

(A) (1 -1 -1)[0 -1 1]
Slip direction = [0 -1 1]
Slip plane normal = [1 -1 -1]

Cosine of the angle between the stress vector and slip direction:
cos(θ) = (stress_vector • slip_direction) / (||stress_vector|| ||slip_direction||)
cos(θ) = [(1/√2 * 0) + (-1/√2 * -1) + (0 * 1)] / (√2 * √2) = 1/2

Cosine of the angle between the stress vector and slip plane normal:
cos(φ) = (stress_vector • slip_plane_normal) / (||stress_vector|| ||slip_plane_normal||)
cos(φ) = [(1/√2 * 1) + (-1/√2 * -1) + (0 * -1)] / (√2 * √3) = √(2/6)

Schmid factor for (A) = cos(θ) * cos(φ) = 1/2 * √(2/6) = √(1/6)

(B) (-1 -1 1)[011]
Slip direction = [0 1 1]
Slip plane normal = [-1 -1 1]

cos(θ) = [(1/√2* 0) + (-1/√2 * 1) + (0 * 1)] / (√2*√2) = -1/2
cos(φ) = [(1/√2 * -1) + (-1/√2 * -1) + (0 * 1)] / (√2 * √3) = √(2/6)

Schmid factor for (B) = cos(θ) * cos(φ) = -1/2 * √(2/6) = -√(1/6)

(C) (-1 -1 1)[1 -1 0]
Slip direction = [1 -1 0]
Slip plane normal = [-1 -1 1]

cos(θ) = [(1/√2* 1) + (-1/√2 * -1) + (0 * 0)] / (√2*√2) = 1
cos(φ) = [(1/√2 * -1) + (-1/√2 * -1) + (0 * 1)] / (√2 * √3) = √(2/6)

Schmid factor for (C) = cos(θ) * cos(φ) = 1 * √(2/6) = √(2/3)

(D) (-1 -1 1)[101]
Slip direction = [1 0 1]
Slip plane normal = [-1 -1 1]

cos(θ) = [(1/√2* 1) + (-1/√2 * 0) + (0 * 1)] / (√2*√2) = 1/2
cos(φ) = [(1/√2 * -1) + (-1/√2 * -1) + (0 * 1)] / (√2 * √3) = √(2/6)

Schmid factor for (D) = cos(θ) * cos(φ) = 1/2 * √(2/6) = √(1/6)

Step 3: Identify the slip system with the highest Schmid factor:

Comparing the Schmid factors of each slip system:
(A) √(1/6)
(B) -√(1/6)
(C) √(2/3)
(D) √(1/6)

Slip system (C) has the highest Schmid factor, so it will be activated first.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) (-1 -1 1)[1 -1 0].
