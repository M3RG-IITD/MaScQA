The fracture strength of a material is inversely proportional to the length of any crack present in that material. Therefore, we can write:

$\sigma \propto \frac{1}{c}$

where $\sigma$ is the fracture strength and $c$ is the length of the crack.

Taking the ratio of the fracture strengths of the two samples, we get:

$\frac{\sigma_1}{\sigma_2} \propto \frac{1}{c_1} \cdot \frac{c_2}{1}$

Plugging in the values of $c_1$ and $c_2$, we get:

$\frac{\sigma_1}{\sigma_2} \propto \frac{1}{0.5} \cdot \frac{2}{1} = 4$

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 4.0.
