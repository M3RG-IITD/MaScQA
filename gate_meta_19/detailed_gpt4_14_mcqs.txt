A) Ionic bonds: Ionic bonds occur between a metal and a non-metal element. The metal gives away one or more electrons to the non-metal, which increases the stability of both elements. These bonds are formed due to the electrostatic attraction between the positively charged metal and negatively charged non-metal ions. They are strong and usually have high melting and boiling points.

B) Metallic bonds: Metallic bonds are formed between metal atoms. In a metallic bond, electrons are shared between many atoms, creating a "sea" of electrons. These bonds are responsible for the conductive properties of metals and their malleability. They have intermediate strength, typically not as strong as covalent or ionic bonds but stronger than van der Waals bonds.

C) Van der Waals bonds: Van der Waals bonds (also known as London dispersion forces, named after the scientist who discovered them) are weak electrostatic forces that occur between neutral molecules due to the constant fluctuation of electron distribution within the molecule. These bonds are the weakest of the four bond types.

D) Covalent bonds: Covalent bonds form when two non-metal atoms share electrons, creating a stable valence shell for each atom involved. Covalent bonds can be single, double, or triple, depending on the number of electrons shared between the atoms. These bonds are strong and usually have high melting and boiling points. 

Hydrogen bonds are a type of intermolecular force, which occur between molecules rather than within them. They are strong dipole-dipole interactions that arise between an electronegative atom (usually oxygen, nitrogen, or fluorine) and a hydrogen atom covalently bonded to another electronegative atom. While hydrogen bonds are strong compared to other intermolecular forces, they are typically weaker than ionic and covalent bonds but stronger than van der Waals bonds.

Hence the correct answer is:
