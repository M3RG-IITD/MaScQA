To find the rate of heat loss per unit length through the outer surface of the hollow cylinder, we'll first solve the given equation for the temperature distribution T(r).

The equation for steady-state radial heat conduction in the hollow cylinder is:

$T''(r) + \frac{1}{r}T'(r) = 0$

Let's assume a solution of the form: 

T(r) = C1 * ln(r) + C2

Now differentiate T(r) with respect to r:

T'(r) = C1 * 1/r

Differentiate this again with respect to r:

T''(r) = -C1 * 1/r^2

Plugging T'(r) and T''(r) back into the original ODE, we get:

-C1 * 1/r^2 + (1/r) * C1 * 1/r = 0

Simplifying:

-C1 * 1/r^2 + C1 * 1/r^2 = 0

This verifies that our assumed solution form is correct. Now we'll use the boundary conditions to find C1 and C2.

Boundary conditions:
T(0.05) = 1473 K (inner surface temperature)
T(0.07) = 973 K (outer surface temperature)

Plugging these boundary conditions into our assumed solution:

1473 = C1 * ln(0.05) + C2  (1)
973 = C1 * ln(0.07) + C2   (2)

Solve this system of equations for C1 and C2. From (1) - (2):

500 = C1 * (ln(0.05) - ln(0.07))

This gives us:

C1 ≈ 1809.49

Now plug C1 back into (1) or (2) to solve for C2:

1473 = 1809.49 * ln(0.05) + C2

This gives us:

C2 ≈ 3681.38

Now we have the temperature distribution T(r) = 1809.49 * ln(r) + 3681.38.

The rate of heat loss per unit length, Q (in W/m), through the outer surface of the hollow cylinder can be found using Fourier's law:

Q = -k * A * T'(r)

For the outer surface (r = 0.07 m), A = 2π * 0.07 (area per unit length), and T'(0.07) = 1809.49 * 1/0.07:

Q = -2 * 2π * 0.07 * (1809.49 * 1/0.07)

Q ≈ -516.45 W/m

But since we need the absolute value of the heat loss rate, which is positive:

Q = 516.45 W/m (rounded off to the nearest integer)

So, the rate of heat loss per unit length through the outer surface of the hollow cylinder is approximately [516] W/m.
