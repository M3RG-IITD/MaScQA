We know that the Griffith theory of brittle fracture states that the critical stress required for the propagation of a crack is given by:

$\sigma _c = \frac{E}{\sqrt{2\pi a}}$

Where $\sigma_c$ is the critical stress for propagation of the crack, $E$ is the modulus of elasticity, and $a$ is the length of the crack.

Taking the ratio of the two critical stresses, we get:

$\frac{\sigma_1}{\sigma_2} = \frac{E}{\sqrt{2\pi c_1}}\cdot\frac{\sqrt{2\pi c_2}}{E}$

Simplifying, we get:

$\frac{\sigma_1}{\sigma_2} = \sqrt{\frac{c_2}{c_1}}$

Substituting the given values, we get:

$\frac{\sigma_1}{\sigma_2} = \sqrt{\frac{2\text{ mm}}{0.5\text{ mm}}} = \sqrt{4} = 2$

Therefore, the ratio of the fracture strength of the two samples is 2, and the answer is (C) 2.0.
