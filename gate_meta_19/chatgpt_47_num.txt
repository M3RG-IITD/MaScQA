The stored energy per unit volume, $ùëà$, can be calculated using the formula:

$$U = \frac{1}{2} \mu b^2 \rho$$

where $\mu$ is the shear modulus, $b$ is the Burgers vector length, and $\rho$ is the dislocation density.

Substituting the given values, we get:

$$U = \frac{1}{2} \times 82 \times 10^9 \times \left(\frac{0.2856 \times 10^{-9}}{2\sqrt{3}}\right)^2 \times (10^{15}-10^{10})$$

Simplifying this expression, we get:

$$U \approx 9.3 \, \text{MJ} \, \text{m}^{-3}$$

Rounding off to one decimal place, we get the final answer:

- The associated stored energy is approximately 9.3 MJ m^-3.
