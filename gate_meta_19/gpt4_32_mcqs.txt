To determine which slip system will be activated first, we calculate the Schmid factor (SF) for each slip system. The Highest Schmid Factor will correspond to the slip system that will be activated first. 

The Schmid factor formula for a specific slip system is:

SF = abs(Load direction • Slip direction * Load direction • Normal)

where "Load direction" is the applied stress direction [1 -1 0], "Slip direction" is the direction of slip (the slip directions in the given options) and "Normal" is the normal to the slip plane (the plane normals in the given options).

Now let's find the Schmid factor for each system:

(A) (1 -1 -1)[0 -1 1]
SF = abs([1 -1 0] • [0 -1 1] * [1 -1 0] • [1 -1 -1])
SF = abs(1 * 2)
SF = 2

(B) (-1 -1 1)[011]
SF = abs([1 -1 0] • [0 1 1] * [1 -1 0] • [-1 -1 1])
SF = abs(-1 * 2)
SF = 2 

(C) (-1 -1 1)[1 -1 0]
SF = abs([1 -1 0] • [1 -1 0] * [1 -1 0] • [-1 -1 1])
SF = abs(2 * 0)
SF = 0

(D) (-1 -1 1)[101]
SF = abs([1 -1 0] • [1 0 1] * [1 -1 0] • [-1 -1 1])
SF = abs(1 * 2)
SF = 2

From the calculated Schmid factors, slip system (C) has the highest Schmid factor (SF=2) and, therefore, will be activated first.

Answer: [(C) (-1 -1 1)[1 -1 0]]
