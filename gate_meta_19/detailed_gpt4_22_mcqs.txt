Alligatoring is a defect that occurs during the processing of metals, specifically in sheet metal forming operations. It is a surface defect that appears as a pattern of cracks or fissures on the surface of the metal, resembling the skin of an alligator. This can be caused by various factors such as improper processing techniques, poor quality materials, or unequal cooling rates.

Now, let's analyze each of the options:

(A) Extrusion: 
Extrusion is a process used to create objects of a fixed cross-sectional profile by pushing a material through a die with the desired shape. While defects may occur in the extrusion process, alligatoring is not common in this manufacturing process.

(B) Deep drawing: 
Deep drawing is a sheet metal forming process in which a sheet metal blank is drawn into a forming die by the mechanical action of a punch. The sheet metal is stretched and bent around the punch and die, forming the desired shape. Alligatoring can occur in this process, as it directly involves sheet metal forming.

(C) Sheet metal forming: 
Sheet metal forming refers to the broader category of processes that involve shaping or forming metal sheets. This can include stretching, bending, or drawing the metal into various shapes. As mentioned earlier, alligatoring is a defect that is commonly found in sheet metal forming operations.

(D) Rolling: 
Rolling is a metalworking process that involves passing the material between two rollers to reduce its thickness or make the material's thickness uniform. Although defects can occur in rolling, such as surface crack and internal voids, alligatoring is not typically associated with the rolling process.

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is (C) Sheet metal forming. Alligatoring is a defect commonly observed in sheet metal forming operations due to the various factors that can lead to the formation of these surface cracks and fissures.

Answer: [C]
