To match the injection metallurgy techniques in Column I with the corresponding objectives in Column II, we need to understand each technique's purpose first.

(P) Aluminium wire feeding:
This technique is used for deoxidation in steelmaking. Aluminium reacts with the oxygen present in the liquid steel, forming solid aluminium oxide (Al2O3) particles, which then float to the surface and are removed as slag. So, P matches with 4.

(Q) Calcium treatment:
Calcium treatment is used for inclusion modification in steelmaking. It allows for the formation of oxide-sulfide inclusions, which are more deformable and have lower melting temperatures, thereby improving the castability and reducing nozzle clogging. So, Q matches with 1.

(R) Argon rinsing:
Argon rinsing, also known as argon bubbling, is used to homogenize the temperature and chemical composition of the liquid steel by stirring it. This improves the quality of the final product. So, R matches with 2.

(S) Lime powder injection:
Lime powder injection, also known as Lime (CaO) injection, is primarily used for de-sulphurization in steelmaking. Lime reacts with sulphur in the liquid steel, forming calcium sulfide (CaS) which then floats to the surface and is removed as slag. So, S matches with 3.

Therefore, our matches are:
P-4, Q-1, R-2, S-3

The correct answer is (D), which is written inside a list: [P-4, Q-1, R-2, S-3].
