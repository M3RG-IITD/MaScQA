Let's consider the following diagram:

```
              |
              |
              |
              |
              |
              |
              |
      (top of rod)
              |
              |
              |
              |
              |
              |
              |
            -----
          /      \
    (bottom of   (distance from wall
       rod)         is 30 cm)
```

Let's call $x$ the distance from the wall that the bottom of the rod has been pulled, like so:

```
              |
              |
              |
              |
              |
              |
              |
      (top of rod)
              |
              |
              |
              |
              |
              |
              |
            -----
          /<--x   \
    (bottom of   (distance from wall
       rod)         is 30 cm)
```

Since the rod is 50 cm long, the height of the top of the rod is $50 - x$. Let's call $h$ the distance between the bottom of the rod and the top of the rod along the wall, like so:

```
              |
              |
              |
              |
              |
              |
              |
      (top of rod)
              |
              |
              | h
              |
              |
              |
              |
            -----
          /<--x   \
    (bottom of   (distance from wall
       rod)         is 30 cm)
```

By similar triangles, we have:

$$\frac{h}{50 - x} = \frac{30}{x}$$

Simplifying:

$$hx = (50 - x)(30)$$

$$hx = 1500 - 30x$$

Taking the derivative with respect to time $t$:

$$\frac{d}{dt}(hx) = \frac{d}{dt}(1500 - 30x)$$

$$h\frac{dx}{dt} + x\frac{dh}{dt} = -30\frac{dx}{dt}$$

We want to find $\frac{dh}{dt}$ when $\frac{dx}{dt} = 4 \text{ cm}^{-1}$:

$$h(4) + x\frac{dh}{dt} = -30(4)$$

$$\frac{dh}{dt} = -\frac{4h}{x}$$

Using the equation we found before for $hx$:

$$\frac{dh}{dt} = -\frac{4(1500-30x)}{x^2}$$

Substituting $x = 30 + 4t$ (since we know that $\frac{dx}{dt} = 4 \text{ cm}^{-1}$):

$$\frac{dh}{dt} = -\frac{4(1500 - 30(30 + 4t))}{(30 + 4t)^2}$$

Simplifying:

$$\frac{dh}{dt} = -\frac{480}{(30 + 4t)^2}$$

Plugging in $t = 0$ (since we want the instantaneous velocity when the bottom of the rod is 30 cm away from the wall):

$$\frac{dh}{dt} = -\frac{480}{(30)^2} = -\frac{4}{3} \text{ cm}^{-1}$$

But we want the magnitude of the instantaneous velocity, so we take the absolute value:

$$\left|\frac{dh}{dt}\right| = \frac{4}{3} \text{ cm}^{-1}$$

Therefore, the magnitude of the instantaneous velocity of the top of the rod is $\frac{4}{3}$ cm/s. 

Answer: 
- $\frac{4}{3}$ cm/s
