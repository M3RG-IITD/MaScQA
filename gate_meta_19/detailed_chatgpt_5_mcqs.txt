The equilibrium established in this scenario is the equilibrium between liquid steel and graphite. At this equilibrium state, the chemical potential of carbon in the liquid steel phase should be equal to the chemical potential of carbon in the graphite phase. This can be expressed by the following equation:

μ(C in liquid) = μ(C in graphite)

where μ is the chemical potential.

Assuming the standard state for graphite, the activity (a) of carbon in graphite is defined as:

a(C in graphite) = 1

Since liquid steel is not the standard state, we cannot directly calculate its activity. Instead, we can use the concept of activity coefficient (γ) to relate the activity of carbon in liquid steel (a(C in liquid)) to the activity of carbon in graphite:

a(C in liquid) = γ(C in liquid) × a(C in graphite)

At equilibrium, we can assume that γ(C in liquid) is constant. Therefore, we can rewrite the equilibrium equation as:

μ(C in liquid) = μ(C in graphite)
RT ln γ(C in liquid) + μ°(C in liquid) = μ°(C in graphite)
RT ln γ(C in liquid) = -ΔG°(reaction)

where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, ΔG°(reaction) is the standard free energy change for the reaction, and μ° is the chemical potential in the standard state.

For the reaction to reach equilibrium, ΔG°(reaction) must be zero. This implies that:

RT ln γ(C in liquid) = 0
ln γ(C in liquid) = 0
γ(C in liquid) = 1

Therefore, we can conclude that at equilibrium, the activity of carbon in liquid steel is the same as the activity of carbon in graphite, which is 1.0.
