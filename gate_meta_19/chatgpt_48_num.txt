The critical radius (𝑟*) is given by the expression:

𝑟* = 2𝛴/((𝜆𝛼)Δ𝑇)

where 𝛴 is the liquid-solid interfacial energy, 𝜆 is the enthalpy of fusion, 𝑎 is the atomic radius of nickel, and Δ𝑇 is the degree of undercooling.

The atomic radius of nickel is not given in the question, but we can use an approximate value of 0.124 nm.

First, we need to find the degree of undercooling:

Δ𝑇 = 𝑇𝑚 − 𝑇

where 𝑇 is the actual temperature and 𝑇𝑚 is the equilibrium melting temperature.

Δ𝑇 = 1728 K - 1673 K = 55 K

Substituting the given values into the expression for 𝑟*, we get:

𝑟* = 2 × 0.5 𝐽. $𝑚^{−2}$ /((2.65 × $10^9$ 𝐽.$𝑚^{−3}$ ) × (0.124 × $10^{−9}$ 𝑚) × 55 K) 

𝑟* = 8.6 nm

Therefore, the critical radius of nickel nucleus during solidification at 1673 K is 8.6 nm (rounded off to one decimal place).

Answer: [8.6]
