This question requires the use of a formula to calculate the reduction in thickness of the slab during rolling. One such formula is:

𝑑2 = (𝑑1 – 𝑑1 × 𝜇 × 𝜋)2

Where:
- 𝑑1 = initial diameter of the slab
- 𝑑2 = final diameter of the slab after rolling
- 𝜇 = coefficient of friction between roll and slab
- 𝜋 = 3.14 (approximate value of pi)

Substituting the given values:

𝑑1 = 100 mm (since the slab is initially 100 mm thick)
𝑑2 = ?
𝜇 = 0.2
𝑑1 = 200 mm (since the roll diameter is 200 mm)
𝜋 = 3.14

𝑑2 = (100 – 100 × 0.2 × 3.14)2
𝑑2 = (100 – 62.8)2
𝑑2 = 37.2

Rounding off to one decimal place, the maximum possible reduction in thickness of the slab during rolling is 37.2 mm.

Therefore, the answer is:
- 37.2 mm
