To answer this question, we need to understand each of the terms (BOF, LF, VD, and CC) and their roles in steelmaking operations.

1. BOF (Basic Oxygen Furnace): This is the first stage in the steelmaking process. The BOF is a large vessel where molten iron (from the blast furnace) is combined with scrap metal and fluxes (to remove impurities). Oxygen is then blown into the mixture, which reacts with the impurities and generates heat to melt the scrap and produce liquid steel.

2. LF (Ladle Furnace): After the BOF process, the liquid steel is poured into a ladle for secondary refining. The Ladle Furnace is an electric furnace where the steel temperature is adjusted and additional alloy elements are added to achieve the desired chemistry. This step also involves the removal of more impurities from the steel.

3. VD (Vacuum Degassing): Vacuum Degassing is an optional treatment applied to the liquid steel to remove dissolved gases such as hydrogen and nitrogen, which can cause defects in the finished product. A vacuum is created in a sealed chamber around the ladle, allowing the gases to be drawn out. This improves the steel quality and can result in better mechanical properties.

4. CC (Continuous Casting): Finally, the liquid steel is cast into semi-finished forms (like billets, blooms, or slabs) in the continuous casting process. This involves pouring the steel into a water-cooled mold, which solidifies the steel into a strand. The strand is then cut into suitable lengths for further processing, such as rolling or forging.

Now let's rearrange the steps in the correct sequence of steelmaking operations:

1. BOF (Basic Oxygen Furnace)
2. LF (Ladle Furnace)
3. VD (Vacuum Degassing)
4. CC (Continuous Casting)

Comparing this sequence with the given options, we find that:

A) BOF → LF → VD → CC matches our derived sequence.

So the correct answer is:
