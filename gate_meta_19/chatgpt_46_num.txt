First, we need to calculate the amount of copper (in moles) present in the 100 metric ton concentrate.

100 metric ton = 100000 kg

The weight of copper present in the concentrate = 21% of 100000 kg = 21000 kg

Now, we can calculate the moles of copper present:

Moles of Cu = (21000 kg) / (atomic weight of Cu)

Moles of Cu = (21000 kg) / (63 g/mol) = 333.33 mol

During electrolysis, one mole of copper requires two electrons, and Faraday’s constant represents the charge carried by one mole of electrons. Therefore, the total charge required for depositing 333.33 moles of copper can be calculated as:

Q = 2 × 96500 × 333.33 coulombs

Q = 6.41 × 10^10 coulombs

Now, we need to calculate the amount of time required to process the concentrate:

Number of working hours in 6 months = 25 days/month × 8 hours/day × 6 months = 1200 hours

Number of cells arranged in series = 10

The minimum current rating required would be the total charge divided by the total processing time and the number of cells in series:

Minimum current rating = (Q / t) / number of cells arranged in series

Minimum current rating = (6.41 × 10^10 C) / (1200 hours × 10 cells)

Minimum current rating = 5.34 × 10^5 A

Rounded off to the nearest integer, the minimum current rating per month per cell is 534000 A.

Answer: [534000]
