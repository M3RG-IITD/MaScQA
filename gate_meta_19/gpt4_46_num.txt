First, let's determine the total amount of copper in the concentrate:

100 metric tons * 21 wt.% = 21 metric tons of copper

Now, let's convert the copper amount into grams:

21 metric tons * (1000 kg/metric ton) * (1000 g/kg) = 21,000,000 grams of copper

Let's calculate the number of gram equivalents of copper:

21,000,000 grams / 63 (atomic weight) = 333,333.33 gram equivalents

We need to determine the total number of working hours in 6 months:

6 months * 25 days/month * 8 hours/day = 1200 hours

Now, let's calculate the number of ampere hours needed:

333,333.33 gram equivalents * 96500 Coulombs = 32,166,666,165 Coulombs

Now, let's divide this by the total number of hours and the number of cells to get the current rating per cell per month:

32,166,666,165 Coulombs / 1200 hours / 10 cells = 2,680,555.51 Coulombs/month/cell

Since 1 Ampere = 1 Coulomb/second, and there are 3600 seconds in an hour, let's convert this to Ampere per month per cell:

2,680,555.51 Coulombs/month/cell * 1 month / (3600*25*60) seconds/month = 1493.64 A

Now, let's round this off to the nearest integer to find the minimum current rating:

Minimum Current Rating = 1494 A

The minimum current rating per month per cell is 1494 Ampere.

Answer: [1494]
