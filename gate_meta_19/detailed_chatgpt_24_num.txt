First, we can use the formula for Bragg's Law to find the spacing between the (111) planes:

$$
d_{111} = \frac{\lambda}{2\sin(\theta)} 
$$

where $d_{111}$ is the spacing between the (111) planes, $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the X-rays, and $\theta$ is the Bragg angle. Substituting the given values, we get:

$$
d_{111} = \frac{\lambda}{2\sin(21.68^\circ)} 
$$

Now, for a FCC crystal, the (111) planes form a cube with edge length equal to $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$ times the length of the unit cell edge. Thus, we have:

$$
d_{111} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}a
$$

where $a$ is the lattice parameter. Substituting the given value of $a$, we get:

$$
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}(0.3615 \text{ nm}) = \frac{\lambda}{2\sin(21.68^\circ)} 
$$

Solving for $\lambda$, we get:

$$
\lambda = 0.154 \text{ nm}
$$

Therefore, the wavelength of the X-rays is 0.154 nm. 

Answer: [0.154]
