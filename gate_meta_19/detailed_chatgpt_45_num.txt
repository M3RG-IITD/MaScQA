First, we need to calculate the amount of iron produced in Metric ton (MT). Let's assume that we charge 100 MT of hematite containing 90 wt.% $Fe_2O_3$ in the blast furnace. That means we have 90 MT of $Fe_2O_3$. 

To calculate the amount of oxygen required to reduce $Fe_2O_3$: 

1 mol $Fe_2O_3$ reacts with 3 mol CO to produce 2 mol Fe and 3 mol CO$_2$. 

So, 160 g $Fe_2O_3$ reacts with 3 x 28 g CO to produce 2 x 56 g Fe and 3 x 44 g CO$_2$. 

Molar mass of $Fe_2O_3$ = 160 g/mol

Molar mass of CO = 28 g/mol 

Amount of $Fe_2O_3$ = 90,000 kg / 160 g/mol = 562.5 mol

Amount of CO required = 3 x 562.5 = 1687.5 mol

Amount of oxygen required = 1687.5 mol / 2 = 843.75 mol

Volume of oxygen at NTP = 843.75 x 22.4 = 18,900 L


Now, let's calculate the amount of coke required to produce this much CO: 

Amount of coke required = (1687.5 / 1000) x 500,000 = 843,750 kg


Next, let's calculate the amount of CO and $CO_2$ produced: 

Amount of CO produced = 22/100 x 18,900 = 4,158 L

Amount of $CO_2$ produced = 18/100 x 18,900 = 3,402 L 


Total volume of blast furnace top gas produced = 4,158 + 3,402 = 7,560 L 

Rounding off to the nearest integer, the volume of blast furnace top gas produced is 7,560 $m^3$ (NTP). 

Therefore, the correct answer is: 
- 7560 (rounded off to the nearest integer)
