To find the maximum possible reduction of a thick slab during rolling, we first need to calculate the maximum draught, which is the maximum possible reduction in thickness of the material. The following steps will help us to calculate this.

Step 1: Find the angle of bite (α)
The angle of bite (α) is the angle between the roll and the slab as the slab enters the roll gap. This is determined by the following equation:

tan(α) = Coefficient of friction (μ)
α = arctan(μ)

Given, Coefficient of friction (μ) = 0.2

α = arctan(0.2)
α ≈ 11.31°

Step 2: Calculate the roll radius (R)
Since we are given the roll diameter (200 mm), we'll first convert it into radius by dividing by 2.

Roll diameter = 200 mm
Roll radius (R) = Diameter / 2
R = 200 / 2
R = 100 mm

Step 3: Calculate the roll-gap contact length (L)
The roll-gap contact length is the distance along the arc of the roll where the slab is in contact with the roll.

L = R * sin(α)

L = 100 * sin(11.31°)
L ≈ 19.84 mm

Step 4: Calculate the maximum draught (Δh_max)
The maximum draught is given by the following equation:

Δh_max = R * (1 - cos(α))

Δh_max = 100 * (1 - cos(11.31°))
Δh_max ≈ 10.92 mm

Step 5: Round off the maximum draught value
Round off Δh_max to one decimal place:

Δh_max = 10.9 mm

So, the maximum possible reduction of a 100 mm thick slab during rolling is 10.9 mm.
