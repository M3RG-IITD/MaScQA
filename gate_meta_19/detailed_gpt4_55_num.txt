Step 1: Understand the problem statement
The problem statement provides us with the parameters of an arc welding process: current (400 Amperes), voltage (20 V), traverse speed (5 mm/s), and heat transfer efficiency (0.6). We are asked to find the energy input per unit length (in J/mm, rounded off to the nearest integer) during the arc welding process.

Step 2: Calculate the power input
We know that power input for a given process can be calculated using the formula:

Power (P) = Voltage (V) * Current (I)

Given, voltage (V) = 20 V and current (I) = 400 Amperes,

Power (P) = 20 V * 400 A = 8000 W (Watts)

Step 3: Calculate the effective power
Given the heat transfer efficiency of the process as 0.6, the effective power (the actual power that is utilized in welding) can be calculated as:

Effective power (P_eff) = Power (P) * Heat transfer efficiency

P_eff = 8000 W * 0.6 = 4800 W (Watts)

Step 4: Calculate the energy input per unit length
We know that energy (E) can be calculated using the formula:

Energy (E) = Power (P) * Time (t)

Since we have to find the energy input per unit length, we need to calculate the time required to traverse a unit length. Given the traverse speed (v) as 5 mm/s, the time required (t) to traverse 1 mm can be calculated as:

Time (t) = 1 mm / 5 mm/s = 1/5 s = 0.2 s

Now, we can calculate the energy input per unit length:

Energy (E) = Effective power (P_eff) * Time (t)

E = 4800 W * 0.2 s = 960 J (Joules)

Step 5: Round off the answer to the nearest integer
Energy input per unit length = 960 J/mm (rounded to the nearest integer)

Therefore, the energy input per unit length during the arc welding process is [960].
