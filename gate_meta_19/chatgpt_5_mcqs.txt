The activity of a component in a solution is equal to its mole fraction only at an infinitesimally low concentration of the solution. Therefore, generally, the activity of a component is not equal to its mole fraction in a solution. 

In the present case, liquid steel is a solution of iron and carbon. When liquid steel is kept in a graphite crucible for long enough time, equilibrium will be established between the iron-carbon solution and graphite crucible. At equilibrium, the activity of carbon in the liquid will be equal to the activity of carbon in graphite, which is unity by definition.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(C) 1.0
