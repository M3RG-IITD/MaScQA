First, we need to calculate the amount of copper in the concentrate:

100 metric tons x 0.21 = 21 metric tons Cu

Next, we need to calculate the moles of Cu:

21,000 kg / 63 g/mol = 333.33 moles Cu

Since there are 10 cells arranged in series, each cell will operate at a voltage of about 1 volt to give a total of 10 volts. We can use this information to calculate the total amount of charge needed to deposit all the copper:

Total charge = 333.33 moles x 2 (to account for 2 electrons per Cu ion) x 96500 C/mol = 6.43 x 10^10 C

Next, we can find the amount of charge required per month by dividing the total charge by the number of months of operation:

6.43 x 10^10 C / 6 months = 1.07 x 10^10 C/month

Finally, we can find the amount of current needed per cell per month by dividing the amount of charge by the product of the number of cells, number of working days per month, and number of working hours per day:

Current = 1.07 x 10^10 C/month / (10 cells x 25 days/month x 8 hours/day x 3600 s/hour) = 1245 A/month/cell

Rounding off to the nearest integer, the minimum current rating required is 1245 A/month/cell.

Answer:
- 1245 A/month/cell
