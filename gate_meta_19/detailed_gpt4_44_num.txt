To find the volumetric flow rate of gas per unit area through the bed, we can use Darcy's law, which is given by:

Q = -k * (ΔP / L) * (A / η)

Where:
- Q is the volumetric flow rate per unit area (m³/s)
- k is the permeability of the bed (m^4/N*s)
- ΔP is the pressure drop across the bed (Pa)
- L is the bed height (m)
- A is the cross-sectional area of the bed (m²)
- η is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid (Pa*s)

We're given the following information:

- Pressure drop in the granular zone of a blast furnace is 300 mm of water per meter of the bed height.
- The bed permeability is 0.8 𝑚^(4).𝑁^(−1).𝑠^(−1)
- Density of water = 1000 𝑘𝑔.𝑚^(−3)
- g = 9.8 𝑚. 𝑠^(−2)

First, we need to convert the pressure drop from mm of water to Pascal (Pa). To do that, we can use the following equation:

ΔP = ρ * g * h

Where:
- ρ is the density of water (1000 kg/m³)
- g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s²)
- h is the pressure drop in water (m)

The pressure drop is given as 300 mm of water, or 0.3 m. Therefore,

ΔP = 1000 kg/m³ * 9.8 m/s² * 0.3 m = 2940 Pa

Now, we can plug the given values into Darcy's law:

Q = -0.8 𝑚^(4).𝑁^(−1).𝑠^(−1) * (2940 Pa / 1 m) * (1 m² / η)

Since the problem doesn't provide the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, we cannot directly calculate the volumetric flow rate of gas per unit area. However, upon closer examination, we can notice that the volumetric flow rate per unit area is asked in the units $(𝑚^(3).𝑠^(−1)).𝑚^(−2)$, which doesn't require the viscosity in the calculation.

Thus, we can rewrite Darcy's law as follows:

Q = -k * (ΔP / L)

Now, we can plug in the given values:

Q = -0.8 𝑚^(4).𝑁^(−1).𝑠^(−1) * (2940 Pa / 1 m)

Q ≈ -2352 𝑚^(3).𝑠^(−1).𝑚^(−2)

Since the flow rate cannot be negative, we can take the absolute value to get:

Q ≈ 2352 𝑚^(3).𝑠^(−1).𝑚^(−2)

Rounded off to the nearest integer, the volumetric flow rate of gas per unit area through the bed is approximately 2352 $(𝑚^(3).𝑠^(−1)).𝑚^(−2)$.

The final answer is [2352].
