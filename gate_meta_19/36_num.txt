A 50 cm long rod is placed against a vertical wall such that the bottom of the rod is 30 cm away from the wall. If the bottom of the rod is pulled horizontally away from the wall at 4 𝑐𝑚. $𝑠^(−1)$ , the top of the rod starts sliding down the wall with an instantaneous velocity (in 𝑐𝑚. $𝑠^(−1)$ , rounded off to two decimal places) of magnitude is?
