Assume Darcy’s law is applicable and g = 9.8 𝑚. $𝑠^(−2)$. Density of water = 1000 𝑘𝑔.$𝑚^(−3)$. Pressure drop in the granular zone of a blast furnace is 300 mm of water per meter of the bed height. The bed permeability is 0.8 $𝑚^(4).𝑁^(−1).𝑠^(−1)$ . The volumetric flow rate of gas per unit area through the bed [in $(𝑚^(3).𝑠^(−1)).𝑚^(−2)$ , rounded off to the nearest integer] is
