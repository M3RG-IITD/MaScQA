We will first convert the pressure drop from mm of water to Pa. 

To do that, we will use the following formula:

Pressure drop (Pa) = pressure drop (mm of water) * g * density of water

Pressure drop (Pa) = (300 mm * 0.001 m/mm) * 9.8 m/s² * 1000 kg/m³
Pressure drop (Pa) = 2.94 * 10^3 Pa/m 

Now, we will use Darcy's law to find the volumetric flow rate of gas per unit area through the bed.

Darcy's law is given by:

Q/A = -k * (ΔP/Δh)

Where Q/A is the volumetric flow rate of gas per unit area (m³/s.m²), k is the bed permeability (0.8 m⁴/N.s), and ΔP/Δh is the pressure drop per meter of the bed height (2.94 * 10^3 Pa/m).

Plugging in the values, we get:

Q/A = -0.8 * (-2.94 * 10^3)
Q/A = 0.8 * 2.94 * 10^3
Q/A = 2.352 * 10^3 (m³/s.m²)

Rounding off to the nearest integer, the volumetric flow rate of gas per unit area through the bed is approximately:

Q/A ≈ 2352 m³/s.m²

So, the correct answer is [2352].
