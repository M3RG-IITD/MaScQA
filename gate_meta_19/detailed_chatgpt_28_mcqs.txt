Unfortunately, the image mentioned in the question is not provided. However, we can provide the necessary information to determine the correct answer based on crystal structures:

In a FCC structure:
- Each unit cell has 4 atoms.
- The coordination number is 12.
- The packing fraction is 0.74.

In a BCC structure:
- Each unit cell has 2 atoms.
- The coordination number is 8.
- The packing fraction is 0.68.

In a DC structure:
- Each unit cell has 8 atoms.
- The coordination number is 4.
- The packing fraction is 0.34.

Using this information, we can determine the correct answer based on the given options.
