The correct phase transformations and corresponding reactions are as follows:

- Peritectic (P): L + α → β (Column II - 4)
- Monotectic (Q): L1 → L2 + α (Column II - 3)
- Eutectoid (R): γ → α + β (Column II - 1)
- Syntectic (S): L1 + L2 → α (Column II - 2)

So the correct answer is (A) P-4, Q-3, R-1, S-2.
