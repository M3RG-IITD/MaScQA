The solidification time for a casting depends on its volume and surface area to volume ratio. 

For a cube-shaped casting with volume 27 $cm^3$, each side has length $27^{1/3} \approx 3.3$ cm. The surface area is then $6\times(3.3\times 3.3) = 65.16$ $cm^2$. The surface area to volume ratio is $\frac{65.16}{27} \approx 2.42$ $cm^{-1}$.

For a cylinder-shaped casting with radius 1 cm and height 6 cm, the volume is $\pi\times(1^2)\times 6 = 18.85$ $cm^3$. The surface area is $2\pi\times 1 \times 6 + 2\pi\times(1^2) = 20.85$ $cm^2$. The surface area to volume ratio is $\frac{20.85}{18.85} \approx 1.11$ $cm^{-1}$.

According to the Chvorinov's rule, the total solidification time is proportional to the volume times the surface area to volume ratio raised to the power of $n$. The value of $n$ depends on the shape and size of the casting, and typically ranges from 1 to 3.

Let's assume that $n=2$ for both the cube-shaped and cylinder-shaped castings. Then we have:

Solidification time for the cube-shaped casting = $180 \times 27\times 2.42^2 \approx 6859$ seconds

Solidification time for the cylinder-shaped casting = $180 \times 18.85\times 1.11^2 \approx 4429$ seconds

Therefore, the correct answer is:

- 4429 seconds.
