According to the Griffith's theory, for a brittle material such as glass, the fracture occurs when the stress at the crack tip exceeds the materialâ€™s fracture strength. The fracture strength is related to the size of the internal cracks as:

$\sigma \propto 1/\sqrt{c}$

where $\sigma$ is the fracture strength and $c$ is the crack size. Now, let's compare the ratio of fracture strengths for two samples:

$\frac{\sigma_1}{\sigma_2} = \frac{1/\sqrt{c_1}}{1/\sqrt{c_2}}$

Substitute $c_1$ = 0.5 mm and $c_2$ = 2 mm:

$\frac{\sigma_1}{\sigma_2} = \frac{1/\sqrt{0.5}}{1/\sqrt{2}}$

Now, we can simplify the equation by finding the square roots and reciprocal values:

$\frac{\sigma_1}{\sigma_2} = \frac{1/\sqrt{0.5}}{1/\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{0.5}}$

Now we can rationalize the denominator by multiplying both numerator and denominator by $\sqrt{2}$

$\frac{\sigma_1}{\sigma_2} = \frac{\sqrt{2}*\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{0.5}*\sqrt{2}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{1}} = \frac{2}{1} = 2$

So, the ratio of the fracture strength of the two samples is 2, which is option (C). Therefore, the correct answer is [C].
