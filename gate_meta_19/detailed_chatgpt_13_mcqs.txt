The diffusivity of elements in a metal depends on several factors like temperature, crystal structure, and size of the diffusing atoms. The diffusivity (D) can be expressed by the following equation:

D = Do * exp(-Q/RT)

where Do is the pre-exponential or frequency factor, Q is the activation energy for diffusion, R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature. 

At high temperatures, the diffusivity of atoms in iron increases exponentially. Therefore, the fastest diffusing element in iron at 1100°C would be the one with the highest diffusivity.

We can compare the values of Q/RT of the elements to determine their relative diffusivity. 

For Ni:
Q/RT = (250 * 10^3 J/mol) / (8.31 J/mol-K * 1373 K) ≈ 0.19

For Co:
Q/RT = (322 * 10^3 J/mol) / (8.31 J/mol-K * 1373 K) ≈ 0.25

For Cr:
Q/RT = (528 * 10^3 J/mol) / (8.31 J/mol-K * 1373 K) ≈ 0.39

For C:
Q/RT = (91 * 10^3 J/mol) / (8.31 J/mol-K * 1373 K) ≈ 0.07

The element with the lowest value of Q/RT would have the highest diffusivity. So, in this case, Carbon (C) has the lowest Q/RT and would be the fastest diffusing element in Iron at 1100°C.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

- (D) C
