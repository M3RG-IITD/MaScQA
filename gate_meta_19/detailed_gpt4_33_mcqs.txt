Unfortunately, I cannot see the image as I am an AI language model and am unable to process visual information. However, I can still guide you through the process of constructing a Mohr's circle given stress components, and you may compare the constructed circle with your image options.

To draw Mohr's circle for a stress state, you'll need the components of stress: normal stress components (σx, σy), and the shear stress components (τxy, τyx). In most cases, τxy = τyx.

Step 1:
Calculate the center of Mohr's circle:
The center of the circle is represented as the point (C), with coordinates given by:
C = ((σx + σy) / 2, 0)

Step 2:
Calculate the radius of Mohr's circle:
The radius (R) of Mohr's circle is given by:
R = sqrt[((σx - σy) / 2)^2 + τxy^2]

Step 3:
Construct Mohr's circle:
With the center of the circle (C) and the radius (R), you can now draw Mohr's circle. The circle will be centered at C (the x-coordinate represents the average normal stress) and extend both in positive and negative directions along the y-axis, representing positive and negative shear stresses.

Step 4:
Determine the principal stresses and maximum shear stress:
Mohr's circle provides information regarding the principal stresses (σmax, σmin) and maximum shear stresses (τmax).

The principal stresses, σmax and σmin, are the maximum and minimum normal stresses (when shear stress is 0) on the circle, and can be found by using the radius and center of the circle. 

σmax = C + R
σmin = C - R

The maximum shear stress, τmax, is equal to the radius, 'R'.

Now, compare the Mohr's circle you have drawn with the image's options and find which one resembles the circle you have constructed.

The correct answer would be inside the list.
