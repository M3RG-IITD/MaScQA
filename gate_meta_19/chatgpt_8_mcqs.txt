The limiting current density can be calculated using the following formula:

𝐼_𝑙𝑖𝑚=(𝑛𝐹𝐴𝐶)/{𝑉(1+𝜆)}
where,
n = number of electrons involved in the reaction, n = 2 for copper electrodeposition
A = electrode area, taken as 1 cm^2
C = concentration of the copper ion in the solution
V = volume of the solution, taken as 100 ml = 0.1 L
𝜆 =  mass transfer coefficient

Substituting the given values, we get:

𝐼_𝑙𝑖𝑚= [(2)(96500 𝐶𝑜𝑢𝑙𝑜𝑚𝑏 𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑚 𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑡)(1 cm^2)(0.5 * 10^(−3) mol/cm^3)]/{(0.1 L)(1 + 10^(−4) cm/s)}

𝐼_𝑙𝑖𝑚 = 9.65 𝑚𝐴/cm^2

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 9.65. 

Answer: 
- (B) 9.65
