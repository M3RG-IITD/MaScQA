Since there's no image provided, I'll provide you with the information about the crystal structures, coordination numbers and packing fractions. You can then determine which option matches with the correct information.

1. FCC (Face centered cubic)
   CN: 12
   PF: 0.74 (74%)

2. BCC (Body centered cubic)
   CN: 8
   PF: 0.68 (68%)

3. DC (Diamond cubic)
   CN: 4
   PF: 0.34 (34%)

Now you can compare these values with the options given in the image and choose the correct one. Please provide the image or a description of the options if you need further assistance in identifying the correct option.
