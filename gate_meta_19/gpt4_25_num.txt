To solve this problem, we can use the principle of volume conservation. The volume of the plate before and after rolling is the same, so:

Initial width * Initial thickness = Final width * Final thickness

Assuming no change in width, we have:

100 cm * 5 cm = 100 cm * 3 cm

Initial volume = Final volume

Now, let's consider the velocities of the plate entering and exiting the rolling process. Since the volume is conserved, the product of the cross-sectional area and the velocity should be the same before and after the process.

Initial area * Initial velocity = Final area * Final velocity

(100 cm * 5 cm) * 10 cm/s = (100 cm * 3 cm) * Final velocity

500 cm²/s = 300 cm² * Final velocity

Now, solve for the final velocity:

Final velocity = 500 cm²/s / 300 cm²
Final velocity = 5/3 cm/s ≈ 1.7 cm/s (rounded off to one decimal place)

So, the exit velocity of the plate is approximately 1.7 cm/s.
