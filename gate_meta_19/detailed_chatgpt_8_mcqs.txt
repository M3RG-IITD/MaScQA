Given, 
Faraday constant, $𝐹 = 96500 𝐶𝑜𝑢𝑙𝑜𝑚𝑏 𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑚 𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑡$ 
The transport of reactant is the rate-limiting step, and the mass transfer coefficient is $10^{−4}$ $𝑐𝑚.𝑠^{−1}$. 
The concentration of 𝐶uSO4 is given as 0.5 × $10^{−3}$ $𝑚𝑜𝑙.𝑐𝑚^{−3}$.
We can use the limiting current density equation for electrodeposition, which is given as: 

$$𝑖_L = \frac{{nFAC}}{t}$$

where, 
n = number of electrons 
A = electrode area 
C = concentration 
t = time

The number of electrons for copper deposition can be found from the reaction, 
Cu$^{2+}$ + 2e$^{-}$ → Cu

Here, the number of electrons involved is 2. 

The time for deposition can be calculated using the relation, 

$$𝑖_L = 0.95i_m$$

$$𝑖_L = \frac{{nFAC}}{t}$$

$$t = \frac{{nFA}}{0.95i_mC}$$

Here $0.95i_m$ is taken as the limiting current density.

Substituting the given values in the equation, 
 
$$t = \frac{{2×96500×1×10^{−4}}}{0.95×9.65×0.5×10^{−3}} $$

$$t = 40.95\ s$$

The limiting current density is given by, 

$$i_L = \frac{{nFAC}}{t}$$

$$i_L = \frac{{2×96500×1×10^{−4}×0.5×10^{-3}}} {40.95}$$

$$i_L = 4.83\ mA/cm^2$$

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 4.83.
