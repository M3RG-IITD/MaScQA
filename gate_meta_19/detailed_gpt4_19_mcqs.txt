To solve this problem, we'll use the concept of fracture mechanics.

Fracture strength is inversely proportional to the square root of the crack length, according to the Griffith's criterion for brittle fracture. Mathematically, this can be written as:

$$
\sigma \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{c}}
$$

Where $\sigma$ is the fracture strength and $c$ is the length of the internal crack.

We are given that the crack length in two samples is $c_1 = 0.5$ mm and $c_2 = 2$ mm. We need to find the ratio of the fracture strength of these samples: $\frac{\sigma_1}{\sigma_2}$.

Using the proportionality relation:

$$
\sigma_1 \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{c_1}} \quad \text{and} \quad \sigma_2 \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{c_2}}
$$

Divide these two equations to find the ratio of the fracture strengths:

$$
\frac{\sigma_1}{\sigma_2} = \frac{1/\sqrt{c_1}}{1/\sqrt{c_2}}
$$

Plug in the given values for $c_1$ and $c_2$:

$$
\frac{\sigma_1}{\sigma_2} = \frac{1/\sqrt{0.5}}{1/\sqrt{2}}
$$

Now, find the square root of each value:

$$
\frac{\sigma_1}{\sigma_2} = \frac{1/0.7071}{1/1.4142}
$$

Divide the numerators and invert the denominators:

$$
\frac{\sigma_1}{\sigma_2} = \frac{0.7071}{1} * \frac{1.4142}{1} = 0.7071 * 1.4142
$$

Multiply these values together:

$$
\frac{\sigma_1}{\sigma_2} = 1.0000
$$

This value corresponds to option (B) 1.0, which is the correct answer. Therefore, the ratio of the fracture strength of the two samples is 1.0.

Final answer: (B) 1.0

Note that due to some approximation in intermediate steps, the final value might appear at first close to 1 but not exactly 1. However, given that the other options (A, C, and D) have values sufficiently different from 1 (0.5, 2, and 4), it is clear that option B (1.0) is the closest and correct option.
