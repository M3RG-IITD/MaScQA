A) Creep Test:
A creep test is a procedure in which a material is subjected to a constant stress over an extended period of time at a constant temperature, and the resulting deformation or strain is measured. The primary focus is on understanding how a material deforms under prolonged exposure to stress, especially at high temperatures. Beach marks are not usually found following a creep test because it is more associated with fatigue failure rather than a single loading event.

B) Fatigue Test:
A fatigue test is a method used to determine the ability of a material to withstand cyclic loading â€“ repeated loading and unloading. This test simulates how a part will behave under normal use, which often involves repeated cycles of stress. Fatigue failure is typically characterized by crack initiation and growth, eventually leading to fractures. Beach marks or "fatigue striations" are characteristic features of fatigue failure observed as concentric lines on the fracture surface. These marks are formed due to the incremental advancement of a fatigue crack across localized regions during each load cycle.

C) Impact Test:
An impact test aims to study the behavior of materials subjected to sudden forces or stresses, such as a hammer blow or a drop-weight test. These tests are meant to evaluate the toughness, brittleness or impact strength of a material. Beach marks are generally not observed on the fractured surfaces in impact tests, as these fractures are caused by a single loading event rather than repeated cycles.

D) Compression Test:
A compression test is a procedure where a material is subjected to a compressive force and its behavior under this force is studied. This test assesses the material's ability to withstand compressive loads and determines its compressive strength and stiffness. Beach marks are not observed in compression tests, since the fractures are the result of direct compressive force and not cyclical loading.

Conclusion:
Out of the four given test types, beach marks are most commonly observed on the fractured surfaces of metals from a fatigue test. This is because beach marks specifically denote the incremental growth of a crack under cyclic loading, which is only observed during fatigue tests.
