The correct answer is (C) secondary electron and back-scatter electron, respectively.

Explanation:

In a typical SEM, a beam of primary electrons is focused on the sample. When the primary electron beam interacts with the sample, many different types of electrons are generated, including secondary electrons and back-scattered electrons.

Secondary electrons are low-energy electrons that are ejected from the surface of the sample as a result of the interaction with the primary electron beam. These electrons are collected by a detector and used to produce a topographical image of the sample surface.

Back-scattered electrons, on the other hand, are high-energy electrons that are scattered back towards the detector from within the sample. They carry information about the atomic number and composition of the sample, and are used to produce an image with atomic contrast. 

Therefore, in a typical SEM image, information about topography and atomic contrast are obtained from the secondary electron and back-scatter electron, respectively.
