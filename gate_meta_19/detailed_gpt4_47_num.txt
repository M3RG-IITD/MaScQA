We are given the following information:

Shear modulus of iron (G) = 82 GPa
Burger's vector (b) = a/2[1 1 1], a = 0.2856 nm
Increase in dislocation density (Δρ) from 10^10 to 10^15 m^(-2)

We want to find the stored energy (U) associated with this increase in dislocation density.

The formula for the stored energy per unit volume due to dislocations is given by:

$U = \dfrac{1}{2} Gb^2 Δρ$

First, let's convert the given units for the Burgers vector and Shear modulus to be consistent with the dislocation density.

The Burger's vector, b = a/2[1 1 1], can be expressed as 
b = (a/2) * √(1² + 1² + 1²)

Since a = 0.2856 nm, we can convert that into meters:
a = 0.2856 * 10^(-9) m

Now, substitute the value of a into the Burger's vector equation:
b = (0.2856 * 10^(-9) m / 2) * √(1² + 1² + 1²) = 1.2344 * 10^(-10) m

Next, convert the shear modulus, 82 GPa, to pascals (Pa):
G = 82 * 10^9 Pa

Now, we can find the increase in dislocation density (Δρ):
Δρ = 10^15 m^(-2) - 10^10 m^(-2) = 9.99 * 10^14 m^(-2)

Now, substitute the values of G, b, and Δρ into the formula for stored energy:

U = (1/2) * (82 * 10^9 Pa) * (1.2344 * 10^(-10) m)^2 * (9.99 * 10^14 m^(-2))

U ≈ 6.3 * 10^5 J/m^3

Finally, we need to express the stored energy in MJ/m^3 (rounded off to one decimal place):

U = 6.3 * 10^5 J/m^3 * (1 MJ/10^6 J) = 0.63 MJ/m^3

Answer: The associated stored energy is [0.6] MJ/m^3 (rounded off to one decimal place).
