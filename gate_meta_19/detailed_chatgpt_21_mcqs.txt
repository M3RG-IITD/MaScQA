The most suitable non-destructive testing method for detecting small internal flaws in a dense bulk material is Ultrasonic inspection.

Explanation:

Ultrasonic inspection uses high-frequency sound waves to detect internal flaws in a material. The waves are sent through the material and the reflections of the waves are used to create an image of the interior of the material. This method is very sensitive and can detect very small flaws, even if they are deep inside the material. It is commonly used in industries like aerospace, automotive, and manufacturing to test for cracks, corrosion, and other types of damage. 

Dye penetrant method is used to detect flaws on the surface of a material, and it may not be effective for detecting internal flaws.

Eddy current testing is usually used for detecting surface defects like cracks, corrosion, and variations in material thickness, not internal flaws.

Magnetic particle inspection is used to detect surface and near-surface flaws in ferromagnetic materials.
