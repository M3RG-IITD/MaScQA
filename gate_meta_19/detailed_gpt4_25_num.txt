We can solve this problem by applying the principle of mass conservation. Since the width and thickness of the plate change but the mass remains constant, we have:
Initial width × Initial thickness × Initial velocity = Final width × Final thickness × Final velocity

Let:
Initial width (W1) = 100 cm
Initial thickness (T1) = 5 cm
Initial velocity (V1) = 10 cm/s
Final width (W2) = 100 cm (given that there is no change in the width)
Final thickness (T2) = 3 cm
Final velocity (V2) = ?

Now, we can apply the principle of mass conservation:

Initial width × Initial thickness × Initial velocity = Final width × Final thickness × Final velocity

W1 × T1 × V1 = W2 × T2 × V2

Plugging in the given values:

100 cm × 5 cm × 10 cm/s = 100 cm × 3 cm × V2

5000 cm^2/s = 300 cm^2 × V2

Now, we can solve for the final velocity (V2) by dividing both sides of the equation by 300 cm^2:

V2 = 5000 cm^2/s ÷ 300 cm^2

V2 ≈ 16.7 cm/s

So, the exit velocity of the plate is approximately 16.7 cm/s when rounded off to one decimal place.

Answer: [16.7]
