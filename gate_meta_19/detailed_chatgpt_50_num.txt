First, we need to find the corresponding point on the S-N curve for the given stress ratio of -0.8. 

Step 1: Identify the coordinates of the point (𝜎, N) where the curve intersects the 𝜎_(𝑚𝑎𝑥) line. 

- From the 𝜎_(𝑚𝑎𝑥) line, we draw a vertical line until it intersects the S-N curve. 
- From this point of intersection, we draw a horizontal line until it intersects the stress ratio line of -0.8. 

The coordinates of this point are approximately (375, 8000), as shown in the image below.

Step 2: Use the Goodman relation to calculate the maximum stress that the steel can withstand for infinite fatigue life. 

The Goodman relation is given by:

𝜎_(𝑚𝑎𝑥) = 𝜎_(𝑓) / (1 + (𝜎_(𝑓) / 𝜎_(𝑢)))

Where 𝜎_(𝑓) is the fatigue strength coefficient and 𝜎_(𝑢) is the ultimate tensile strength. Rearranging this equation, we can solve for 𝜎_(𝑓):

𝜎_(𝑓) = 𝜎_(𝑚𝑎𝑥) * (1 + (𝜎_(𝑓) / 𝜎_(𝑢)))

𝜎_(𝑓) - 𝜎_(𝑓) * 𝜎_(𝑚𝑎𝑥) / 𝜎_(𝑢) = 𝜎_(𝑚𝑎𝑥)

𝜎_(𝑓) = 𝜎_(𝑚𝑎𝑥) * 𝜎_(𝑢) / (𝜎_(𝑢) - 𝜎_(𝑚𝑎𝑥))

Substituting the values we have:

𝜎_(𝑓) = 375 * 1000 / (1000 - (-375))

𝜎_(𝑓) ≈ 545 MPa (rounded to the nearest integer)

Therefore, the maximum stress that the steel can withstand for infinite fatigue life is approximately 545 MPa. 

Answer: [545]
