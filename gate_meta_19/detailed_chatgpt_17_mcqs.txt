Tensile creep is a type of deformation that occurs under a constant tensile load, over a long period of time, at high temperatures. This type of creep is caused by several mechanisms, including Nabarro-Herring and Coble mechanisms. Now, we need to determine the conditions under which Nabarro-Herring mechanism is favored over Coble mechanism.

Nabarro-Herring mechanism is the dominant mechanism for creep when diffusion of vacancies is the rate-limiting step. This mechanism is favored when there is a significant concentration gradient of vacancies or when the grain size is larger, which means there are more grain boundaries for the atoms to diffuse through. 

On the other hand, Coble mechanism is the dominant mechanism for creep when grain boundary diffusion is the rate-limiting step. This mechanism is favored when the grain size is smaller and the temperature is higher, which means the atoms have more energy to diffuse through the grain boundaries.

Therefore, based on the above explanation, the correct answer is:
(C) larger grain size and higher temperature, as these conditions favor the Nabarro-Herring mechanism over the Coble mechanism.
