To minimize distortion after welding, we want the two blocks of metal to have similar properties, specifically, similar coefficients of thermal expansion. This will ensure that they expand and contract during heating and cooling at the same rate, leading to minimal distortion. Therefore, the best configuration for welding would be:

- Two blocks of the same metal
- The same thickness for both blocks
- The same orientation for both blocks (i.e. both blocks placed vertically or both placed horizontally)

This configuration will ensure that the two blocks will expand and contract at the same rate during welding and cooling, leading to minimal distortion.

Answer: 

The configuration that will undergo the least distortion after welding is:

- Two blocks of the same metal
- The same thickness for both blocks
- The same orientation for both blocks (i.e. both blocks placed vertically or both placed horizontally)
