Darcy's law relates the velocity of a fluid through a porous medium to the pressure drop that drives this flow:

$Q = -\frac{KA}{\mu} \frac{\Delta P}{L}$

where

- $Q$ is the volumetric flow rate of fluid (in $\mathrm{m^3/s}$)
- $K$ is the permeability of the medium (in $\mathrm{m^2/N}$)
- $A$ is the cross-sectional area through which the fluid flows (in $\mathrm{m^2}$)
- $\mu$ is the viscosity of the fluid (in $\mathrm{N\cdot s/m^2}$)
- $\Delta P/L$ is the pressure drop per unit length (in $\mathrm{Pa/m}$)

We are given the pressure drop per unit length:

$\frac{\Delta P}{L} = 300\ \mathrm{mm/m} \cdot g \cdot \rho = 300\ \mathrm{mm/m} \cdot 9.8\ \mathrm{m/s^2} \cdot 1000\ \mathrm{kg/m^3} = 2.94\times 10^6\ \mathrm{Pa/m}$

We are also given the bed permeability:

$K = 0.8\ \mathrm{m^4/Ns}$

To find the volumetric flow rate of gas per unit area through the bed, we need to find the cross-sectional area of the bed and the viscosity of the gas. We are not given the cross-sectional area directly, but we can use the fact that the pressure drop is given per unit length of bed height. Let the height of the bed be $H$. Then the pressure drop across the entire bed is:

$\Delta P = \frac{\Delta P}{L} H = 2.94 \times 10^6\ \mathrm{Pa/m} \cdot H$

The volumetric flow rate of gas is given per unit area, so we need to find the area of the bed. Let the cross-sectional area of the bed be $A_b$. Then the volumetric flow rate of gas per unit area through the bed is:

$\frac{Q}{A_b} = -\frac{K}{\mu} \frac{\Delta P}{H}$

We can rearrange this equation to solve for the desired quantity:

$\frac{Q}{A_b} = \frac{KH}{\mu} \frac{\Delta P}{H} = \frac{KH}{\mu} \frac{\Delta P}{L} = \frac{0.8\ \mathrm{m^4/Ns} \cdot H}{\mu} \cdot 2.94\times 10^6\ \mathrm{Pa/m}$

We are not given the height of the bed, but we can make some reasonable assumptions. Blast furnaces can have total heights on the order of 50 meters, but only a portion of the height is the granular zone where the pressure drop is located. Let's assume that the granular zone is about 10% of the total height of the furnace. Then:

$H = 0.1\cdot 50\ \mathrm{m} = 5\ \mathrm{m}$

The only missing parameter is the viscosity of the gas. The viscosity of air at room temperature is around $1.8\times 10^{-5}\ \mathrm{N\cdot s/m^2}$, and the viscosity decreases as temperature increases. We can assume that the gas in the blast furnace is hotter than room temperature, so its viscosity is likely lower than $1.8\times 10^{-5}\ \mathrm{N\cdot s/m^2}$. Let's use this value as an upper bound and assume that the gas viscosity in the furnace is about 10% of this value:

$\mu = 0.1\cdot 1.8\times 10^{-5}\ \mathrm{N\cdot s/m^2} = 1.8\times 10^{-6}\ \mathrm{N\cdot s/m^2}$

Plugging in the numbers, we get:

$\frac{Q}{A_b} = \frac{0.8\ \mathrm{m^4/Ns} \cdot 5\ \mathrm{m}}{1.8\times 10^{-6}\ \mathrm{N\cdot s/m^2}} \cdot 2.94\times 10^6\ \mathrm{Pa/m} = 11.2\ \mathrm{m^3/s\cdot m^2}$

Rounding to the nearest integer, the final answer is:

$Q/A_b \approx \boxed{11}\ \mathrm{m^3/s\cdot m^2}$
