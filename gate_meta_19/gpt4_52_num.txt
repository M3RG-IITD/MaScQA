We can use Chvorinov's rule to calculate the solidification time of the cylinder-shaped casting. The formula for this rule is:

$T = kV^2/A$ 

Where T is the solidification time, V is the volume of the casting, A is the surface area of the casting, and k is a constant representing the type of metal being used.

First, we need to find the constant (k) for the cube-shaped casting:

Given that the cube-shaped casting has a volume of 27 $cm^3$, and since it is a cube, all its sides are equal in length. Therefore, we have:

Side of the cube = $\sqrt[3]{27} = 3$ cm

The surface area of the cube is 6 times the area of one of the faces:

$A_{cube} = 6(side^2) = 6(3^2) = 54 cm^2$

So, the Chvorinov's rule for a cube is:

$T_{cube} = kV_{cube}^2/A_{cube} = 180$

Now, let's find the volume and surface area of the cylinder-shaped casting:

Given, radius = 1 cm, and height = 6 cm

$V_{cylinder} = πr^2h = π(1^2)(6) = 6π cm^3$

$A_{cylinder} = 2πrh + 2πr^2 = 2π(1)(6) + 2π(1^2) = 12π + 2π = 14π cm^2$

Now, we can use Chvorinov's rule for the cylinder:

$T_{cylinder} = kV_{cylinder}^2/A_{cylinder}$ 

We can find "k" from the cube casting equation above:

$k = (T_{cube}A_{cube}) / V_{cube}^2 = (180 × 54) / 27^2$

$k ≈ 1.254$

Now, we can plug the value of k into the equation for the cylinder:

$T_{cylinder} = (1.254)(6π)^2 / (14π)$ 

$T_{cylinder} ≈ 239.7$ seconds

So, the total solidification time for the cylinder-shaped casting, rounded off to one decimal place, is approximately 239.7 seconds.

The answer is [239.7].
