We can approach this problem using Bragg's Law, which relates the wavelength of X-rays, the angle of incidence or reflection (θ), the crystal lattice spacing (d), and the order of reflection (n). 

Step 1: Bragg's Law
The equation is given as:

n * λ = 2 * d * sin(θ),

where λ is the wavelength of X-rays, d is the lattice spacing for the corresponding crystal planes (in our case, (111) planes), and θ is the Bragg angle.

Step 2: Calculate the lattice spacing d
For an FCC crystal, the interplanar distance (d) between the (hkl) planes can be calculated using the lattice parameter (a) and the Miller indices (h, k, l). The formula is:

d_hkl = a / √(h^2 + k^2 + l^2),

For the (111) planes, h = 1, k = 1, and l = 1. The lattice parameter a is given as 0.3615 nm. Plugging these values, we get:

d_111 = 0.3615 / √(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) = 0.3615 / √3,

d_111 = 0.3615 / 1.732 ≈ 0.2086 nm

Step 3: Apply Bragg's Law to calculate the wavelength
Now we know our d_111 spacing, and we can plug this value into Bragg's Law equation using the given Bragg angle (θ) and assuming the order of reflection (n) to be 1:

1 * λ = 2 * 0.2086 * sin(21.68°),

λ = 2 * 0.2086 * sin(21.68°),

The sine value in degrees should be converted into radians:

sin(21.68°) = sin(21.68 * π / 180) = sin(0.37814) ≈ 0.3717

Now we can find the wavelength:

λ = 2 * 0.2086 * 0.3717 ≈ 0.1549 nm.

Rounded off to three decimal places, the wavelength of the X-rays is 0.155 nm.
