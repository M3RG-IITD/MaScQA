To determine the configuration that will undergo the least distortion after welding, we will consider the factors that can affect distortion in the welding process. Factors affecting distortion include:

1) Material properties
2) Joint design
3) The welding process
4) Welding heat input
5) Clamping and jigs
6) Preheating and post-welding heat treatment

Since both blocks are made of the same metal, factor 1 does not contribute to distortion differences in this case. 

Let's analyze the remaining factors, starting with joint design:

Joint designs can have a significant impact on the level of distortion in a welded joint. Some common joint designs include square butt, v-groove butt, lap, T, and edge joints, among others. Generally, configurations that have less restraint (less material preventing the welded region from expanding and contracting) and balanced heat input will experience less distortion. 

Thus, we will keep this in mind as we discuss the influence of the other factors:

2) The welding process: Different welding processes have different heat input and cooling rates, which can affect distortion. In this problem, we do not have information about the welding process, so we cannot make a conclusion based on this factor.

3) Welding heat input: For a given welding process, welding parameters like amperage, voltage, and travel speed can affect the amount of heat input. Less heat input and faster cooling rates will generally cause more distortion due to a greater temperature gradient, but this must be balanced with proper penetration and fusion. In this problem, we do not have information about welding parameters, so we cannot make a conclusion based on this factor.

4) Clamping and jigs: Proper clamping and using jigs can help reduce distortion by restraining the movement of the welded pieces during welding. In this problem, we do not have information about clamping or jigs, so we cannot make a conclusion based on this factor.

5) Preheating and post-welding heat treatment: Preheating can help reduce distortion by moderating the temperature gradient and reducing thermal stresses. Post-welding heat treatment can also be used to relieve residual stresses and further reduce distortion. In this problem, we do not have information about preheating or post-welding heat treatment, so we cannot make a conclusion based on this factor.

Due to the lack of specific information about the mentioned factors, we cannot provide a definitive answer to the problem. However, based on joint design considerations, configurations with less restraint and balanced heat input will undergo less distortion. A specific answer requires more information about the welding process, parameters, and conditions.

The correct answer could look like this, given more information:
