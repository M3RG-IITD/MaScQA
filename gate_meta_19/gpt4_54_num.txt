To find the maximum possible reduction during rolling, we'll have to use the coefficient of friction and the roll diameter.

The empirical formula for maximum reduction (R) during rolling is:
R = μ * (D / 2)

Where:
R = maximum possible reduction
μ = coefficient of friction between roll and slab
D = diameter of the roll

In this case, we're given:
μ = 0.2
D = 200 mm

Now, we can plug these values into the formula:
R = 0.2 * (200 / 2)

R = 0.2 * 100

R = 20 mm

The maximum possible reduction of a 100 mm thick slab during rolling is 20 mm. So the correct answer is [20].
