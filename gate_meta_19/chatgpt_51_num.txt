In order to find the true stress at necking, we need to first understand what necking is. Necking is a phenomenon that occurs in tensile testing where the cross-sectional area of the specimen decreases rapidly and the elongation of the specimen becomes non-uniform. This leads to a localized deformation and ultimately to fracture.

The true stress at necking can be calculated by finding the maximum point on the flow curve. To do this, we need to differentiate the flow curve equation with respect to true strain and equate it to zero to find the point of maximum true stress.

dσ/d$ε$ = 1750(0.37)$ε^(0.37-1)$ = 647.5 $ε^(-0.63)$

Setting this expression equal to zero and solving for $ε$, we get:

647.5 $ε^(-0.63)$ = 0

$ε$ = 0

This means that the maximum true stress occurs at a true strain of zero, which is the beginning of the deformation process. Therefore, the true stress at necking cannot be determined from the given flow curve equation.

Answer: The true stress at necking cannot be determined from the given information.
