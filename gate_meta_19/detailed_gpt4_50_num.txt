Since there is no image provided in the question, I will use a general approach to interpret the given information and solve the problem. 

The following information is given:
- S-N curve for a steel is available (also known as the "Wöhler curve"), which depicts the relationship between the stress amplitude and the number of cycles to failure (N).
- Stress ratio, (σ_min/σ_max) = -0.8.

An S-N curve typically shows the fatigue limit, at which the number of cycles to failure becomes infinite (or virtually infinite). The fatigue limit can be denoted by σ_f.

Our task is to find the maximum stress (in MPa) that the steel can withstand for infinite fatigue life.

To solve this problem, we first need to convert the stress ratio to the mean stress (σ_m) and the stress amplitude (σ_a).

We know that:
1. σ_a = (σ_max - σ_min) / 2
2. σ_m = (σ_max + σ_min) / 2

Combine the two equations above with the given stress ratio:
σ_min = -0.8 * σ_max

Now plug this into the equations (1) and (2):
1. σ_a = (σ_max - (-0.8 * σ_max)) / 2 = (1.8 * σ_max) / 2
2. σ_m = (σ_max + (-0.8 * σ_max)) / 2 = (0.2 * σ_max) / 2

Then, we need to find where the material can withstand infinite life on the given S-N curve. This point is the fatigue limit (σ_f). We can now use one of the fatigue failure criteria to estimate the stress level that corresponds to the infinite life, such as the Goodman criterion or the Soderberg criterion.

Let's use the Goodman criterion, which states that:

(σ_a / σ_f) + (σ_m / σ_ult) = 1

Where σ_ult is the ultimate tensile strength of the material.

From the S-N curve given (in the original problem, which is not provided in the present question), find the value of σ_f, and substitute the expressions we found above for σ_a and σ_m:

((1.8 * σ_max) / (2 * σ_f)) + ((0.2 * σ_max) / (2 * σ_ult)) = 1

From the same curve, find the value of σ_ult.

Now, solve the equation for σ_max:

σ_max = 2 * σ_f * σ_ult / (1.8 * σ_ult + 0.2 * σ_f)

Finally, round this value to the nearest integer to get the maximum stress in MPa that the steel can withstand for infinite fatigue life.

Without the image or specific values for the S-N curve, we cannot provide a concrete numerical answer to the problem. However, the general procedure to find the maximum stress that the steel can withstand for infinite fatigue life is described above. Once you have the S-N curve with specific values, you can easily apply this procedure to find the desired maximum stress.
