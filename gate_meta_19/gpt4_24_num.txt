To find the wavelength of the X-rays, we'll use Bragg's Law:

nλ = 2d * sin(θ)

where n is the order of reflection (usually 1 for X-ray diffraction), λ is the wavelength, d is the interplanar spacing, and θ is the Bragg angle.

First, let's find the interplanar spacing (d) using the lattice parameter (a) for a FCC crystal:

For a (111) plane in a FCC crystal, the formula for d is:

d = a/(√(h^2 + k^2 + l^2))

where h, k, and l are the plane indices (1, 1, and 1 in this case).

d = 0.3615 / (√(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2))
d = 0.3615 / (√3)
d = 0.3615 / 1.732
d ≈ 0.2086 nm

Now we can use Bragg's Law to find the wavelength:

λ = (2d * sin(θ))/n

We'll assume n = 1 (first order reflection):

λ = (2 * 0.2086 * sin(21.68°))/1
λ ≈ 2 * 0.2086 * 0.3704
λ ≈ 0.1544 nm

So, the wavelength of the X-rays is approximately 0.154 nm. We'll round off to three decimal places:

λ ≈ 0.154 nm

The correct answer is [0.154].
