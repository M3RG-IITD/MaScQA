To determine the number of independent dimensionless variables needed to describe the phenomenon, we will use the Buckingham π theorem. 

Step 1: Identify the number of variables and their dimensions.
We are given 5 variables: U, d, W, µ, and ρ. The dimensions of these variables are:
- U (velocity): [LT^(-1)]
- d (diameter): [L]
- W (apparent weight): [MLT^(-2)] 
- µ (viscosity): [ML^(-1)T^(-1)] 
- ρ (density): [ML^(-3)]

Step 2: Determine the number of fundamental dimensions.
In this case, we have 3 fundamental dimensions: 
- M (mass)
- L (length)
- T (time)

Step 3: Apply Buckingham π theorem.
The theorem states that the number of dimensionless variables (π terms) in the problem is equal to the difference between the number of given variables (n) and the number of fundamental dimensions (k):
Number of π terms = n - k

In our case, we have:
n = 5 (U, d, W, µ, and ρ)
k = 3 (M, L, and T)

Step 4: Calculate the number of π terms.
Number of π terms = n - k = 5 - 3 = 2

Therefore, according to Buckingham π theorem, the number of independent dimensionless variables needed to describe the terminal rise velocity of a spherical shaped solid in a liquid is 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2.
