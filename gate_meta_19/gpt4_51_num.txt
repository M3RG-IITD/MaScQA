To find the true stress at necking, we need to find the true stress (σ) at maximum load (the point where necking begins) along the flow curve equation.

According to the Considère's criterion, necking begins when the increase in true stress is equal to the increase in true strain. Mathematically, this is represented as:

$$\frac{dσ}{dε} = σ$$

We can now differentiate the given flow curve equation with respect to ε:

$$σ = 1750ε^{0.37}$$

Differentiate with respect to ε:

$$\frac{dσ}{dε} = \frac{d(1750ε^{0.37})}{dε} = 1750 \cdot 0.37ε^{(0.37-1)} = 0.37 \cdot 1750ε^{-0.63}$$

Now, we set the derivative equal to σ (the flow curve equation):

$$0.37 \cdot 1750ε^{-0.63} = 1750ε^{0.37}$$

Now, let's solve for ε:

$$0.37 ε^{-0.63} = ε^{0.37}$$
$$ε^{(0.37 + 0.63)} = \frac{1}{0.37}$$
$$ε = (\frac{1}{0.37})^{\frac{1}{1}}$$
$$ε = \frac{1}{0.37}$$

Now that we have found the true strain (ε) at necking, we can find the true stress (σ) at necking by plugging ε back into the flow curve equation:

$$σ = 1750\left(\frac{1}{0.37}\right)^{0.37}$$

Now calculate the value:

$$σ ≈ 4052.102$$

Rounded off to the nearest integer, the true stress at necking is 4052 MPa.

So, the correct answer is:

[4052]
