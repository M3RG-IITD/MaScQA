To calculate the density of the sample, we need to use Archimedes' principle, which states that the buoyant force on an object submerged in a fluid is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. This means that the apparent loss in weight of the object when submerged in water is equal to the weight of the water displaced by the object.

First, we need to calculate the volume of water displaced by the sample. We can use the formula:

$V_{displaced} = \frac{m_{in~air} - m_{in~water}}{\rho_{water}}$

where $m_{in~air}$ is the mass of the sample in air, $m_{in~water}$ is the apparent mass of the sample in water, and $\rho_{water}$ is the density of water.

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

$V_{displaced} = \frac{2.67~g - 1.67~g}{1.00~g~cm^{-3}} = 1.00~cm^3$

This means that the volume of the sample is 1.00 $cm^3$.

Next, we can calculate the density of the sample using the formula:

$\rho_{sample} = \frac{m_{in~air}}{V_{sample}}$

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

$\rho_{sample} = \frac{2.67~g}{1.00~cm^3} = 2.67~g~cm^{-3}$

Therefore, the density of the sample is 2.67 g $cm^(-3)$.
