To calculate the density of the given sintered sample, we can use the Archimedes' principle. Based on Archimedes' principle, when an object is submerged in a fluid, it experiences a buoyant force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced. In this case, the fluid is water.

The steps to calculate the density are as follows:

1. Calculate the buoyant force (loss of weight) in water.
2. Calculate the volume of the sample using the buoyant force and the density of water.
3. Calculate the density of the sample using its mass in air and the volume obtained in step 2.

Step 1: Calculate buoyant force (loss of weight) in water

Buoyant force = Mass in air - Apparent mass in water
Buoyant force = 2.67 g - 1.67 g
Buoyant force = 1.00 g

Step 2: Calculate the volume of the sample

The weight of water displaced is equal to the buoyant force. We can use the formula:

Weight of water = Volume of water * Density of water

Since the density of water is given as 1.00 g $cm^{-3}$, we can find the volume of the sample using the buoyant force.

Volume of sample = Weight of water / Density of water
Volume of sample = 1.00 g / 1.00 g $cm^{-3}$
Volume of sample = 1.00 $cm^3$

Step 3: Calculate the density of the sample

Now, we can calculate the density of the sample using its mass in air and the volume obtained in step 2.

Density of sample = Mass in air / Volume of sample
Density of sample = 2.67 g / 1.00 $cm^3$
Density of sample = 2.67 g $cm^{-3}$

However, the answer should be given up to 2 decimal places. Therefore, the density of the sample is 2.67 g $cm^{-3}$.

The final answer is [2.67].
