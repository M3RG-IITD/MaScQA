Given: 

n = 10^(12) cm^(-3)

Both electrons and holes have identical mobility, $μ_e$ = $μ_h$ = 4 * $10^4$ cm^2 V^(-1) s^(-1)

Applied voltage = 100 V, charge of electron = 1.6 * $10^(-19)$ C

We can calculate the conductivity of the intrinsic semiconductor from the given mobility as 

$σ$ = $n$ $μ_e$ = $n$ $μ_h$

$σ$ = 10^(12) * 4 * $10^4$

$σ$ = 4 * $10^(16)$ S m^(-1)

Let us consider a cube of edge length 1 cm. The potential difference applied between the two opposite faces is 100 V. Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field inside the cube is 

$E$ = $\frac{V}{L}$

$E$ = $\frac{100}{0.01}$

$E$ = 10^4 V m^(-1)

Using Ohm's law, the current density $j$ in the semiconductor is given by

$j$ = $σ$ $E$

$j$ = (4 * $10^(16)$) (10^4)

$j$ = 4 * $10^(20)$ A m^(-2)

The current through the cube is the product of current density and area 

$I$ = $j$ $A$

$I$ = (4 * $10^(20)$) (0.01 * 0.01)

$I$ = 4 * $10^(16)$ A

The current is in Amperes, but we need to convert it to milliamperes. 

$I$ (in mA) = $I$ (in A) $*10^(3)$

$I$ (in mA) = 4 * $10^(-11)$ * $10^3$ 

$I$ (in mA) = 4 * $10^(-8)$

$I$ (in mA) = 40 micro A = 0.04 mA

Therefore, the correct option is (E) None of the above.
