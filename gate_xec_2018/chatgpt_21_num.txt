The (110) plane of a BCC (Body-centered cubic) iron crystal will have iron atoms at the corners of the unit cell as well as one iron atom at the center of the unit cell. 

Let's find the area of the (110) plane. For a BCC crystal, the (110) plane intersects three unit cells as shown below:

The length of the diagonal of the unit cell can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:

$\sqrt{a^2 + a^2 + a^2} = \sqrt{3}a$

where $a$ is the lattice parameter of iron. Therefore, the area of the base of the unit cell is:

$A_{base} = a^2$

The height of the (110) plane can be found by considering that it intersects the diagonal of a face of the unit cell, which has a length of $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}a$. Therefore, the height of the (110) plane is:

$h = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}a$

The area of the (110) plane is then:

$A = 3A_{base}h = 3a^2\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}a = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}a^3$

The planar atomic density is the number of atoms per unit area, which is given by:

$N = \frac{1}{A}$

Therefore, substituting the value of $A$ in the above equation, we get:

$N = \frac{2}{3\sqrt{2}}\frac{1}{a^2} = 3.17\times10^{-3} nm^{-2}$ (rounded to 2 decimal places)

Answer: The planar atomic density in the (110) plane of a BCC iron crystal is 3.17 $nm^{-2}$.
