The stress intensity factor for a through-thickness crack under tensile stress is given by:

$K_I = \sigma\sqrt{\pi a}$

where $\sigma$ is the applied stress and $a$ is the half-length of the crack.

The critical stress for crack propagation is given by:

$\sigma_c = \frac{K_{IC}^2}{E\sqrt{\pi a}}$

where $K_{IC}$ is the fracture toughness, and $E$ is the elastic modulus.

Substituting the given values, we get:

$\sigma_c = \frac{(25)^2}{200\times\sqrt{\pi\times 1}} = 55.96\text{ MPa}$ (rounded off to the nearest whole number)

Therefore, the fracture stress is 56 MPa.
