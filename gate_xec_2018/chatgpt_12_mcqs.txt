The given conduction electron concentration (n) = $10^(12)$ cm^(-3). The volume of the cube can be calculated as $1 cm^3$.

The charge carrier density (i.e., electrons in this case) can be calculated as follows:

charge carrier density = Volume * conduction electron concentration = $10^{-6}$ cm^3 * $10^{12}$ cm^(-3) = $10^6$ cm^(-3)

The current density can be calculated as follows:

current density = charge carrier density * charge of electron * mobility * electric field

Here, the electric field can be calculated as V/l, where V is the applied voltage and l is the length of the cube. As both parallel end faces of the cube are connected through Ohmic contacts, the length of the cube, l = 1 cm.

So, electric field = 100 V/1 cm = 10000 V/m

Substituting the given values, we get:

current density = $10^6$ cm^(-3) * 1.6 * $10^(-19)$ C * 4 * $10^4$ cm^2 $V^(-1)$ s^(-1) * 10000 V/m

current density = 64 A/m^2

The current through the cube can be calculated as:

current = current density * area of one face of the cube

area of one face of the cube = (1 cm)^2 = $10^{-4}$ m^2

current = 64 A/m^2 * $10^{-4}$ m^2 = 6.4 mA

Therefore, the current through the cube would be 6.4 mA, which is closest to option (A) 640 mA.

Answer: (A) 640
