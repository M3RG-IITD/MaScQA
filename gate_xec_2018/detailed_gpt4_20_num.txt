To calculate the maximum number of peaks that can be observed in an X-ray diffraction pattern, we need to apply Bragg's law and the concept of the structure factor.

Bragg's law relates the diffraction angle (θ), the wavelength (λ) of the X-ray source, and the interplanar spacing (d) in a crystal lattice:

nλ = 2d * sin(θ)

Where n is an integer and is called the order of the reflection.

In an FCC crystal lattice, the interplanar spacing (d) can be calculated using the Miller indices (h, k, l) and the lattice parameter (a):

d(hkl) = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²)

To find all the possible peaks, we need to calculate d(hkl) for different values of h, k, and l. However, we also have to consider the structure factor, which determines whether the peak will be observed or not. 

The structure factor (F) for an FCC crystal is given by the equation:

F(hkl) = f(1 + exp(iπ(h + k)) + exp(iπ(k + l)) + exp(iπ(h + l)))

Where f is the number of electrons per atom and i is the imaginary unit. If F(hkl) is equal to zero, no peak will be observed for that particular h, k, l set. For a peak to be observed, the sum of h, k, and l must be even:

h + k + l = 2n

Now, let's start solving the problem systematically:

1. Identify the smallest possible value of d that results in an observable peak. This occurs when h = 1, k = 1, and l = 1:

d(111) = a / sqrt(1² + 1² + 1²) = 0.405 / sqrt(3) = 0.2337 nm

2. Use Bragg's law to determine the highest possible order of the reflection (n):

n(λ = 0.229 nm) = 2d * sin(θ)

Since the maximum value of sin(θ) is 1, the maximum order occurs when θ = 90°:

n = 2d * 1
n = 2 * 0.2337 nm / 0.229 nm
n ≈ 2.04

Since n must be an integer, the maximum order is n = 2.

3. Find all possible combinations of h, k, and l that result in a sum being even and calculate d(hkl) using the interplanar spacing formula. After, use Bragg's Law to determine if a peak can be observed for each combination:

(200): d = 0.405 / sqrt(2² + 0² + 0²) = 0.286 nm
(220): d = 0.405 / sqrt(2² + 2² + 0²) = 0.143 nm
(222): d = 0.405 / sqrt(2² + 2² + 2²) = 0.116 nm

The observations with n = 1 may have reflections at larger d because the larger order reflections may overlap. Among these reflections, only (222) reflection can be observed, and other reflections get cancelled out due to the structure factor. The (222) reflection has n = 2:

d_max = 0.116 nm

4. Check if any other reflections are possible using Bragg's law (nλ = 2d * sin(θ)):

For n = 2:
(111) reflection: d = 0.2337 nm (not possible because λ < 2d)

This indicates that we cannot have more than two orders (n = 1 and n = 2).

5. Calculate the total number of observable peaks for each reflection:

(200): 1 peak
(220): 1 peak
(222): 1 peak (n = 1) + 1 peak (n = 2)

The total number of observable peaks is:

[1 (200) + 1 (220) + 2 (222)] = [4] peaks in total.
