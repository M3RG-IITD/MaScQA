Given the wavelength of the released photon, we can first find the energy of a single photon using the formula:

E (energy) = (h * c) / λ

where E is the energy of the photon, h is the Planck's constant (6.6 * $10^{-34}$ J s), c is the speed of light (3 * $10^8$ m/s), and λ is the wavelength (500 nm).

We need to convert the wavelength from nm to meters:

500 nm = 500 * $10^{-9}$ m

Now, we can calculate the energy of a single photon:

E = (6.6 * $10^{-34}$ J s) * (3 * $10^8$ m/s) / (500 * $10^{-9}$ m)

E = 3.96 * $10^{-19}$ J

Now, we need to find the total number of atoms in the excited state (higher energy level). Given that 7 * $10^{20}$ atoms are pumped into the upper level with 4 * $10^{20}$ atoms already in the lower level, the total number of atoms in the excited state is:

Total_atoms = 7 * $10^{20}$ - 4 * $10^{20}$

Total_atoms = 3 * $10^{20}$

Finally, we can find the total energy released in a single pulse by multiplying the energy of a single photon by the total number of atoms in the excited state:

Total_energy = E * Total_atoms

Total_energy = (3.96 * $10^{-19}$ J) * (3 * $10^{20}$)

Total_energy = 11.88 * $10^{1}$ J

Total_energy = 118.8 J

Therefore, the amount of energy released in a single pulse is 118.8 Joules (rounded to two decimal places).
