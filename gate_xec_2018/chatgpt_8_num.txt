The formula for specific heat capacity of a 2D solid is given as:

𝐶𝑝 = 𝑏𝑇^𝑛

where 𝑏 is a constant and 𝑛 is the variation of lattice specific heat as a function of temperature T.

We need to find the value of n.

There are different ways to approach this problem, but one possible method is to use dimensional analysis. The units of specific heat capacity are J/(kg·K) or equivalently, N·m/(kg·K). The units of temperature are K. The units of 𝑏 are therefore (N·m)/(kg·K^(n+1)).

Using dimensional analysis, we can write:

𝐶𝑝 = [𝑏𝑇^(𝑛)] = [(N·m)/(kg·K^(n+1))]·(K^(n)) = (N·m)/(kg·K)

Equating the units on both sides, we get:

[N·m]/[kg·K] = (N·m)/(kg·K)

This equation holds only if n = 2, because:

K^(-n-1) · K^n = K^(-1) = 1/K

Therefore, the value of n is 2.

Answer: 

The value of 𝑛 is 2.
