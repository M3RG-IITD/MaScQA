Given, 
- Length of crack = 2 mm
- Fracture toughness, $K_(1C)$ = 25 MPa ‚àöùëö

We know that the stress intensity factor for a plate with a through-thickness crack under tension is given by:

$$ K_I = \sigma \sqrt{\pi a} $$

Where,
- $K_I$: Stress intensity factor
- $\sigma$: Tensile stress
- $a$: Half-length of the crack

Also, the critical stress required for propagation of the crack is given by:

$$ \sigma_c = \frac{K_I^2}{K_(1C)^2} $$

Substituting the value of $K_I$ in the above equation, we get:

$$ \sigma_c = \frac{\sigma^2 \pi a}{K_(1C)^2} $$

Since the crack length is given as 2 mm, the half-length of the crack is 1 mm or 0.001 m.

Substituting the given values, we get:

$$ \sigma_c = \frac{\sigma^2 \pi (0.001)}{(25)^2} $$

Solving for $\sigma$, we get:

$$ \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sigma_c K_(1C)^2}{\pi (0.001)}} $$

Substituting the value of $\sigma_c$, we get:

$$ \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\left(\frac{\sigma^2 \pi (0.001)}{(25)^2}\right) (25)^2}{\pi (0.001)}} $$

Solving for $\sigma$, we get:

$$ \sigma = 25\ MPa $$

Therefore, the fracture stress in MPa is 25 MPa (rounded off to the nearest whole number).

Answer: 
- 25 MPa
