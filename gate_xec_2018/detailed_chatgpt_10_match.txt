In order to match the invariant reactions with their respective names, we need to first understand the meaning of the terms given in Column II. 

1. Eutectic: A two-component alloy in which the solid α and β phases form simultaneously from the liquid phase L on cooling, at a specific temperature and composition.
2. Peritectic: A reaction in which a solid γ reacts with the liquid L to form the solid α and β phases, at a specific temperature and composition.
3. Peritectoid: A reaction in which the solid α reacts with the liquid L to form the solid β and γ phases, at a specific temperature and composition.
4. Eutectoid: A reaction in which the solid α transforms into the solid phases β and γ simultaneously, at a specific temperature and composition.
5. Monotectic: A reaction in which the liquid L separates into two immiscible liquids (a and b) at a specific temperature and composition.

Now let's match the invariant reactions given in Column I with their respective names:

P: L ⇄ α + β 
This reaction involves a single liquid phase transforming into two solid phases. It is similar to a eutectic reaction, but instead of two solid phases transforming into a liquid, a single liquid phase transforms into two solid phases. Therefore, this reaction can be classified as a eutectic reaction, and the correct answer is option (A) P-5.

Q: L + α ⇄ β 
This reaction involves a liquid phase and a solid phase transforming into another solid phase. This type of reaction can be classified as a peritectoid reaction, and the correct answer is option (B) P-3.

R: γ ⇄ α + β 
This reaction involves a single solid phase transforming into two solid phases. It is similar to a eutectoid reaction, but instead of two solid phases transforming into a single solid phase, a single solid phase transforms into two solid phases. Therefore, this reaction can be classified as a eutectoid reaction, and the correct answer is option (D) P-4.

S: α + β ⇄ γ
This reaction involves two solid phases transforming into a single solid phase. This type of reaction can be classified as a peritectic reaction, and the correct answer is option (C) P-2.

Therefore, the correct answer is option (A) P-5, Q-1, R-4, S-3.
