The amount of electric charge, Q that passes through a galvanic cell is related to the amount of substance, n, (in moles) that undergoes oxidation or reduction as follows:

Q = nF

where F is the Faraday constant (96500 C/mol of electrons). The amount of substance, n, can be calculated by dividing the electric charge by the Faraday constant:

n = Q/F

In this case, 48250 C of charge is produced, so:

n = 48250 C / 96500 C/mol = 0.5 mol of electrons

Since the oxidation of one magnesium atom produces two electrons, the amount of magnesium that dissolves into the solution is equal to:

0.5 mol of electrons / 2 mol of electrons per Mg atom = 0.25 mol of Mg

Finally, the mass of Mg can be calculated using its atomic weight (24 g/mol) and the amount in moles:

Mass of Mg = 0.25 mol x 24 g/mol = 6 g

Therefore, the answer is (A) 6 g.
