The energy released when a single photon is emitted is given by the relation:

$E = hf$ , where h is the Planckâ€™s constant and f is the frequency of the photon.

We can find the frequency of the photon using the relation $c = \lambda f$, where c is the speed of light, and $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the photon.

Thus, $f = c/\lambda = (3 * 10^8) / (500 * 10^{-9}) = 6 * 10^{14} Hz$

We can now find the energy released by a single atom when it undergoes transition as:

$E = hf = 6.6 * 10^{-34} * 6 * 10^{14} = 3.96 * 10^{-19} J$

The total energy released when 7 * $10^{20}$ atoms make the transition is:

$E_{total} = N * E$

where N is the number of atoms that make the transition, and E is the energy released per atom.

So, $E_{total} = (7 * 10^{20}) * 3.96 * 10^{-19} = 2.77 * 10^2 J$

Hence, the total amount of energy released in a single pulse is 2.77 * $10^2$ J or 277 J (rounded to 2 decimal places).

Answer: [277.00 J]
