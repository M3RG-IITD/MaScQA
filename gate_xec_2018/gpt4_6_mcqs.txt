For a nonlinear triatomic molecule, the number of vibrational degrees of freedom is given by:

Vibrational degrees of freedom = 3N - 6

where N is the number of atoms in the molecule. In this case, N = 3 (since it's a triatomic molecule).

Vibrational degrees of freedom = 3(3) - 6 = 9 - 6 = 3

Answer: (D) 3
