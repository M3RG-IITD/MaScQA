To calculate the density of the sample, we need to use Archimedes' principle, which states that the buoyant force acting on a submerged object is equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces. We can use the following formula to find the true volume and density of the sample:

True Volume = (Mass in air - Apparent mass in water) / Density of water

We are given the mass of the sample in air (2.67 g) and its apparent mass in water (1.67 g), and we know the density of water (1.00 g $cm^{-3}$).

First, we need to find the true volume of the sample:

True Volume = (2.67 g - 1.67 g) / 1.00 g $cm^{-3}$
True Volume = 1.00 cm³

Now, we can find the density of the sample by dividing its mass by its true volume:

Density of sample = Mass in air / True Volume
Density of sample = 2.67 g / 1.00 cm³
Density of sample = 2.67 g $cm^{-3}$

The density of the sample is 2.67 g $cm^{-3}$, rounded to two decimal places. The answer is [2.67].
