To find the Young's modulus (E_c) of the composite, we can use the rule of mixtures formula for a unidirectionally aligned fiber-reinforced composite. The rule of mixtures formula states that:

E_c = V_f * E_f + V_m * E_m

Where:
- E_c is the composite Young's modulus,
- V_f is the volume fraction of the fibers (in this case, 0.6),
- E_f is the Young's modulus of the fibers (200 GPa),
- V_m is the volume fraction of the matrix (which is 1 - V_f = 0.4),
- E_m is the Young's modulus of the matrix material (10 GPa).

Now, we can plug in the values to get the composite Young's modulus:

E_c = (0.6 * 200) + (0.4 * 10)

E_c = 120 + 4

E_c = 124 GPa

Thus, the Young's modulus of the composite is 124 GPa.

Answer: [124]
