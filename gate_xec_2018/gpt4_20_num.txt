To determine the maximum number of peaks that can be observed in the X-ray diffraction pattern, we can use the Bragg's law and the structure factor for FCC lattice. 

Bragg's law: nλ = 2d*sinθ

The structure factor for FCC lattice is F = 1 + exp(ihπ) + exp(ikπ) + exp(ilπ) and it will be non-zero only if h, k, and l are either all even or all odd.

Here, n = 1 (since we're considering the smallest angle, and hence the first order of diffraction)

The interplanar spacing (d) for hkl planes in a cubic lattice is given by:

1/d² = (h²+k²+l²) / a²

The maximum possible value of 1/d² is given by the condition for the Bragg's law:

1/d² = (4 * sin²θ) / λ²

Since we're looking for the maximum number of peaks, we'll consider the highest possible angle, θ = 90°.

So, sin²θ = 1 and the maximum possible value of 1/d² becomes:

1/d² = 4 / λ² 

Now, we must find the maximum integer value (n) for which:

(h²+k²+l²) / a² <= 1/d²_max 

Replacing the known values:

a = 0.405 nm
λ = 0.229 nm

1/d²_max = 4 / (0.229)² = 76.29

We now have to find the highest integer value n satisfying:

n² / (0.405)² <= 76.29

Let's find the highest possible value of n:

n² <= (0.405)² * 76.29
n² <= 12.51 (approx.)

The highest possible integral value of n is 3. So, the maximum hkl values are: 333, 311, 222.

However, due to systematic extinctions in the FCC lattice, the 222 peak will be absent. This leaves us with two possible peaks, which are 333 and 311.

The maximum number of peaks that can be observed in the pattern is [2].
