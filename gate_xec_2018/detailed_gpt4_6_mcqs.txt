To find the number of vibrational degrees of freedom for a non-linear triatomic molecule, we first need to understand the concept of degrees of freedom.

Degrees of freedom are the number of independent ways a system can move or store energy. For a molecule, these degrees can be divided into categories: translation, rotation, and vibration.

1. Translation: In three-dimensional space, a molecule can move in x, y, and z directions. So there are 3 translational degrees of freedom.

2. Rotation: For a non-linear molecule, it can rotate about 3 axes, which are not necessarily the x, y, and z axes. However, for a non-linear triatomic molecule, there are 3 atoms that do not lie in a straight line, meaning it can rotate in only 2 axes. So there are 2 rotational degrees of freedom.

Next, let's find out the vibrational degrees of freedom. 

For any molecule with "n" number of atoms, the total degrees of freedom can be given as:

Total degrees of freedom = 3n

Since we have a triatomic (3 atoms) non-linear molecule, the total degrees of freedom would be:

Total degrees of freedom = 3 * 3 = 9

Now, we have already calculated the translational and rotational degrees of freedom, so we can now calculate the vibrational degrees of freedom as:

Vibrational degrees of freedom = Total degrees of freedom - Translational degrees of freedom - Rotational degrees of freedom

Vibrational degrees of freedom = 9 - 3 - 2 = 4

So, the number of vibrational degrees of freedom for a non-linear triatomic molecule is 4.

The correct answer is (C) 4.
