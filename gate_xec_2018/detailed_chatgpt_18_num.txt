The energy levels of a particle in an infinite potential well of width $L$ are given by the equation:

$$E_n=\frac{n^2\pi^2\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$$

where $n$ is the quantum number, $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck’s constant, and $m$ is the mass of the particle.

For a system of three identical non-interacting spin ½ particles, the ground state consists of three particles with opposite spins occupying the three lowest energy states. Since the particles are identical, two particles can’t occupy the same energy level, and so each of the lowest three levels must be occupied by one particle. Thus, the ground state energy of this system is:

$$E_{\text{3 particles}}=E_1+E_2+E_3=\frac{1^2\pi^2\hbar^2}{2mL^2}+\frac{2^2\pi^2\hbar^2}{2mL^2}+\frac{3^2\pi^2\hbar^2}{2mL^2}=\frac{14\pi^2\hbar^2}{2mL^2}=18\text{ meV}$$

Solving for $L$, we get:

$$L=\sqrt{\frac{14\pi^2\hbar^2}{2mE_{\text{3 particles}}}}$$

For a system of seven particles, the ground state will consist of the seven lowest energy levels, with each level being occupied by one particle. Since each particle has the same mass as in the three-particle case, the only thing that changes is the width $L$ of the well. Therefore, the ground state energy of the seven-particle system is:

$$E_{\text{7 particles}}=E_1+E_2+E_3+E_4+E_5+E_6+E_7=7\cdot\frac{\pi^2\hbar^2}{2mL^2}=7\cdot\frac{\pi^2\hbar^2}{2m}\cdot\frac{E_{\text{3 particles}}}{18\cdot14\pi^2\hbar^2}=E_{\text{3 particles}}\cdot\frac{7}{252}=0.0315\text{ meV}$$

Therefore, the new ground state energy for seven particles is 0.0315 meV.
