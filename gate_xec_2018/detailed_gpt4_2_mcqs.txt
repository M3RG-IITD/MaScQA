To answer this question, we need to be familiar with the symmetry elements present in a cubic crystal, which belong to the highest symmetry of all crystal systems. The cubic crystal system is characterized by its three mutually perpendicular axes that are equal in length. 

The minimum symmetry that a cubic crystal must possess is defined by its point group. The cubic crystal system has five point groups with the least symmetry elements known as the tetrahedral point groups.

Now let's analyze each given option:

A) Four 3-fold rotation axes.
The tetrahedral point group (T) has four 3-fold rotation axes, which means that there are four axes about which a rotation of 120 degrees (360 degrees/3) brings the crystal back to an identical configuration. This is the minimum symmetry possessed by a cubic crystal.

B) Three 4-fold rotation axes.
This option describes the point group O, which is the octahedral point group. This group has higher symmetry than the tetrahedral point group with three 4-fold rotation axes. A cubic crystal must have at least the tetrahedral point group symmetry.

C) Three orthogonal mirror planes.
Three orthogonal mirror planes describe the symmetry of the orthorhombic crystal system, which is a different crystal system from the cubic one. This option is not correct.

D) Centre of symmetry.
A center of symmetry means that there is a central point from which every point on the crystal is reflected onto another identical point. This also doesn't describe the minimum symmetry that a cubic crystal must possess.

So the correct answer is [A].
