We will use Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle to find the fundamental accuracy in the position of the electron. 

The uncertainty principle is given by:
Δx * Δp ≥ h/(4π)

where Δx is the uncertainty in position, Δp is the uncertainty in momentum, and h is Planck's constant.

First, we need to calculate the uncertainty in the momentum (Δp). Since we are given the speed and the uncertainty percentage, we can calculate the uncertainty in speed first:

Uncertainty in speed (Δv) = Speed * Uncertainty percentage
Δv = 300 m/s * 0.01% = 300 * 0.0001 = 0.03 m/s

Now, we can find the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) using Δp = m * Δv, where m is the mass of the electron:

Δp = 9.1 * 10^(-31) kg * 0.03 m/s = 2.73 * 10^(-32) kg m/s

Now, using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle formula, we can solve for Δx:

Δx ≥ h/(4πΔp)
Δx ≥ (6.6 * 10^(-34) J s) / (4π * 2.73 * 10^(-32) kg m/s)
Δx ≥ (6.6 * 10^(-34)) / (4π * 2.73 * 10^(-32))
Δx ≥ 1.53 * 10^(-2) m

Since we need to convert the position uncertainty to millimeters, we must multiply by 1000:

Δx ≥ 1.53 * 10^(-2) m * 1000 = 15.3 mm

So, the fundamental accuracy with which the position of the electron can be determined simultaneously with the speed is 15.3 mm. The answer in a list format rounded to 2 decimal places would be:
