First, we need to find the number of moles of electrons produced during the anodic reaction:

moles of electrons = Coulomb Charge / Faraday Constant
moles of electrons = 48250 C / 96500 C/mole of electrons
moles of electrons = 0.5 mole

In the anodic reaction, each mole of Mg produces 2 moles of electrons:

moles of Mg = moles of electrons / 2
moles of Mg = 0.5 mole / 2
moles of Mg = 0.25 mole

Now we can find the amount of Mg dissolved into the solution:

Amount of Mg = moles of Mg * Atomic weight of Mg
Amount of Mg = 0.25 mole * 24 g/mole
Amount of Mg = 6 g

So, the amount of Mg dissolved into the solution is 6 grams.
