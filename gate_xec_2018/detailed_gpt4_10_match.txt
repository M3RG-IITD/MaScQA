To match the invariant reactions in Column I with the names in Column II, we need to understand the definitions of the terms in Column II:

(1) Monotectic: A three-phase reaction in which a liquid phase reacts with a solid phase to form another solid phase (L + α ⇄ β).

(2) Peritectoid: A three-phase reaction in which all participating phases are solid (α + β ⇄ γ).

(3) Peritectic: A three-phase reaction in which a liquid phase reacts with a solid phase to form another solid phase (L + α ⇄ β).

(4) Eutectoid: A three-phase reaction in which one solid phase transforms into two other solid phases upon cooling (γ ⇄ α + β).

(5) Eutectic: A three-phase reaction in which a liquid phase transforms into two solid phases upon cooling (L ⇄ α + β).

Now we can match the reactions in Column I with the terms in Column II:

(P) 𝐿 ⇄ 𝛼 + 𝛽: This is a three-phase reaction in which a liquid phase transforms into two solid phases upon cooling. It corresponds to Eutectic (5).

(Q) 𝐿 + 𝛼 ⇄ 𝛽: This is a three-phase reaction in which a liquid phase reacts with a solid phase to form another solid phase. It corresponds to Monotectic (1).

(R) 𝛾 ⇄ 𝛼 + 𝛽: This is a three-phase reaction in which one solid phase transforms into two other solid phases upon cooling. It corresponds to Eutectoid (4).

(S) 𝛼 + 𝛽 ⇄ 𝛾: This is a three-phase reaction in which all participating phases are solid. It corresponds to Peritectoid (2).

So the correct matching is:

P - 5, Q - 1, R - 4, S - 2.

The correct option is (C).
