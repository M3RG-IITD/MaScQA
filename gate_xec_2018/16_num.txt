(Given: Planckâ€™s constant, h = 6.6 * $10^(-34)$ J s; speed of light, c = 3 * $10^8$ m $s^(-1)$). The atoms in a gas laser have two energy levels such that a transition from the higher to the lower level releases a photon of wavelength 500 nm. If 7 * $10^(20)$ atoms are pumped into the upper level with 4 * $10^(20)$ atoms in the lower level, the amount of energy released in a single pulse in Joules (give answer up to 2 decimal places).
