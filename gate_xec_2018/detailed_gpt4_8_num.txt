To find the value of n, we need to study the specific heat capacity in the low-temperature regime for a two-dimensional solid. The specific heat capacity of a solid at low temperatures can be described by Debye's theory.

Debye's theory states that the specific heat capacity of crystalline solids at low temperatures depends on the phonon modes, which are quantized elastic vibrations that propagate through the lattice.

In the low-temperature limit, the specific heat capacity is related to the number of available vibrational modes, which becomes limited due to quantum mechanical effects. For a D-dimensional solid, the Debye approximation states that the specific heat capacity is proportional to T^D.

In our case, we are given a two-dimensional solid, so D=2. Therefore, the specific heat capacity at low temperatures will be proportional to T^2.

Hence, the value of n for a two-dimensional solid in the low-temperature regime is 2.

The correct answer is [2].
