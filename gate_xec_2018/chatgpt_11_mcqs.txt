From the given reaction, we see that for every 2 moles of electrons (2F), 1 mole of Mg is dissolved into the solution. This means that for 1F, 1/2 mole of Mg is dissolved. 

Now, we are given that 48250 Coulombs of charge is produced during the reaction. Using Faraday's constant, we can calculate the number of moles of electrons as follows: 

Number of moles of electrons = charge / Faraday's constant 
= 48250 / 96500 
= 0.5 

So, 0.5 moles of electrons correspond to 1/4 moles of Mg (since 2 moles of electrons correspond to 1 mole of Mg). 

Finally, we can use the atomic weight of Mg to calculate the mass of Mg dissolved: 

Mass of Mg = number of moles of Mg * atomic weight of Mg 
= (1/4) * 24 
= 6 g 

Therefore, the amount of Mg dissolved into the solution is 6 g.
