Let's analyze the possible situations in which the atom can return back to the starting point after four jumps.

First, let's represent a jump to the right as R and a jump to the left as L.

1. The atom makes 2 jumps to the right and 2 jumps to the left: RRLL
2. The atom makes 2 jumps to the left and 2 jumps to the right: LLRR
3. The atom jumps right, left, right, and left: RLLR
4. The atom jumps left, right, left, and right: LRLR

These are the only four possible sequences of moves that end with the atom returning back to the starting point.

Now, let's calculate the probability of each sequence occurring:

1. The probability of RRLL: P(RRLL) = P(R) * P(R) * P(L) * P(L) = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/16
2. The probability of LLRR: P(LLRR) = P(L) * P(L) * P(R) * P(R) = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/16
3. The probability of RLLR: P(RLLR) = P(R) * P(L) * P(L) * P(R) = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/16
4. The probability of LRLR: P(LRLR) = P(L) * P(R) * P(L) * P(R) = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/16

Now, we find the total probability of the atom returning back to the starting point by summing up the individual probabilities:

P(total) = P(RRLL) + P(LLRR) + P(RLLR) + P(LRLR) = 1/16 + 1/16 + 1/16 + 1/16 = 4/16 = 1/4 = 0.250

Therefore, the probability of the atom returning to the starting point after four jumps is 0.250, which corresponds to option (A).

Answer: [0.250]
