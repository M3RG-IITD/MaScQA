To find the fracture stress, we can use the equation for Mode I stress intensity factor ($K_I$), which relates the applied tensile stress, $\sigma$, crack length, and fracture toughness. The equation is:

$K_I = \sigma \sqrt{\pi a}$

where $K_I$ is the Mode I stress intensity factor, $\sigma$ is the applied tensile stress, and $a$ is half of the crack length (since we are given the through-thickness crack length, we need to divide it by 2 to get the radius of the crack).

To find the fracture stress ($\sigma_f$), we set the stress intensity factor equal to the fracture toughness, $K_{1C}$:

$K_{1C} = \sigma_f \sqrt{\pi a}$

Now we can solve for the fracture stress using the given values:

Fracture toughness, $K_{1C} = 25 \,\text{MPa} \sqrt{\text{m}}$

Crack length, $2 \,\text{mm} = 0.002 \,\text{m}$

Half crack length, $a = 0.001 \,\text{m}$

Plug in the values:

$25 \,\text{MPa} \sqrt{\text{m}} = \sigma_f \sqrt{\pi (0.001 \,\text{m})}$

Now solve for $\sigma_f$:

$\sigma_f = \frac{25 \,\text{MPa} \sqrt{\text{m}}}{\sqrt{\pi (0.001 \,\text{m})}}$

Calculate the value:

$\sigma_f = \frac{25 \,\text{MPa} \sqrt{\text{m}}}{\sqrt{3.14 \times 10^{-3} \,\text{m}}} = 446.77 \,\text{MPa}$

Round off to the nearest whole number:

$\sigma_f \approx 447\,\text{MPa}$

Therefore, the fracture stress in MPa is approximately 447.

The correct answer is [447].
