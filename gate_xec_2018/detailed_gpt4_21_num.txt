To find the planar atomic density in the (110) plane of a BCC iron crystal, we'll follow these steps:

Step 1: Find the length of the (110) plane in the unit cell.
Step 2: Calculate the number of atoms on the (110) plane.
Step 3: Compute the planar atomic density in the (110) plane.

Step 1:
The lattice parameter of BCC iron is given as a = 0.287 nm. Let's first calculate the length of the (110) plane in the unit cell.

For BCC lattice, the diagonal of the cube which passes through the body center is the close-packed direction (CPD). The (110) plane is perpendicular to the CPD.

In BCC, the length of the CPD can be found using the following formula:
CPD = √(a² + a²) = √(2a²)

Now, let's find the diagonal of the (110) plane which is perpendicular to the CPD. We will use the Pythagorean theorem for this by considering the right-angled triangle formed by the diagonal of the (110) plane, diagonal of the face and the cube edge.

Let d represent the length of the (110) plane diagonal, then:
d² + a² = CPD²

Substitute the CPD formula from above:
d² + a² = (2a²)

Now, we can find d:
d² = a²
d = a = 0.287 nm

The length of the side of the (110) plane in the unit cell can be found by dividing d by √2:
Side = d / √2
Side ≈ 0.287 / √2 ≈ 0.203 nm

Step 2:
Now let's find the number of atoms on the (110) plane.

Each corner atom in the unit cell is shared by 4 adjacent unit cells in the same plane, therefore, contributes 1/4 portion of the atom to each unit cell.

The BCC unit cell has 2 lattice points. In the (110) plane, the contribution of atoms from the lattice point at the body center is 1.

So, the total number of atoms in the (110) plane inside the BCC unit cell = 2 (1/4) + 1 = 1.5

Step 3:
Finally, let's calculate the planar atomic density:

Planar atomic density = (Number of atoms in the plane) / (Area of the plane)

Area of the (110) plane = Side² ≈ (0.203 nm)² ≈ 0.041 nm²

Planar atomic density ≈ 1.5 atoms / 0.041 $nm^2$ ≈ 36.59 $nm^{-2}$

So, the planar atomic density in the (110) plane of a BCC iron crystal is approximately 36.59 $nm^{-2}$, up to 2 decimal places.
