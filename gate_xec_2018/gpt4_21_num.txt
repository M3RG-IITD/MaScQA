To find the planar atomic density, we first need to find the number of atoms per unit cell in the 110 plane of a BCC iron crystal.

In a BCC unit cell, there is one atom at each corner and one atom at the center. Corner atoms are shared by 8 unit cells, and center atom is completely inside the particular unit cell. So, in total, we have (1/8)*8 + 1 = 2 atoms per unit cell.

Now, we need to find the area of the 110 plane in the BCC iron crystal. For this, we will use the lattice parameter a = 0.287 nm.

The 110 plane in a BCC crystal can be visualized by connecting the origin (0,0,0) to the points (1,1,0) and (0,1,1). These vectors represent the edges of a parallelogram, which is the 110 plane.

To find the area, we can use the cross product method. Let the vectors of the 110 plane be A and B where A = (1, 1, 0) and B = (0, 1, 1).

First, calculate the cross product of A and B:
C = A x B
C = ( (A_y * B_z) - (A_z * B_y), (A_z * B_x) - (A_x * B_z), (A_x * B_y) - (A_y * B_x) )
C = ( (1 * 1) - (0 * 1), (0 * 0) - (1 * 1), (1 * 1) - (1 * 0) )
C = (1, -1, 1)

Now, to find the area of the parallelogram, we need the magnitude of the cross product (C):
|C| = sqrt(C_x^2 + C_y^2 + C_z^2)
|C| = sqrt(1^2 + (-1)^2 + 1^2)
|C| = sqrt(1 + 1 + 1)
|C| = sqrt(3)

Since the lattice parameter is in nm, we should multiply the coordinates of vector A by the lattice parameter to get the actual dimensions of the unit cell:
A = (0.287, 0.287, 0)

Now, we can find the actual area of the 110 plane:
Area_110 = |C| * a
Area_110 = sqrt(3) * 0.287
Area_110 ≈ 0.496 nm^2

Finally, we can find the planar atomic density in the 110 plane by dividing the number of atoms by the area:
Planar_atomic_density = No. of atoms / Area_110
Planar_atomic_density = 2 / 0.496
Planar_atomic_density ≈ 4.03 nm^(-2)

So, the planar atomic density in the 110 plane of a BCC iron crystal is approximately 4.03 nm^(-2). The answer is [4.03].
