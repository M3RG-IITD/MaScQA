Step 1: Identify the reaction
The given anodic reaction is: Mg ‚ü∂ Mg^(+2) + 2e^(-). In this reaction, one mole of magnesium produces two moles of electrons.

Step 2: Calculate the number of moles of electrons produced
Given that 48250 coulombs of charge are produced, we can calculate the number of moles of electrons using the Faraday constant, which is 96500 C/mole of electrons.

Number of moles of electrons = Charge produced / Faraday constant
Number of moles of electrons = 48250 C / 96500 C/mole
Number of moles of electrons = 0.5 moles

Step 3: Calculate the number of moles of Mg
Since one mole of Mg produces two moles of electrons, we can use the stoichiometry of the reaction to find the number of moles of Mg.

Number of moles of Mg = Number of moles of electrons / 2
Number of moles of Mg = 0.5 moles / 2
Number of moles of Mg = 0.25 moles

Step 4: Calculate the mass of Mg
Given the atomic weight of Mg (24 g/mole), we can calculate the mass of magnesium dissolved into the solution.

Mass of Mg = Number of moles of Mg * Atomic weight of Mg
Mass of Mg = 0.25 moles * 24 g/mole
Mass of Mg = 6 g

So, the amount of Mg dissolved into the solution is 6 grams.
