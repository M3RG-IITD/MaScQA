A screw dislocation is a type of defect in a crystal lattice where, along the dislocation line, the crystal lattice has a helical structure. To answer this question, let's analyze each option given:

(A) Dislocation line and Burgers vector are parallel.
In a screw dislocation, the dislocation line and the Burgers vector are indeed parallel. The Burgers vector is a vector that describes the magnitude and direction of the atomic displacement in a dislocation. In the case of a screw dislocation, this vector is parallel to the dislocation line.

(B) Direction of motion of dislocation is parallel to the Burgers vector.
In a screw dislocation, the motion of the dislocation occurs when the helical structure of the crystal lattice is propagated along the dislocation line. This means that the direction of motion of the dislocation is indeed parallel to the Burgers vector.

(C) Atomic displacement due to the movement of the dislocation is in the direction of the motion of the dislocation line.
In a screw dislocation, the atomic displacement due to the movement of the dislocation is related to the Burgers vector which, as we previously mentioned, is parallel to the dislocation line. As the dislocation moves, atoms in the crystal lattice shift along the dislocation line, causing atomic displacement.

(D) It has a unique slip plane.
A screw dislocation does not have a unique slip plane. The slip plane is the plane in which the dislocation line moves. In a screw dislocation, the actual movement of the dislocation can occur on any plane containing the dislocation line. This is due to the helical structure of the dislocation, which affects multiple planes in the crystal lattice.

Based on the analysis above, the correct answer is: [A, B, C].
