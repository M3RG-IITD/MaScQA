We can use the Arrhenius equation to solve this problem:

$$
k = A e^{-\frac{Q}{RT}}
$$

where $k$ is the rate constant, $A$ is the pre-exponential factor (which can be assumed to be constant), $Q$ is the activation energy, $R$ is the gas constant, and $T$ is temperature in Kelvin.

Let's assume that the rate of carburization is proportional to the rate constant $k$, so that the case depth is proportional to:

$$
\int_0^t k dt = kt
$$

where $t$ is the time of carburization.

Now, we are given that the case depth can be doubled by increasing the temperature while keeping the time constant. This means that the new rate constant is twice the old rate constant, or:

$$
k' = 2k
$$

Using the Arrhenius equation, we can write:

$$
\frac{k'}{k} = \frac{A e^{-\frac{Q}{RT'}}{A e^{-\frac{Q}{RT}}}} = 2
$$

Simplifying this expression, we get:

$$
e^{-\frac{Q}{R}\left(\frac{1}{T'} - \frac{1}{T}\right)} = 2
$$

Substituting the given values, we get:

$$
e^{-\frac{148 \times 10^3}{8.314} \left(\frac{1}{T'} - \frac{1}{1300}\right)} = 2
$$

Solving for $T'$, we get:

$$
T' = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{1300} - \frac{1}{\ln 2 \times 148 \times 10^3/8.314}} \approx \boxed{1414 \ \text{K}}
$$
