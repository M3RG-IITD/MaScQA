The ground state energy of a particle in an infinite potential well is given by:

E = (n^2 * h^2) / (8 * m * L^2)

Where n is the quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...), h is Planck's constant, m is the mass of the particle and L is the length of the well.

For three identical non-interacting spin ½ particles, the ground state energy would be thrice that of a single particle, i.e.,

E_3 = 3 * (1^2 * h^2) / (8 * m * L^2) = (3/8) * (h^2 / m * L^2)

Given that E_3 = 18 meV, we can solve for L:

L = sqrt[(3/8) * (h^2 / m * E_3)]

Now, for seven identical non-interacting spin ½ particles, the ground state energy would be seven times that of a single particle, i.e.,

E_7 = 7 * (1^2 * h^2) / (8 * m * L^2) = (7/8) * (h^2 / m * L^2)

Substituting for L from the earlier equation, we get:

E_7 = (7/8) * (h^2 / m * [sqrt((3/8) * (h^2 / m * E_3))])^2

Simplifying this expression, we get:

E_7 = (147/64) * (h^2 / m * E_3)

Substituting h = 6.626 x 10^-34 J s and m = mass of an electron = 9.109 x 10^-31 kg, we get:

E_7 = 10.7 meV

Therefore, the new ground state energy for seven particles is 10.7 meV.
