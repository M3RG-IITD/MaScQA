To determine the coordination number, we need to use the "cation-anion radius ratio rule" which states that the coordination number is determined by the ratio of the radii of the cation to the anion. The relationship between the coordination number and the radius ratio is given below:

Coordination number = 4 for radius ratio of 0.225 or less
Coordination number = 6 for radius ratio between 0.225 and 0.414
Coordination number = 8 for radius ratio between 0.414 and 0.732
Coordination number = 12 for radius ratio greater than 0.732

In this case, the cation to anion radius ratio is 0.6, which falls between 0.414 and 0.732. Therefore, the coordination number is likely to be 8.

Answer: 
- 8
