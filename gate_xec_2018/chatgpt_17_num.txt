We can use Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle to solve this problem:

Δx Δp ≥ h/4π

where Δx is the uncertainty in position, Δp is the uncertainty in momentum, and h is Planck's constant. We need to solve for Δx.

We know the mass of the electron and its speed, so we can calculate its momentum:

p = m*v

where p is momentum, m is mass, and v is velocity.

p = (9.1 * 10^(-31) kg)(300 m/s) = 2.73 * 10^(-23) kg m/s

Now we can calculate the uncertainty in momentum:

Δp = 0.01% * p = (0.01/100)(2.73 * 10^(-23) kg m/s) = 2.73 * 10^(-26) kg m/s

Substituting these values into the uncertainty principle equation:

Δx * (2.73 * 10^(-26) kg m/s) ≥ (6.6 * 10^(-34) J s) / (4π)

Δx ≥ (6.6 * 10^(-34) J s) / (4π * 2.73 * 10^(-26) kg m/s)

Δx ≥ 6.05 * 10^(-9) m

Finally, we convert to millimeters:

Δx = 6.05 * 10^(-6) mm

Therefore, the fundamental accuracy with which the position of the electron can be determined simultaneously with the speed in the same experiment is 6.05 * 10^(-6) mm. 

Answer: [6.05 * 10^(-6) mm]
