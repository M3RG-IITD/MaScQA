To solve this problem, we will use the Arrhenius equation, which relates the rate constant (k) of a chemical reaction to its activation energy (Q) and temperature (T):

k = A * exp(-Q / (R * T))

where A is the pre-exponential factor and exp is the exponential function.

We are given that the case depth doubles when the temperature is increased. This implies that the rate constant of the carburization process doubles as well.

Let k1 be the rate constant at 1300 K and k2 be the rate constant at the new temperature T2.

Since the case depth doubles, we can write:

k2 = 2 * k1

Now let's use the Arrhenius equation for both temperatures:

k1 = A * exp(-Q / (R * 1300))
k2 = A * exp(-Q / (R * T2))

Since k2 = 2 * k1:

A * exp(-Q / (R * T2)) = 2 * A * exp(-Q / (R * 1300))

We can then cancel out the pre-exponential factor (A):

exp(-Q / (R * T2)) = 2 * exp(-Q / (R * 1300))

Now, we will take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:

ln(exp(-Q / (R * T2))) = ln(2 * exp(-Q / (R * 1300)))

This simplifies to:

-Q / (R * T2) = ln(2) - Q / (R * 1300)

Now we can isolate T2:

T2 = Q / (R * (ln(2) - Q / (R * 1300)))

Plugging in the given values for Q and R, we get:

T2 = 148000 / (8.314 * (ln(2) - 148000 / (8.314 * 1300)))

T2 ≈ 1352.88 K

Rounding off to the nearest whole number, we get:

T2 ≈ 1353 K

So, the case depth can be doubled by increasing the temperature to 1353 K.

The correct answer is [1353].
