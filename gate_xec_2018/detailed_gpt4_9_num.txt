To determine the coordination number of a C ion surrounded by A ions, we can use the rule derived from a study of ionic structures:

1. If the cation-anion radius ratio ($r_C/r_A$) is between 0.225 to 0.414, the coordination number is 3 (trigonal);
2. If the ratio is between 0.414 to 0.732, the coordination number is 4 (tetrahedral);
3. If the ratio is between 0.732 to 1.000, the coordination number is 6 (octahedral);
4. If the ratio is greater than 1.000, the coordination number is 8 (cubical).

Now, given that the cation-anion radius ratio ($r_C/r_A$) is 0.6, we can compare it with the above ranges to find out the coordination number.

Since 0.6 lies within the range of 0.414 to 0.732, the coordination number is 4 (tetrahedral configuration).

Therefore, the answer is [4].
