We can use the Heisenberg uncertainty principle to determine the fundamental accuracy with which the position and speed of the electron can be measured simultaneously:

Δx * Δp >= h/4π

where Δx is the uncertainty in position, Δp is the uncertainty in momentum (which is mv for a non-relativistic particle), and h is Planck's constant.

We can use the relationship between momentum and velocity (p = mv) to write:

Δx * Δv * m >= h/4π

where Δv is the uncertainty in velocity, and m is the mass of the electron.

We are given the velocity of the electron as 300 m/s with an uncertainty of 0.01%. This means:

Δv = 0.01% * 300 m/s = 0.03 m/s

We can substitute the given values, solve for Δx, and convert the result to millimeters:

Δx = h/4πΔv* m
Δx = (6.6 * 10^(-34) J s)/(4π * 0.03 m/s * 9.1 * 10^(-31) kg)
Δx = 2.4 * 10^(-7) m
Δx = 0.24 mm (to 2 decimal places)

Therefore, the fundamental accuracy with which the position of the electron can be determined simultaneously with the speed is 0.24 mm.
