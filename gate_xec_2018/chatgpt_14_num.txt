There is no figure provided. The formula for the overall Young's modulus of a unidirectional fiber-reinforced composite is given by:

E_c = V_f * E_f + V_m * E_m

Where:
E_c = Young's modulus of the composite
V_f = Volume fraction of the fiber
E_f = Young's modulus of the fiber
V_m = Volume fraction of the matrix
E_m = Young's modulus of the matrix

Plugging in the values given:

E_c = (0.6 * 200 GPa) + (0.4 * 10 GPa) = 124 GPa

Therefore, the Young's modulus of the composite is 124 GPa. 

Answer: 
- 124 GPa
