We can use Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle to solve this problem. The Uncertainty Principle is given by:

Δx * Δp ≥ h / (2π)

Here, Δx is the uncertainty in position, Δp is the uncertainty in momentum, and h is the Planck's constant. We are given the Planck's constant h and the mass of the electron. We are also given the speed of the electron and its uncertainty as a percentage.

First, we need to find the uncertainty in momentum (Δp). We can calculate this by using the mass and speed of the electron:

Δp = m * Δv

where m is the mass of the electron, and Δv is the uncertainty in speed.

The speed of the electron is given as 300 m/s with an uncertainty of 0.01%. Therefore, the uncertainty in speed can be calculated as:

Δv = 0.01% * 300 m/s = 0.0001 * 300 m/s = 0.03 m/s

Now we can calculate the uncertainty in momentum:

Δp = (9.1 * 10^(-31) kg) * (0.03 m/s) = 2.73 * 10^(-32) kg m/s

Now we can use the Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle equation to find the uncertainty in position (Δx):

Δx = h / (2π * Δp)

Plugging in the values, we get:

Δx = (6.6 * 10^(-34) Js) / (2π * 2.73 * 10^(-32) kg m/s)
Δx = (6.6 * 10^(-34) Js) / (5.46 * π * 10^(-32) kg m/s)

To get the final answer in mm, we need first to solve for Δx in meters and then convert it to mm:

Δx ≈ 3.84 * 10^(-4) m

Now, convert to mm:

Δx ≈ 3.84 * 10^(-4) m * 1000 mm/m ≈ 0.384 mm

Finally, rounding up to 2 decimal places, we get:

Δx ≈ 0.38 mm

The fundamental accuracy with which the position of the electron can be determined simultaneously with the speed in the same experiment is approximately 0.38 mm.

So, the answer in the list is:

[0.38]
