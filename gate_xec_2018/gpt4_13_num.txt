To find the fracture stress, we can use the formula for fracture toughness in terms of stress and crack length:

$K_{1C} = \sigma \times \sqrt{\pi\times a}$

Where:
- $K_{1C}$ is the fracture toughness (25 MPaâˆšm)
- $\sigma$ is the fracture stress (in MPa)
- $a$ is the crack length (2 mm, or 0.002 m, as we should use meters in the formula)

Rearranging the formula to solve for $\sigma$, we get:

$\sigma = \frac{K_{1C}}{\sqrt{\pi\times a}}$

Now, we can plug in the given values for fracture toughness and crack length:

$\sigma = \frac{25}{\sqrt{\pi\times 0.002}}$

Calculate the value of $\sigma$:

$\sigma = \frac{25}{\sqrt{\pi\times 0.002}} \approx 1000.12$

Rounding off to the nearest whole number, we get:

$\sigma \approx 1000$ MPa

So, the fracture stress is approximately 1000 MPa. The answer is [1000].
