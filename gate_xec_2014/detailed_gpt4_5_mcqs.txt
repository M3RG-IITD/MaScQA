To solve this question, let's first understand the terms given in the options and then determine which one refers to the antiferromagnetic-to-paramagnetic transition temperature.

A) Curie temperature: The Curie temperature (Tc) is the critical temperature at which a ferromagnetic material loses its ferromagnetic property and becomes paramagnetic. This is not the correct answer, as the question asks for the transition between antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic states.

B) Curie-Weiss temperature: The Curie-Weiss temperature (θ) is a parameter used in the Curie-Weiss law to describe the relationship between the magnetic susceptibility and temperature of a paramagnetic material. This is not the correct answer, as this temperature specifically relates to paramagnetism and not a transition between antiferromagnetism and paramagnetism.

C) Neel temperature: The Neel temperature (TN) is the critical temperature at which an antiferromagnetic material undergoes a phase transition and becomes paramagnetic. This is the correct answer, as it describes the transition temperature between the antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic states.

D) Debye temperature: The Debye temperature (ΘD) is a characteristic temperature of solids used in the Debye model of solids, relating to their heat capacity and vibrational modes. This temperature is not related to magnetic transitions.

So the correct answer is C) Neel temperature.

The final answer is [C].
