We know that the molecular weight ($M_n$) of polymerized isotactic polybutadiene is 3 x $10^5$ g/mol.

The molecular weight ($M_n$) of a polymer can be related to the degree of polymerization ($DP$) with the following equation:

$M_n = DP \times M_u$

Where $M_u$ is the molecular weight of the repeating unit.

Since the only unknown in this equation is $DP$, we can rearrange it to solve for $DP$:

$DP = \frac{M_n}{M_u}$

To find $DP$, we need to know the molecular weight of the repeating unit for isotactic polybutadiene. The repeating unit for polybutadiene is:

CH$_2$ - CH = CH - CH$_2$

The molecular weight of this repeating unit is:

(2 x 12.01 g/mol) + (4 x 1.01 g/mol) = 54.06 g/mol

Now we can substitute the known values into the equation for $DP$:

$DP = \frac{3 \times 10^5 \text{ g/mol}}{54.06 \text{ g/mol}} = 5556$

Therefore, the degree of polymerization of isotactic polybutadiene is 5556.
