The correct answer is (C) Neel temperature. 

Explanation: 

Antiferromagnetism is a phenomenon that occurs in some materials where the spins of neighboring atoms align in an alternating pattern, causing the material to have a net spin of zero. At low temperatures, these materials are antiferromagnetic, but at a certain temperature, called the Neel temperature, they become paramagnetic. 

The Neel temperature is named after Louis Neel, a French physicist who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1970 for his work on magnetism. It is the temperature at which the magnetic moments of the atoms in an antiferromagnetic material undergo a phase transition, becoming disordered and producing a net magnetic moment. 

The Curie temperature, on the other hand, is the temperature at which a ferromagnetic material loses its ferromagnetic properties and becomes paramagnetic. It is named after Pierre Curie, a French physicist who discovered paramagnetism and diamagnetism along with his wife Marie Curie. 

The Curie-Weiss temperature is a parameter used in the Curie-Weiss law, which describes the behavior of the susceptibility of a ferromagnetic material as a function of temperature. 

The Debye temperature is also a parameter used in materials science, but it describes the characteristic energy of atomic vibrations in a crystal lattice.
