We can use the Arrhenius equation to relate the diffusion coefficients to the activation energy:
D = D0 exp(-Q/RT)
where
D is the diffusion coefficient
D0 is a constant pre-exponential factor
Q is the activation energy
R is the gas constant
T is the temperature in Kelvin

We can first calculate the ratio of the diffusion coefficients:
D(550°C)/D(500°C) = (5.8*10^(-13))/(1.9*10^(-13)) = 3.05

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides of the Arrhenius equation, we get:
ln(D/D0) = -Q/RT

We can now apply this equation to both temperatures:
ln(D(500°C)/D0) = -Q/(R*773 K)
ln(D(550°C)/D0) = -Q/(R*823 K)

We can then subtract the second equation from the first one:
ln(D(500°C)/D0) - ln(D(550°C)/D0) = Q/R (1/773 K - 1/823 K)

Using the logarithmic rule ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b), we can simplify the left-hand side:
ln(D(500°C)/D(550°C)) = Q/R (1/773 K - 1/823 K)

We have already calculated the ratio of the diffusion coefficients, so we can substitute it in:
ln(1/3.05) = Q/R (1/773 K - 1/823 K)

Solving for Q, we get:
Q = -R ln(1/3.05) / (1/773 K - 1/823 K) = 69.3 kJ/mol

Therefore, the activation energy for diffusion of Mg in Al is 69.3 kJ/mol.

Answer: [69.3 kJ/mol]
