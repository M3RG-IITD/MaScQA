To find the degree of polymerization, we first need to know the molecular weight of the monomer unit of isotactic polybutadiene. Isotactic polybutadiene has the structure:

```
CH2=CH-CH=CH-CH2-CH=CH-CH=CH-CH2
```

The molecular weight of this monomer unit can be calculated as:

```
(4 x 12.01 g/mol) + (6 x 1.01 g/mol) = 54.06 g/mol
```

The degree of polymerization (DP) is defined as the number of monomer units in the polymer chain. It can be calculated as:

```
DP = (molecular weight of polymer)/(molecular weight of monomer unit)
DP = (3 x 10^5 g/mol)/(54.06 g/mol)
DP = 5546.65
```

Therefore, the degree of polymerization of isotactic polybutadiene is approximately 5547.

Answer: 

- 5547
