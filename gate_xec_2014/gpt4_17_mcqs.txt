To solve this problem, we can use the Rydberg formula for the energy difference between two energy levels of the hydrogen atom:

ΔE = -13.6 eV * (1/nf^2 - 1/ni^2)

where nf and ni are the final and initial energy levels, respectively. In this case, nf = 2 and ni = 4.

ΔE = -13.6 * (1/2^2 - 1/4^2)
ΔE = -13.6 * (1/4 - 1/16)
ΔE = -13.6 * (12/64)
ΔE = -2.55 eV

So, the energy difference is 2.55 eV (since energy is emitted, the value is positive).

Now, we can use the relationship between energy and wavelength for a photon:

E = (hc) / λ

where E is the energy in electronvolts (eV), h is the Planck's constant (4.1357 × 10^(-15) eV·s), c is the speed of light (3 × 10^8 m/s), and λ is the wavelength in meters.

We know that E = 2.55 eV, so we can solve for λ:

2.55 eV = (4.1357 × 10^(-15) eV·s * 3 × 10^8 m/s) / λ
λ = (4.1357 × 10^(-15) * 3 × 10^8) / 2.55
λ = 4.8733 × 10^(-7) m

To convert the wavelength to μm, we divide by 10^(-6):

λ = 4.8733 × 10^(-7) / 10^(-6)
λ = 0.487 μm

So, the correct answer is (D) 2.55 eV and 0.487 μm: [2.55, 0.487]
