Answer: (D) Atomic force microscopy.

Step-by-step explanation:

To measure the roughness of a polysilicon wafer, we need a high-resolution imaging technique that can provide surface topographical information. Among the options given, atomic force microscopy (AFM) is the most appropriate technique for this purpose. Here's why:

A) Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) relies on the quantum tunneling of electrons between a conductive probe and the sample surface to obtain an image. While STM can provide atomic-scale information about the sample, it requires the sample to be conductive and in a vacuum. Polysilicon wafers are typically not conductive, and STM cannot be used under ambient conditions.

B) Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) uses a focused beam of electrons to scan the surface of a sample and produce an image. While SEM has high resolution and can be used with non-conductive samples, it does not provide direct height information and is more suitable for imaging the morphology and composition of surfaces rather than their roughness.

C) Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) uses a beam of electrons transmitted through a thin sample to obtain information about its structure and composition. TEM can provide atomic-scale information about the sample, but it is not suitable for imaging large areas of a sample surface, and requires extremely thin samples that may not be representative of the entire wafer.

D) Atomic force microscopy (AFM) uses a sharp probe attached to a cantilever to scan the surface of a sample and detect variations in the surface height. AFM can produce high-resolution images of large areas of a sample surface, is suitable for both conductive and non-conductive samples, and can provide quantitative information about the roughness of a surface.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) atomic force microscopy.
