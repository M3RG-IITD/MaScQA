To find the weight of gallium to be mixed with arsenic to form 1 kg of gallium arsenide (GaAs), we need to first find the mass fractions of gallium and arsenic in GaAs.

1. Find the molar mass of GaAs:
M(GaAs) = M(Ga) + M(As) = 69.72 g/mol + 74.92 g/mol = 144.64 g/mol

2. Calculate the mass fractions of gallium and arsenic in GaAs:
Mass fraction of Ga = M(Ga) / M(GaAs) = 69.72 g/mol / 144.64 g/mol ≈ 0.4819
Mass fraction of As = M(As) / M(GaAs) = 74.92 g/mol / 144.64 g/mol ≈ 0.5181

3. To find the mass of gallium and arsenic needed to form 1 kg of GaAs, multiply the mass fractions by the total desired mass (1 kg or 1000 g):
Mass of Ga = (0.4819)(1000 g) ≈ 481.9 g
Mass of As = (0.5181)(1000 g) ≈ 518.1 g

4. Convert the mass of gallium to kg:
Mass of Ga = 481.9 g * (1 kg / 1000 g) = 0.4819 kg

The weight in kilograms of gallium needed to be mixed with arsenic to obtain 1.0 kg of gallium arsenide (GaAs) is approximately 0.4819 kg.

The answer is [0.4819].
