To answer this question, let's first review some concepts related to p-n junctions and carrier concentrations.

A p-n junction is formed when a p-type semiconductor (high density of holes as majority carriers) is in direct contact with an n-type semiconductor (high density of electrons as majority carriers). The region around the junction is called the depletion region, where the majority carriers from the p and n sides recombine with each other, leaving ionized donor and acceptor atoms behind.

When a voltage is applied across the p-n junction in the forward bias condition, the p side is connected to the positive terminal and the n side is connected to the negative terminal. Under this condition, the majority carriers from both sides move toward the depletion region and are driven by the electric field created by the voltage applied. When these carriers diffuse across the junction, they become minority carriers in the opposite type of material.

Low injection level refers to a condition where only a small amount of external energy or voltage is applied to the junction. This means that the carrier injection and charge carrier concentration do not drastically change from their equilibrium values. In this situation, the majority carrier concentrations are still much higher than the minority carrier concentrations in each type of the material.

Now, let's go through the given options:

(A) No charge carriers: This option is incorrect because there are always some charge carriers (majority and minority) in both the p and n regions.

(B) Minority carrier concentration much more than majority carrier concentration: This option is also incorrect because, as mentioned earlier, the majority carrier concentrations are still much higher than the minority carrier concentrations under the low injection level condition.

(C) Minority carrier concentration equal to majority carrier concentration: This option is not correct either, since majority and minority carrier concentrations are not equal in a p-n junction under any biasing condition.

(D) Minority carrier concentration much less than majority carrier concentration: This option is correct because, under a low injection level, the majority carrier concentrations are much higher than the minority carrier concentrations in both the p and n materials.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
