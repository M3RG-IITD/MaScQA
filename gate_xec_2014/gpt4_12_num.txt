Let the final temperature of the mixture be Tf.

The equation for heat exchange can be written as:
Heat gained by cold water + Heat gained by the cup = Heat lost by hot water
Let's denote the mass of cold water as mc and the mass of hot water as mh. 

mc * cw * (Tf - Tc) + mcup * ccup * (Tf - Tc) = mh * cw * (Th - Tf)

Plugging in the given values:
80 g * 4.18 J/g°C * (Tf - 4°C) + 140 g * 0.385 J/g°C * (Tf - 4°C) = 100 g * 4.18 J/g°C * (90°C - Tf)

Expanding and simplifying the equation:
334.4 Tf - 1337.6 + 53.9 Tf - 215.6 = 4180 - 41.8 Tf

Combine the terms:
334.4 Tf + 53.9 Tf + 41.8 Tf = 1337.6 + 215.6 + 4180
429.1 Tf = 5733.2

Now solve for Tf:
Tf = 5733.2 / 429.1
Tf ≈ 13.35°C

So, the final temperature of water is approximately 13.35°C.

Answer: [13.35]
