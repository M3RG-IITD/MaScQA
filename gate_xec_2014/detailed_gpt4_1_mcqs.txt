Neoprene, also known as polychloroprene, is a synthetic rubber produced by the polymerization of chloroprene. It is used in various applications due to its excellent properties, such as resistance to solvents, oils, weathering, and flame. In this question, we are asked to determine the reason behind the non-inflammable characteristic of neoprene.

Let's analyze each option.

(A) It has a highly cross-linked structure:
Crosslinking is a process of bonding between polymer chains, which affects the mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties of the material. While a highly cross-linked structure can improve the physical properties of a polymer, it is not the main reason for neoprene's non-inflammability.

(B) It has a highly linear chain structure:
A linear chain structure generally refers to a polymer having no branches or cross-linking between its chains. This structure does not directly contribute to neoprene's non-inflammability. Neoprene actually has some cross-linking, but it is not considered as a highly linear chain polymer.

(C) Of the presence of chlorine atom in the structure:
The presence of a chlorine atom in the structure of neoprene is indeed an important factor in its non-inflammable properties. Chlorine promotes the formation of a char layer on the material's surface, which acts as a barrier during combustion, reducing the amount of heat and oxygen necessary for flame propagation. Additionally, the presence of chlorine in the structure can reduce the rate of thermal degradation and the release of flammable gases during heating.

(D) Of the absence of chlorine atom in the structure: 
This statement is incorrect because neoprene, as polychloroprene, does contain chlorine atoms in its structure.

In conclusion, the primary reason for the non-inflammable characteristic of neoprene is due to the presence of chlorine atoms in its structure (option C).

The answer is [C].
