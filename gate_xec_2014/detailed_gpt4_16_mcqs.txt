To obtain an isomorphous phase diagram in a binary alloy system, certain rules called Hume-Rothery rules need to be satisfied:

1. The atomic size difference should be less than 15% (P)
2. Both the end components should have the same crystal structure (Q)
3. The valency of the end components should either be the same or one should have a higher valency and the other should have a lower valency (R)
4. The end components should have similar electronegativities (not dissimilar, so S is incorrect)

The correct answer is (A) P, Q, and R need to be satisfied for obtaining an isomorphous phase diagram in a binary alloy system.
