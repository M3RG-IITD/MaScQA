To determine which option is correct, let us first see what Nylon-6 is and the process of its manufacturing. 

Nylon-6 (also known as polycaprolactam) is a type of polyamide or nylon. It is a synthetic polymer, produced through a polymerization process called ring-opening polymerization. 

Now let's look into the options mentioned:

(A) Caprolactum:
Caprolactam (C6H11NO) is a cyclic amide (also known as lactam) that acts as a monomer and gets transformed into a linear polymer Nylon-6. The ring-opening polymerization of caprolactam involves breaking the ring and forming a new amide linkage, which then forms chains of the polymer.

(B) Adipic acid and hexamethylene diamine:
This combination is used to produce another type of nylon called Nylon-6,6. Adipic acid (C6H10O4) and hexamethylene diamine (C6H16N2) are combined through a condensation polymerization process, where a water molecule is eliminated, and an amide linkage is formed between the monomers.

(C) Maleic anhydride and hexamethylene diamine:
Maleic anhydride (C4H2O3) reacts with hexamethylene diamine to form a different type of polymer called nylon-6,6-imide, not Nylon-6. The structure and properties of this polymer may vary from those of Nylon-6.

(D) Sebacic acid and hexamethylene diamine:
When sebacic acid (C10H18O4) reacts with hexamethylene diamine, it forms yet another type of nylon known as Nylon-6,10. Similar to Nylon-6,6, the formation of Nylon-6,10 involves the condensation polymerization process.

Based on the information provided, it is safe to conclude that Nylon-6 is manufactured from caprolactum, as it undergoes the ring-opening polymerization process resulting in the formation of Nylon-6 polymer.

Hence, the correct answer is [A].
