To correctly match the composite materials in Column I with their most suitable applications in Column II, we need to understand the properties of each composite material and the requirements for each application. 

Column I:
(P) Glass fibre reinforced plastic (GFRP) - Lightweight, strong, and resistant to corrosion. 
(Q) SiC particle reinforced Al alloy - High strength, stiffness, wear resistance, and thermal stability. 
(R) Carbon-carbon composite - High-temperature resistance, lightweight, and high strength.
(S) Metal fibre reinforced rubber - Improved tensile strength, abrasion resistance, and flexibility.

Column II:
(1) Missile cone heads - Require lightweight, heat-resistant, and high strength materials.
(2) Commercial automobile chassis - Require high-strength, lightweight, and corrosion-resistant materials.
(3) Airplane wheel tyres - Require materials with good tensile strength, abrasion resistance, and flexibility.
(4) Car piston rings - Need high strength, wear resistance, and thermal stability. 
(5) High-performance skateboards - Require lightweight, strong, and corrosion-resistant materials.

Now let's try to match the materials with the applications:

(P) GFRP - Its lightweight, strong, and corrosion-resistant properties make it suitable for high-performance skateboards. So, P matches with 5.

(Q) SiC particle reinforced Al alloy - High strength, wear resistance, and thermal stability make this material suitable for car piston rings. So, Q matches with 4.

(R) Carbon-carbon composite - High-temperature resistance, lightweight, and high strength properties make this material well-suited for missile cone heads. So, R matches with 1.

(S) Metal fibre reinforced rubber - Improved tensile strength, abrasion resistance, and flexibility make this material suitable for airplane wheel tyres. So, S matches with 3.

Thus, the correct matching is P-5, Q-4, R-1, S-3, which corresponds to option (C).
