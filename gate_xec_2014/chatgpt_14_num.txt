We can use the rule of mixtures to solve this problem. According to this rule, the effective modulus of the composite is given by:

E_composite = V_fiber * E_fiber + V_matrix * E_matrix

where:

V_fiber = volume fraction of fibers
V_matrix = volume fraction of matrix
E_fiber = Young's modulus of the fiber
E_matrix = Young's modulus of the matrix

We can rearrange this equation to solve for V_fiber:

V_fiber = (E_composite - V_matrix * E_matrix) / E_fiber

Substituting the given values:

E_composite = 185 GPa
E_fiber = 360 GPa
E_matrix = 110 GPa

We still need to determine V_matrix. Since we are dealing with a unidirectional fiber composite, we can assume that the fibers are aligned in one direction and the matrix fills the space between them. Therefore:

V_fiber + V_matrix = 1

We can rearrange this equation to solve for V_matrix:

V_matrix = 1 - V_fiber

Substituting this into the first equation, we get:

E_composite = V_fiber * E_fiber + (1 - V_fiber) * E_matrix

Simplifying:

E_composite = V_fiber * (E_fiber - E_matrix) + E_matrix

Solving for V_fiber:

V_fiber = (E_composite - E_matrix) / (E_fiber - E_matrix)

Substituting the given values:

V_fiber = (185 - 110) / (360 - 110) = 0.433

Therefore, the volume fraction of fibers in the composite is:

- 0.433

Answer: 

- 0.433
