To find the weight in kg of gallium, we need to first calculate the molar mass of gallium arsenide (GaAs):

Molar mass of GaAs = (1 x M(Ga)) + (1 x M(As))

Molar mass of GaAs = (1 x 69.72 g/mol) + (1 x 74.92 g/mol)

Molar mass of GaAs = 144.64 g/mol

Now we can find the amount of gallium needed to make 1 kg of GaAs:

Amount of Ga = (M(Ga) / M(GaAs)) x 1 kg

Amount of Ga = (69.72 g/mol / 144.64 g/mol) x 1 kg

Amount of Ga = 0.481 kg or 481 g

Therefore, the weight in kg of gallium needed to make 1 kg of gallium arsenide is:

- 0.481 kg
