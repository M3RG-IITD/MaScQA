We can use the Arrhenius equation to relate the diffusion coefficients to temperature and activation energy:

$D = D_0 e^{-Q/RT}$

where:
- $D$ is the diffusion coefficient
- $D_0$ is a constant pre-exponential factor
- $Q$ is the activation energy
- $R$ is the gas constant
- $T$ is the absolute temperature

We can solve for $Q$ by taking the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation and manipulating it:

$\ln(D/D_0) = -Q/RT$

$Q = -\ln(D/D_0) RT$

We can use the given diffusion coefficients and temperature to find $Q$ at each temperature, and then calculate the difference between the two:

$Q_{diff} = -\ln(D_{550}/D_{500}) RT$

$Q_{diff} = -\ln(5.8*10^(-13)/1.9*10^(-13)) (8.31 J/mol K) ((550+273) - (500+273)) K$

$Q_{diff} = 103.3 kJ/mol$

Therefore, the activation energy for diffusion of Mg in Al is 103.3 kJ/mol.

Answer: 
- 103.3 kJ/mol
