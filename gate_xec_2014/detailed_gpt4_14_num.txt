To solve this problem, we'll use the rule of mixtures for the Young's modulus of a unidirectional composite. The rule of mixtures states that:

E_c = V_f * E_f + V_m * E_m

where:
E_c is the Young's modulus of the composite
V_f is the volume fraction of the fibers
E_f is the Young's modulus of the fibers
V_m is the volume fraction of the matrix
E_m is the Young's modulus of the matrix

In this problem, we are given the following:

E_c = 185 GPa
E_f = 360 GPa (SiC fibers)
E_m = 110 GPa (Ti matrix)

The volume fractions of the fibers and the matrix must add up to 1, so we can write:

V_m = 1 - V_f

We can now substitute this expression for V_m into the rule of mixtures equation:

E_c = V_f * E_f + (1 - V_f) * E_m

Next, we'll solve for V_f. First, substitute the given values for E_c, E_f, and E_m:

185 GPa = V_f * 360 GPa + (1 - V_f) * 110 GPa

Now, we'll solve for V_f:

185 GPa = 360 GPa * V_f + 110 GPa - 110 GPa * V_f
75 GPa = 250 GPa * V_f

Divide both sides by 250 GPa:

V_f = 75 GPa / 250 GPa 
V_f â‰ˆ 0.3

The volume fraction of fibers in the composite is approximately 0.3 or 30%.

The correct answer is [0.3].
