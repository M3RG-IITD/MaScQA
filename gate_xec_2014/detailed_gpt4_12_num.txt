Let's first understand the given data:

- Copper cup mass: mc = 140 g
- Copper cup initial temperature: Tc_initial = 4 °C
- Water's mass inside the copper cup: mw1 = 80 g
- Water's initial temperature inside the copper cup: Tw1_initial = 4 °C
- Water's mass added to the cup: mw2 = 100 g
- Water's initial temperature added to the cup: Tw2_initial = 90 °C
- Specific heat capacity of water: Sw = 4.18 J/g°C
- Specific heat capacity of copper: Sc = 0.385 J/g°C

We want to find the final temperature of the whole system (water and copper cup) when both bodies reach thermal equilibrium. Let's call this final temperature T_final.

When water is added to the cup, heat energy transfer will occur until they reach an equilibrium. We can set up an equation based on the conservation of energy: heat gained by the cold bodies (copper cup and water inside the cup) equals heat lost by the hot body (added water).

(mc * Sc * (T_final - Tc_initial)) + (mw1 * Sw * (T_final - Tw1_initial)) = (mw2 * Sw * (Tw2_initial - T_final))

Now, substitute the given data into the equation:

(140 * 0.385 * (T_final - 4)) + (80 * 4.18 * (T_final - 4)) = (100 * 4.18 * (90 - T_final))

Simplify the equation:

53.9 * (T_final - 4) + 334.4 * (T_final - 4) = 418 * (90 - T_final)

Combine terms:

53.9T_final - 215.6 + 334.4T_final - 1337.6 = 37620 - 418T_final

Add all T_final terms on one side:

806.3T_final = 37620 + 1553.2

Solve for T_final:

T_final = (37620 + 1553.2) / 806.3
T_final ≈ 44.5 °C

So, the final temperature of water in the copper cup when thermal equilibrium is reached is approximately 44.5 °C. The correct answer can be written as [44.5].
