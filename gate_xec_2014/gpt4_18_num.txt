First, we need to find the molar ratio of Ga and As in GaAs.

In one molecule of GaAs, there is 1 mole of Ga and 1 mole of As.

Now we need to find the mass ratio of Ga and As in GaAs.

Mass of Ga in 1 mole of GaAs = $M_(Ga)$ = 69.72 g/mol
Mass of As in 1 mole of GaAs = $M_(As)$ = 74.92 g/mol

Total mass of GaAs = Mass of Ga + Mass of As = 69.72 g/mol + 74.92 g/mol = 144.64 g/mol

Now we find the weight fraction of Ga in GaAs.

Weight fraction of Ga in GaAs = $\frac{Mass\:of\:Ga}{Total\:mass\:of\:GaAs}$ = $\frac{69.72}{144.64}$ = 0.4820

Now we can find the weight (in kg) of Ga required to obtain 1.0 kg of GaAs.

Weight of Ga = Weight fraction of Ga in GaAs × 1.0 kg = 0.4820 × 1.0 kg = 0.482 kg

So, the required weight of Ga is 0.482 kg.

The correct answer is [0.482].
