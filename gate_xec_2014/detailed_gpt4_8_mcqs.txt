To determine how the equilibrium concentration of vacancies in a pure metal varies with temperature, we need to consider the relationship between the formation energy of vacancies, the Boltzmann constant, and temperature. 

The equilibrium concentration of vacancies (N_v) is given by the Arrhenius equation:

N_v = N * exp(-E_f / (k * T))

Here, 
N is the total number of atomic sites,
E_f is the vacancy formation energy,
k is the Boltzmann constant, and
T is the temperature in Kelvin.

From the equation, we can observe that N_v depends on the temperature and the formation energy of vacancies, and is inversely proportional to the temperature.

As T increases, the term (-E_f / (k * T)) will become smaller, making the exponential term exp(-E_f / (k * T)) larger. Thus, the equilibrium concentration of vacancies increases as the temperature tends to increase.

The inverse proportionality between N_v and T can be concluded as an exponential increase in N_v with increasing T.

Hence, the correct answer is:

(A) increases exponentially with temperature
