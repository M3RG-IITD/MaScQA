The correct answer cannot be any of the options given, because they all have incorrect units or incorrect values. The typical barrier potential for a silicon p-n junction at room temperature is approximately 0.7 volts (V), which is a standard value widely used in the electronics industry. 

The explanation for this is based on the way that p-n junctions work. A p-n junction is formed by bringing together a p-type semiconductor (which has an excess of positively charged holes) and an n-type semiconductor (which has an excess of negatively charged electrons). When the two regions are put together, the excess carriers diffuse across the junction and create a depletion region in which there are very few free carriers.

In order to overcome the built-in potential of this depletion region and make any current flow through the junction, an external voltage must be applied. This external voltage, which is typically referred to as the forward bias voltage, must be greater than the barrier potential that exists across the junction in its natural state.

For a silicon p-n junction, the typical barrier potential is approximately 0.7 V at room temperature (which is usually defined as 25Â°C or 298 K). This value can be estimated using the following formula: 

V_b = (kT/q) * ln(N_aN_d/n_i^2)

where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, q is the elementary charge, N_a and N_d are the doping densities of the p and n regions, and n_i is the intrinsic carrier concentration of the semiconductor material.

Assuming typical doping densities and intrinsic carrier concentrations for silicon (which are on the order of 10^16 to 10^19/cm^3), the value of the logarithm term in this equation is approximately 3, which means that the barrier potential is on the order of a few tenths of a volt.

Therefore, the correct answer is: 

- 0.7 V
