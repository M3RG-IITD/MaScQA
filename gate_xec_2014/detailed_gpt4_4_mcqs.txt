Polysilicon wafer roughness can be determined by analyzing the surface topology and features at a nanoscale level. Different types of microscopy techniques are available for this purpose, but some are more appropriate for measuring surface roughness than others. Let's briefly discuss each of the given microscopy techniques and their relevance to surface roughness measurements:

(A) Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM):
STM is a powerful technique used for imaging surfaces at the atomic level. It's based on the quantum mechanical phenomenon called tunneling, where electrons move through a barrier that classical mechanics would predict to be insurmountable. In STM, a sharp metallic tip is brought close to the sample surface, and a bias voltage is applied between the tip and the sample. When the tip is very close to the surface, the electrons can tunnel from the sample to the tip (or vice versa), creating a current that can be measured. The tunneling current is highly sensitive to the distance between the tip and the surface, so by scanning the tip across the surface and measuring the current, we can obtain topographic information about the surface down to the atomic scale. Thus, STM can be used to measure the roughness of a polysilicon wafer.

(B) Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM):
SEM is another powerful microscopy technique that is widely used for imaging surfaces. It involves scanning a focused beam of electrons across a sample surface, detecting the generated secondary electrons, and creating an image based on these signals. Although SEM has a high resolution and can reveal surface features at a nanoscale level, it is not as precise as STM or AFM for measuring surface roughness due to depth of field limitations.

(C) Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM):
TEM involves transmitting an electron beam through a thin specimen and measuring the resulting diffracted and transmitted electrons. It can provide high-resolution images of the internal structure of a material, but it is not suitable for evaluating surface roughness since it requires the sample to be thin enough for the electrons to pass through entirely.

(D) Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM):
AFM is a high-resolution microscopy technique that measures the topographical features of the sample surface at the atomic scale by using a sharp tip mounted on a flexible cantilever. AFM measures the deflection of the cantilever caused by interactions between the tip and the surface (including Van der Waals, electrostatic, and magnetic forces). This deflection is detected by a laser that reflects off the cantilever and onto a photodetector, using feedback to maintain a constant force or deflection on the tip as it scans across the surface. AFM enables precise and direct measurement of surface roughness and is well-suited for analyzing the roughness of a polysilicon wafer.

In conclusion, among the given techniques, the most suitable methods for quantitative measurement of the roughness of a polysilicon wafer are:

- (A) Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM)
- (D) Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)
