To solve this question, we need to understand the properties of each material in Column I and match them with the appropriate property in Column II. 

Column I:
(P) Pb(Zr,Ti)$O_3$ - This is Lead Zirconate Titanate, also known as PZT. It is a widely used piezoelectric ceramic material. Piezoelectric materials show a change in their polarization with an applied mechanical stress or a change in stress upon an applied electric field.

(Q) Ni$_(50)Ti_(50)$ - This is a Nickel-Titanium alloy, also known as Nitinol, with a composition of 50% Nickel and 50% Titanium. Nitinol exhibits shape memory behavior, which means when it is deformed, it can return to its original shape after heating.

(R) GaAs - This is Gallium Arsenide, a III-V compound semiconductor with properties well-suited for optoelectronic devices, such as LEDs and solar cells.

(S) $YBa_2Cu_3O_7$ - This is Yttrium Barium Copper Oxide, also known as a "YBCO" material. It is a high-temperature superconductor, which means it has no electrical resistance above a particular temperature (critical temperature).

Now, let's match the materials in Column I to their properties in Column II:

(P) Pb(Zr,Ti)$O_3$ matches with (2) Piezoelectric ceramic
(Q) Ni$_(50)Ti_(50)$ matches with (1) Shape memory alloy
(R) GaAs matches with (4) Optoelectronic semiconductor
(S) $YBa_2Cu_3O_7$ matches with (3) High temperature superconductor

So, the correct option is (D) P-2, Q-1, R-4, S-3.
