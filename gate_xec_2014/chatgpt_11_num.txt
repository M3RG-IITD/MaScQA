Firstly, we need to calculate the stress at the point of failure. 
yield strength = 880 MPa 
Applying strain = 0.108, 
stress = yield strength = 880 MPa 

The strain energy density stored in a material is given by the area under the stress-strain curve up to the point of failure. 

Strain energy density = (1/2)*stress*strain 

Substituting the values, we get: 
Strain energy density = (1/2)*880*10^6 *0.108 

= 4.27456 x 10^7 J/m^3 

1 MJ/$m^3$ = 10^6 J/m^3 
Therefore, Strain energy density = 42.75 MJ/$m^3$ 

Answer: 
The mechanical energy necessary to break the material is 42.75 MJ/$m^3$
