At low injection level, a forward biased p-n junction would have minority carrier concentration much less than majority carrier concentration.

Explanation:

When a p-n junction is forward biased, the electrons from the n-side and holes from the p-side move towards the junction region. At low injection levels, only a small number of electrons and holes cross the junction region. Therefore, the majority carriers (which are the electrons in n-type and holes in p-type) still dominate the junction region.

However, some minority carriers (which are the holes in n-type and electrons in p-type) are also injected into the junction region. The concentration of these minority carriers is still much less than the majority carriers, as the injection level is low.

Therefore, the correct answer is option (D) minority carrier concentration much less than majority carrier concentration.

List of correct answer: 
- (D) minority carrier concentration much less than majority carrier concentration
