To calculate the degree of polymerization, we need to know two things:

1. The molecular weight of the polymer (polymerized isotactic polybutadiene), which is given as 3 x $10^5$ g/mol.
2. The molecular weight of the monomer (butadiene).

First, let's determine the molecular weight of butadiene (C4H6). The molecular weight of carbon (C) is 12.01 g/mol, and the molecular weight of hydrogen (H) is 1.008 g/mol.

The molecular weight of butadiene can be calculated as follows:

Molecular weight of butadiene = (number of carbon atoms x molecular weight of carbon) + (number of hydrogen atoms x molecular weight of hydrogen)

Molecular weight of butadiene = (4 x 12.01 g/mol) + (6 x 1.008 g/mol)
Molecular weight of butadiene = 48.04 g/mol + 6.048 g/mol
Molecular weight of butadiene = 54.088 g/mol

Now we can calculate the degree of polymerization using the molecular weight of the polymer and the molecular weight of the monomer:

Degree of polymerization (Xn) = (Molecular weight of polymer) / (Molecular weight of monomer)

Degree of polymerization (Xn) = (3 x $10^5$ g/mol) / (54.088 g/mol)

Degree of polymerization (Xn) â‰ˆ 5546

The degree of polymerization of polymerized isotactic polybutadiene is approximately 5546.

Correct answer: [5546]
