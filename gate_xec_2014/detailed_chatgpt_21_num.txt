To solve this problem, we will use Bragg's law: 

nλ = 2dsinθ

where n is the order of diffraction (in this case, n = 1), λ is the wavelength of the radiation (0.1542 nm), d is the interplanar spacing, and θ is the diffraction angle we are trying to find.

To find d for the (113) planes of face-centered cubic Pt, we can use the formula:

d = a / √(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)

where a is the lattice parameter (0.392 nm), and h, k, and l are the Miller indices for the set of planes we are interested in (113):

d = 0.392 nm / √(1^2 + 1^2 + 3^2) = 0.136 nm

Now we can use Bragg's law to find θ:

sinθ = nλ / 2d = (1)(0.1542 nm) / (2)(0.136 nm) = 0.566

θ = sin⁻¹(0.566) = 34.6°

Therefore, the expected diffraction angle for the first order reflection from the (113) set of planes for face centered cubic Pt using monochromatic radiation of wavelength 0.1542 nm is 34.6°.

Answer: [34.6°]
