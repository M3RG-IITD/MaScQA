The given question is asking about the matching of reactions and their names.

(P) L on cooling gives α + β - This represents a reaction where a liquid phase on cooling forms two different solid solution phases, α and β.

(Q) L + β on cooling gives γ - This represents a reaction where a liquid phase on cooling mixes with a solid phase to form a different solid solution phase, γ.

(R) α on cooling gives β - This represents a reaction where a solid solution phase α on cooling transforms into a different solid solution phase β.

Now, let's come to the names mentioned in the second column.

(1) Peritectic - This represents a reaction where a liquid phase reacts with the solid phase to form a new solid phase.

(2) Eutectic - This represents a reaction where a mixture of two solid phases melts to form a liquid phase.

(3) Monotectic - This represents a reaction where a liquid phase on cooling separates into two liquid phases.

(4) Eutectoid - This represents a reaction where a solid phase on cooling transforms into two different solid phases.

Now, let's match them together.

(P) L on cooling gives α + β - This represents a eutectoid reaction where a liquid phase on cooling forms two different solid solution phases, α and β. Therefore, option (D) is eliminated.

(Q) L + β on cooling gives γ - This represents a peritectic reaction where a liquid phase on cooling mixes with a solid phase to form a different solid solution phase, γ.

(R) α on cooling gives β - This represents a eutectoid reaction where a solid solution phase α on cooling transforms into a different solid solution phase β.

Therefore, the correct matching is:

(P) - Eutectoid

(Q) - Peritectic

(R) - Eutectoid

Hence, the correct option is (A) P-1, Q-4, R-3.
