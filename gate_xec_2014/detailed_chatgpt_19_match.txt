(P) Pb(Zr,Ti)$O_3$ is a piezoelectric ceramic, as it has the ability to generate an electrical charge in response to mechanical stress.

(Q) Ni$_{50}$Ti$_{50}$ is a shape memory alloy, meaning that it can be deformed at one temperature and will return to its original shape when heated to a certain temperature.

(R) GaAs is an optoelectronic semiconductor, as it can be used in devices that convert electrical energy to light or vice versa.

(S) $YBa_2Cu_3O_7$ is a high temperature superconductor, which means that it can conduct electric current without any resistance at relatively high temperatures.

Therefore, the correct matching between the material in Column I and the property in Column II are:

(A) P-2, Q-1, R-4, S-3.
