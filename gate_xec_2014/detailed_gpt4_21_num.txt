To solve this problem, we'll use Bragg's Law, which relates the angle of reflection to the interplanar distance (d-spacing) and the wavelength of the radiation. Bragg's Law is given by:

nλ = 2d * sinθ

where:
- n is the order of reflection (in this case, n = 1 for first order)
- λ is the wavelength of the radiation (in this case, λ = 0.1542 nm)
- d is the interplanar distance
- θ is the angle of reflection (the value we want to calculate)

First, we need to find the interplanar distance (d-spacing) for the (113) set of planes in a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice. To do this, we'll use the formula for d-spacing in a cubic lattice:

d = (a) / sqrt(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)

where:
- a is the lattice parameter (in this case, a = 0.392 nm)
- h, k, and l are the Miller indices for the set of planes (in this case, h = 1, k = 1, and l = 3)

Plug in the values into the d-spacing formula:

d = (0.392 nm) / sqrt((1)^2 + (1)^2 + (3)^2)
d = (0.392 nm) / sqrt(1 + 1 + 9)
d = (0.392 nm) / sqrt(11)
d ≈ 0.1181 nm

Now that we have the d-spacing, we can use Bragg's Law to find θ:

1 * (0.1542 nm) = 2 * (0.1181 nm) * sinθ

Rearrange the equation to solve for sinθ:

sinθ = (0.1542 nm) / (2 * 0.1181 nm)
sinθ ≈ 0.6531

Now, to find the angle θ, we need to take the inverse sine (arcsin) of the sinθ value:

θ = arcsin(0.6531)
θ ≈ 40.687°

So, the expected diffraction angle for the first order reflection from the (113) set of planes in a face centered cubic Pt lattice using monochromatic radiation of wavelength 0.1542 nm is approximately 40.687°.
