The first step is to determine the molar mass of GaAs:

$M_{(GaAs)} = M_{(Ga)} + M_{(As)}$

$M_{(GaAs)} = 69.72 g/mol + 74.92 g/mol$

$M_{(GaAs)}= 144.64 g/mol$

Next, we can use the molar mass of GaAs to determine the number of moles required to make 1.0 kg of the compound:

$1000 g \div 144.64 g/mol = 6.91$ mol

Since the ratio of Ga to As in GaAs is 1:1, we need 6.91 mol of each element to make 1.0 kg of GaAs.

To determine the weight of Ga required, we can use its molar mass:

$6.91$ mol x $69.72 g/mol = 481.09 g$

Finally, we convert grams to kilograms:

$481.09 g \div 1000 = 0.48109$ kg

Therefore, the weight in kg of gallium (Ga) to be mixed with arsenic (As) for obtaining 1.0 kg of gallium arsenide (GaAs) is 0.48109 kg.

Answer: [0.48109 kg]
