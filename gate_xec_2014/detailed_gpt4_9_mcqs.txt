To determine which crystal class would exhibit both piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties, we need to understand the properties of each class and the criteria for displaying piezoelectric and ferroelectric behavior.

Piezoelectric materials: These materials generate an electrical charge when subjected to mechanical stress or strain. For a material to be piezoelectric, it must not have a center of symmetry (also called a center of inversion). In other words, it should belong to a non-centrosymmetric crystal class.

Ferroelectric materials: These materials possess a spontaneous electric polarization that can be reversed by an external electric field. Ferroelectric materials must also lack a center of symmetry and fall within a polar crystal class, meaning they have a unique polar axis.

Now, we can evaluate each crystal class:

(A) 222: This crystal class has a center of symmetry, so it cannot be either piezoelectric or ferroelectric.

(B) 4mm: This crystal class does not have a center of symmetry, which means it can be piezoelectric. However, it is non-polar, meaning it cannot be ferroelectric.

(C) -1: This crystal class has a center of symmetry, so it cannot be either piezoelectric or ferroelectric.

(D) 2/m: This crystal class does not have a center of symmetry, which means it can be piezoelectric. Additionally, it is a polar crystal class, making it able to be ferroelectric as well.

Thus, among these crystal classes, only class 2/m would be both piezoelectric and ferroelectric.

The correct answer is: [D]
