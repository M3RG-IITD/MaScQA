First, we need to understand what the Bragg equation is and how it relates to Miller indices. The Bragg equation is:

nλ = 2d sinθ

where n is an integer, λ is the wavelength of the X-ray, d is the distance between atomic planes in the crystal, and θ is the angle of incidence of the X-ray on the crystal. 

The Miller indices (hkl) of a set of atomic planes in a crystal are related to the distance between those planes (d) by the formula:

1/d^2 = (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)/a^2

where a is the lattice constant. 

Now, let's consider the given options:

(A) (111), (200), (220)
(B) (100), (110), (111)
(C) (100), (110), (200)
(D) (110), (200), (220)

Since we are dealing with a polycrystalline sample, we can assume that the crystal is randomly oriented in all directions. This means that we will observe Bragg peaks corresponding to all possible sets of lattice planes that satisfy the Bragg equation. 

Let's analyze each option and see if it fits the observed peaks:

(A) (111), (200), (220)
For (111), we have d = a/√3, which is consistent with the first peak.
For (200), we have d = a/2, which is consistent with the second peak.
For (220), we have d = a/√8, which is consistent with the third peak.
This option seems to be a good fit.

(B) (100), (110), (111)
For (100), we have d = a, which does not fit any of the observed peaks.
For (110), we have d = a/√2, which is consistent with the first peak.
For (111), we have d = a/√3, which is consistent with the third peak.
This option does not fit the observed peaks.

(C) (100), (110), (200)
For (100), we have d = a, which does not fit any of the observed peaks.
For (110), we have d = a/√2, which is consistent with the first peak.
For (200), we have d = a/2, which is consistent with the second peak.
This option does not fit the observed peaks.

(D) (110), (200), (220)
For (110), we have d = a/√2, which is consistent with the first peak.
For (200), we have d = a/2, which is consistent with the second peak.
For (220), we have d = a/√8, which is consistent with the third peak.
This option seems to be a good fit.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) (111), (200), (220).
