First, we need to determine the expression for the equilibrium concentration of vacancies, which is given by the equation:

n(vacancies) / n(total) = exp[-Q(vacancies) / kT]

where n(vacancies) is the number of vacancies, n(total) is the total number of sites in the lattice, Q(vacancies) is the energy of formation of vacancies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

We are given that Q(vacancies) = 0.9 eV and k = 8.62 * 10^(-5) eV/K. We need to convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin by adding 273 to get:

T = 27Â°C + 273 = 300 K

Substituting these values into the expression, we get:

n(vacancies) / n(total) = exp[-0.9 eV / (8.62 * 10^(-5) eV/K * 300 K)]

n(vacancies) / n(total) = exp[-32.95]

Finally, we can solve for the fraction of vacancies by dividing both sides by n(total) and converting the result to scientific notation:

n(vacancies) / n(total) = 2.87 * 10^(-15)

Therefore, x = 2.87. The answer is [2.87 * 10^(-16)].
