To solve this problem, we first need to understand some key concepts:

Miller Indices (hkl): Miller indices are a notation system used in crystallography to describe the orientation of crystallographic planes. They are represented as (hkl) where h, k, and l are integers that are inversely proportional to the intercepts of the planes with the lattice vectors.

Bragg's Law: Bragg's law describes the relationship between the angle of incident X-rays, the crystal lattice spacing (d), and the order of reflection (n) in X-ray diffraction. It is given by

nλ = 2d sinθ

where λ is the wavelength of X-rays, and θ is the angle between the incident X-ray and the crystal plane.

For Bragg reflections, the interplanar spacing d depends on the crystal structure and Miller indices. In the case of Iron (Fe), the crystal structure is Body-Centered Cubic (BCC).

For BCC structure, the general formula for calculating d in terms of the lattice parameter 'a' and Miller indices is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²) / a²

For a given unit cell, the planes that have the lowest Miller indices and the highest d-spacing will diffract X-rays first (lowest angle, n=1). So, we need to find the first three Bragg peaks for Fe, which means identifying the three lowest Miller indices sets.

By systematically listing all possible combinations of h, k, and l, and identifying those that satisfy the BCC selection rule (h + k + l = even), we get the following allowable Miller indices as:

(100), (110), and (200)

Now, we can rank these by their d-spacing. Based on the formula for d in BCC structure:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²) / a² 

The magnitudes of the squared Miller indices (h² + k² + l²) for these combinations are:

(100) → 1² + 0² + 0² = 1
(110) → 1² + 1² + 0² = 2
(200) → 2² + 0² + 0² = 4

Now, we can order these combinations by their magnitudes:

(100) < (110) < (200)

Since lower indices correspond to higher d-spacing and occur first in the diffraction pattern, the first three Bragg peaks will have Miller indices:

(100), (110), and (200)

Thus, the correct answer is:

(C) (100), (110), (200)
