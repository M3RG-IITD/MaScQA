To solve this problem, we'll use Boltzmann's equation that relates the fraction of vacancies in a material with the energy of formation of vacancies and temperature.

To find the fraction of vacancies, we can use the following formula:

Fraction of vacancies = $n_v/n_a = e^{-(E_v / kT)}$

Where:
- $n_v$ = number of vacant sites
- $n_a$ = number of atomic sites
- $E_v$ = energy of formation of vacancies (0.9 eV)
- $k$ = Boltzmann's constant (8.62 * $10^{-5}$ eV/K)
- $T$ = temperature in Kelvin (27 °C = 300 K, since the temperature must be converted to Kelvin: 273 + 27 = 300)

Now we can plug in the values into the formula:

Fraction of vacancies = $e^{-(0.9 / (8.62 * 10^{-5} * 300))}$

Fraction of vacancies = $e^{-(0.9 / (2.586 * 10^{-2}))}$

First, calculate the exponent:

Exponent = $-0.9 / (2.586 * 10^{-2}) = -34.812$

Now, plug the exponent back into the equation:

Fraction of vacancies = $e^{-34.812}$

To express this fraction in the desired format, we must multiply it by $10^{16}$:

x * $10^{-16} = e^{-34.812}$

Solve for x by multiplying both sides by $10^{16}$:

x = $e^{-34.812} * 10^{16}$

Now we can use a calculator or online tool to find x:

x ≈ 8.47 

Therefore, the fraction of vacancies in pure copper at 27 °C is approximately 8.47 * $10^{-16}$.
