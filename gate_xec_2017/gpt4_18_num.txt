To solve this problem, we will use the Griffith's equation for the stress required to propagate a crack in a brittle material:

σ = (2 * E * γ) / (π * a)

Where:
σ is the fracture stress,
E is the Young's modulus,
γ is the surface energy, and
a is the half-length of the crack (critical flaw size).

We are not given the value of E and γ, but since they are the same for the same material, we can set up a ratio of the given fracture stresses and solve for the unknown fracture stress for a critical flaw size of 90 μm. 

Let σ1 and a1 be the fracture stress and the critical flaw size for the first example, and σ2 and a2 for the second example.

So, σ1 = 300 MPa and a1 = 30 μm.
We need to find σ2 for a2 = 90 μm.

Using the Griffith's equation, we can set up a ratio:

σ1/σ2 = (a2/a1)

Plug in the values:

300/σ2 = (90/30)

Now, solve for σ2:

σ2 = 300 * (30/90)
σ2 = 300 * (1/3)
σ2 = 100 MPa

So the fracture stress for a critical flaw size of 90 μm for the same material will be 100 MPa.
