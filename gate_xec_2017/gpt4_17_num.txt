We can use the formula for calculating the fraction of vacancies in a material at a specific temperature, which is given by:

Fraction of vacancies = N_v / N = exp(-E_f / (k * T))

where N_v is the number of vacancies, N is the total number of atoms, E_f is the energy of formation of vacancies (given as 0.9 eV), k is Boltzmann constant (given as 8.62 x 10^(-5) eV/K), and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

First, we need to convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin:
T = 27 °C + 273.15 = 300.15 K

Now substitute the given values into the formula:
Fraction of vacancies = exp(-0.9 / (8.62 * 10^(-5) * 300.15))

Solve the expression: 
Fraction of vacancies = exp(-0.9 / (0.0000862 * 300.15))
Fraction of vacancies = exp(-0.9 / 0.02585103)
Fraction of vacancies = exp(-34.815517463)

Now, to find the value of x, we multiply the fraction of vacancies by 10^16:
x = Fraction of vacancies * 10^16
x = exp(-34.815517463) * 10^16

Calculating this expression, we get:
x ≈ 1.9719

So the fraction of vacancies in pure copper at 27 °C is approximately 1.9719 * 10^(-16). Thus, x = 1.9719. The correct answer is [1.9719].
