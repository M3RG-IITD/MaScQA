In a Face Centered Cubic (FCC) metal, the atoms are arranged such that they form a lattice structure with a close packing of planes. In this arrangement, there are atoms at each corner of the cube and an additional atom at the center of each face. The FCC lattice is also known as the Cubic Close Packed (CCP) structure. Let's analyze the number of close packed planes in the FCC lattice.

Step 1: Identify the close-packed planes
The close-packed planes in an FCC lattice are the {111} family of planes, which consists of the (111), (1̅11), (11̅1), (1̅1̅1), (111̅), and (1̅11̅) planes. These planes are equivalent in the sense that they have the same environment of atoms and have the highest density of atoms. In the FCC structure, the {111} planes are stacked in the ABCABC... pattern.

Step 2: Count the number of unique close-packed planes
Let's identify the number of unique {111} planes in the FCC lattice.

1. (111) plane: This plane has atoms at (0,0,0), (0.5, 0.5, 0), (0.5, 0, 0.5), and (0, 0.5, 0.5), which are the positions of the corner and the center of the bottom face in the unit cell.

2. (1̅11) plane: This plane has atoms at (1,0,0), (0.5, 0.5, 0), (0.5, 0, 0.5), and (1, 0.5, 0.5), which corresponds to the corner and the center of the right face in the unit cell.

3. (11̅1) plane: This plane has atoms at (0,1,0), (0.5, 0.5, 0), (0.5, 1, 0.5), and (0, 0.5, 0.5), which corresponds to the corner and the center of the top face in the unit cell.

4. (1̅1̅1) plane: This plane has atoms at (1,1,0), (0.5, 0.5, 0), (0.5, 1, 0.5), and (1, 0.5, 0.5), which corresponds to the corner and the center of the left face in the unit cell.

5. (111̅) plane: This plane has atoms at (0,0,1), (0.5, 0.5, 1), (0.5, 0, 0.5), and (0, 0.5, 0.5), which corresponds to the corner and the center of the front face in the unit cell.

6. (1̅11̅) plane: This plane has atoms at (1,0,1), (0.5, 0.5, 1), (0.5, 0, 0.5), and (1, 0.5, 0.5), which corresponds to the corner and the center of the back face in the unit cell.

Thus, there are 6 unique close-packed planes in an FCC metal lattice.

Answer: The correct answer is (C) 6.
