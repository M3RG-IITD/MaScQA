In an ionic solid, the coordination number refers to the number of ions of opposite charge that immediately surround an ion. The coordination number depends on the relative sizes of the cations and anions. The cation-to-anion radius ratio (r+/r-) is used for predicting the coordination number. 

Here, we are given that the ionic radii of cation (r+) and anion (r-) are 0.8 Å and 1.6 Å.

Let's calculate the cation-to-anion radius ratio:

r+/r- = (0.8 Å)/(1.6 Å) = 0.5

Now, let's define the ranges for the ratio that correspond to each maximum coordination number:

1. Linear Coordination (Coordination Number = 2): 0 < r+/r- ≤ 0.155
2. Triangular Coordination (Coordination Number = 3): 0.155 < r+/r- ≤ 0.225
3. Tetrahedral Coordination (Coordination Number = 4): 0.225 < r+/r- ≤ 0.414
4. Octahedral Coordination (Coordination Number = 6): 0.414 < r+/r- ≤ 0.732
5. Cubic Coordination (Coordination Number = 8): 0.732 < r+/r- ≤ 1

Since the cation-to-anion radius ratio we calculated (0.5) falls into the range for octahedral coordination (0.414 - 0.732), the maximum coordination number of the cation in the structure will be 6.

So, the correct answer is (C) 6.
