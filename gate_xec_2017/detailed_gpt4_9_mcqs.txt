Electrical conductivity of silicon can be increased by changing its internal structure or altering the number of free charge carriers (electrons and holes) in the material. Let's analyze each option:

(i) Heating: When silicon is heated, the thermal energy causes electrons to gain enough energy to jump from the valence band to the conduction band. The increased number of electrons in the conduction band can now participate in electrical conduction. Therefore, heating can increase the electrical conductivity of silicon.

(ii) Doping with arsenic: Arsenic is a group 15 element (n-type dopant), and it has 5 valence electrons. When it is added to silicon (which is a group 14 element with 4 valence electrons), it creates an extra electron in the lattice structure. These extra electrons are free to move in the silicon crystal, contributing to electrical conduction. So, doping with arsenic increases the conductivity of silicon.

(iii) Doping with aluminium: Aluminium is a group 13 element (p-type dopant), and it has 3 valence electrons. When it is added to silicon, it creates a missing electron, also known as a hole, in the crystal lattice. In the presence of an electric field, these holes can move, and electrons from neighboring silicon atoms can fill these holes. This movement of holes and electrons leads to an increase in electrical conductivity. Therefore, doping with aluminium can increase the conductivity of silicon.

(iv) Exposure to light: When silicon is exposed to light, the photons in the light can transfer energy to the electrons in the silicon, promoting them from the valence band to the conduction band. The increased number of electrons in the conduction band can now participate in electrical conduction. So, exposure to light can increase the electrical conductivity of silicon.

Based on the analysis, all options (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) can increase the electrical conductivity of silicon.

The correct answer is: (D) All (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv).
