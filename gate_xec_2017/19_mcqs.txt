An inorganic material that is transparent under solar light appears coloured when doped with transition metal ions. The possible reason(s) for the colour is/are: (i) The electronic energy levels of the host materials changes significantly by doping (ii) The doped element selectively absorbs certain wavelength of light other than the perceived colour (iii) The doped element emits radiation of specific wavelength. Which of the previous statement(s) is/are true?
(A) Only (i) (B) Both (i) and (ii) (C) Both (i) and (iii) (D) Both (ii) and (iii)
