To calculate the density of totally crystalline PE, we need to find the mass within the unit cell and divide it by the unit cell volume.

Step 1: Find the molecular weight of one ethylene repeat unit:

Molecular weight of C2H4 (1 Ethylene repeat unit) = 2 * 12.01 (Carbon) + 4 * 1.008 (Hydrogen)
= 24.02 + 4.032
= 28.052 g/mol

Step 2: Find the molecular weight of two ethylene repeat units in each unit cell:

Weight in one unit cell = 28.052 * 2 g/mol
= 56.104 g/mol

Step 3: Calculate the mass inside the unit cell by dividing the weight by Avogadro's number: 

Mass inside one unit cell = 56.104 g/mol / (6.023 * 10^23 molecules/mol)
= 9.315 * 10^(-23) g

Step 4: Convert the unit cell volume from $nm^3$ to $cm^3$:

Unit cell volume = 0.0933 * (10^(-7) cm)^3
= 9.33 * 10^(-23) cm^3

Step 5: Calculate the density of totally crystalline PE:

Density = Mass / Volume
= (9.315 * 10^(-23) g) / (9.33 * 10^(-23) cm^3)
= 0.99823 g/cm^3

The density of totally crystalline PE can be approximated as 0.998 g/cmÂ³.

The answer is [0.998].
