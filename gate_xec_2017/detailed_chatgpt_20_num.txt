The average number of free electrons per atom can be calculated using the formula:

n = (ρ*m)/(N*e^2*μ)

where:
ρ = electrical resistivity of copper 
m = atomic mass of copper
N = Avogadro's number (6.02 * $10^23$ atoms/mol)
e = charge of an electron
μ = electron mobility

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

m = 63.55 g/mol      (atomic mass of copper)
N = 6.02 * $10^23$ atoms/mol   (Avogadro's number)
e = 1.6* $10^(-19)$ C   (charge of an electron)
μ = 3.2 * $10^(-3)m^(2)V^(-1)s^(-1)$   (electron mobility)
ρ = 1.7* $10^(-8)$ Ωm   (electrical resistivity of copper)

Plugging these values into the above formula we get:

n = (ρ*m)/(N*e^2*μ)
n = (1.7* $10^(-8)$ * 63.55)/(6.02 * $10^23$ * (1.6* $10^(-19))^2*3.2 * $10^(-3)$)
n = 8.47

Rounding up to the nearest whole number, the average number of free electrons per atom in copper is 8. Therefore, the correct answer is:
