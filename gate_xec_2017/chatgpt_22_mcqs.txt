The correct answer is:

(D) (i) and (iv)

Explanation: 

(i) Magnetic susceptibility is positive for a diamagnetic material.

(iv) Magnetic susceptibility is positive for a paramagnetic material.

Diamagnetic materials have all paired electrons, so when an external magnetic field is applied, the orbital motion of the electrons changes and a small magnetic field is induced opposite to the applied field. This results in a positive magnetic susceptibility.

Paramagnetic materials have unpaired electrons, so they align their magnetic moments with the applied field, resulting in a positive magnetic susceptibility. 

Antiferromagnetic materials have paired spins, and although their magnetic moments are not zero, they do not respond to an external magnetic field. Therefore, their magnetic susceptibility is zero.
