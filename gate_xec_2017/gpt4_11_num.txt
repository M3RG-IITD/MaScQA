To find the modulus of elasticity for the composite in the direction of fibre alignment, we will use the Rule of Mixtures for continuous aligned fibre composites. The equation is as follows:

E_comp = E_fibre * V_fibre + E_resin * V_resin

where 
E_comp is the modulus of elasticity of the composite
E_fibre is the modulus of elasticity of the CF (170 GPa)
V_fibre is the volume fraction of the CF (30% = 0.3)
E_resin is the modulus of elasticity of the resin (3.0 GPa)
V_resin is the volume fraction of the resin (70% = 0.7)

Now, we can plug in the values and calculate E_comp:

E_comp = (170 GPa * 0.3) + (3.0 GPa * 0.7)
E_comp = 51 GPa + 2.1 GPa
E_comp = 53.1 GPa

So, the modulus of elasticity for this composite in the direction of fibre alignment is 53.1 GPa.
