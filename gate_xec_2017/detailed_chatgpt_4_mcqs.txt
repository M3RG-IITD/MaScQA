(i) Polymers that are less coiled are more crystalline than those that are more coiled: True. The degree of crystallinity in a polymer is dependent on how much the polymer chains can approach each other and become ordered. The more coiled the polymer chains are, the more difficult it becomes for them to become ordered. Hence, less coiled polymers are more crystalline.

(ii) Branched polymers are more crystalline than the linear ones: False. Branched polymers are less crystalline than linear polymers. When the polymer chains branch off, it becomes more challenging for the chains to align and pack together to form crystal structures. Linear polymers have more aligned packing chains, hence, are more crystalline.

(iii) Polymers with inter-chain interactions have higher glass transition temperature than those without inter-chain interactions: True. Glass transition temperature (Tg) refers to the temperature range where a polymer transition from a hard and brittle state to a more ductile or rubbery state. Polymers with inter-chain interactions entangle and become more rigid, requiring more energy to achieve a transition to a rubbery state.

(iv) Polymers with inter-chain interactions are more crystalline than those without inter-chain interactions: True. Intermolecular forces between the polymer chains influence their degree of crystallinity. Polymers with inter-chain interactions have more aligned packing chains, hence, more crystalline.


Therefore, the correct answer is (B) (i) and (iii).
