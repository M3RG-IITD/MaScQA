We are given the following information:

1. Charge of an electron (e): 1.6 * 10^(-19) C
2. Copper is an FCC metal with a lattice parameter (a): 3.62 Å
3. Electron mobility (µ): 3.2 * 10^(-3) m²/Vs
4. Electrical resistivity of copper (ρ): 1.7 * 10^(-8) Ωm

We are asked to find the average number of free electrons per atom in copper.

First, we need to find the number of atoms per unit cell in FCC.

For FCC, there are 4 atoms per unit cell. This is because each corner atom is shared by 8 adjacent cells (1/8 per cell contribution), and each face-centered atom is shared by 2 cells (1/2 per cell contribution).

So, there are 8*(1/8) corner atoms + 6*(1/2) face-centered atoms = 1 + 3 = 4 atoms per unit cell.

Now, we convert the lattice parameter to meters:

a = 3.62 Å * 10^(-10) m/Å = 3.62 * 10^(-10) m

Now we find the volume of the unit cell:

V = a³ = (3.62 * 10^(-10) m)³ ≈ 4.74 * 10^(-29) m³

Now we can calculate the electronic conductivity (σ) of copper using the relation:

σ = µ * e * n (where n is the number of free electrons per unit volume)

We can also relate the conductivity (σ) with the resistivity (ρ) as:

ρ = 1/σ

Let's find the conductivity first:

σ = 1/ρ = 1/(1.7 * 10^(-8) Ωm) ≈ 5.88 * 10^7 S/m

Now we substitute the conductivity and other values into the first equation:

σ = µ * e * n
5.88 * 10^7 S/m = (3.2 * 10^(-3) m²/Vs) * (1.6 * 10^(-19) C) * n

Now we solve for n:

n ≈ 5.88 * 10^7 S/m / [(3.2 * 10^(-3) m²/Vs) * (1.6 * 10^(-19) C)]
n ≈ 1.16 * 10^29 m^(-3)

We have found the number of free electrons per unit volume. Now we need to find the number of free electrons per atom.

As we found earlier, there are 4 atoms per unit cell. Let's find the number of unit cells per unit volume:

Number of unit cells per unit volume = 1/V = 1/(4.74 * 10^(-29) m³) ≈ 2.11 * 10^28 m^(-3)

Now, we can find the number of atoms per unit volume:

Number of atoms per unit volume = 4 atoms/unit cell * 2.11 * 10^28 unit cells/m³ ≈ 8.44 * 10^28 atoms/m³

Finally, we find the average number of free electrons per atom:

Number of free electrons per atom = n / (Number of atoms per unit volume)

Number of free electrons per atom ≈ (1.16 * 10^29 m^(-3)) / (8.44 * 10^28 atoms/m³) ≈ 1.37

The average number of free electrons per atom in copper is approximately 1.37.
