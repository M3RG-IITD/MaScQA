We are given:

- Charge of an electron (e) = 1.6 * 10^(-19) C
- Lattice parameter (a) = 3.62 Å = 3.62 * 10^(-10) m
- Electron mobility (μ) = 3.2 * 10^(-3) m^2/Vs
- Electrical resistivity (ρ) = 1.7 * 10^(-8) Ωm

We know that the conductivity (σ) is the inverse of the resistivity (ρ):

σ = 1/ρ

From Drude's model, we have the formula for conductivity:

σ = n * e * μ

Where n is the number of free electrons per unit volume, and μ is the electron mobility.

We can rewrite the formula for n:

n = σ / (e * μ)

First, we need to find the conductivity (σ):

σ = 1 / (1.7 * 10^(-8) Ωm) = 5.88 * 10^7 S/m

Now we can find the number of free electrons per unit volume (n):

n = (5.88 * 10^7 S/m) / ((1.6 * 10^(-19) C) * (3.2 * 10^(-3) m^2/Vs))
n ≈ 1.15 * 10^29 m^(-3)

To find the average number of free electrons per atom, we need to find the number of atoms per unit volume. In the FCC structure, there are 4 atoms per unit cell. The volume of a unit cell is a^3, so the number of atoms per unit volume is:

Number of atoms per unit volume = 4 / (3.62 * 10^(-10) m)^3 = 8.48 * 10^28 m^(-3)

The average number of free electrons per atom is:

Free electrons per atom = (1.15 * 10^29 m^(-3)) / (8.48 * 10^28 m^(-3)) ≈ 1.36

Therefore, the average number of free electrons per atom in copper is approximately 1.36. So, the answer is [1.36].
