In a semi-crystalline polymer with spherulitic morphology under tension, there are generally two main regions: the amorphous regions and the crystalline regions. The amorphous regions consist of disordered polymer chains, while the crystalline regions are composed of ordered, tightly packed polymer chains.

Let's analyze each option.

(A) Amorphous regions remain intact and only crystallites experience bending and stretching of chains: This statement is incorrect. It is unlikely that the amorphous regions would remain intact under stress, as these disordered polymer chains have more freedom to move and deform compared to the crystalline regions.

(B) Only amorphous regions elongate in the stress direction and crystallites remain intact: This statement is also incorrect. While it is true that the amorphous regions are more prone to elongation due to their disordered nature, the crystalline regions can still experience some degree of deformation at higher stress levels.

(C) Amorphous regions elongate in the stress direction and crystallites experience bending and stretching of chains: This statement is correct. Under tension, both the amorphous and crystalline regions can deform (albeit to different extents) due to the applied stress. The amorphous regions will primarily elongate, while the crystalline regions can experience both bending and stretching of chains.

(D) None of the above: Since option (C) is correct, this statement is incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer to this question is:
[C]
