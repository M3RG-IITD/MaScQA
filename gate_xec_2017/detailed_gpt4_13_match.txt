Let's match the processes in Column I with the products in Column II one by one.

(P) Slip casting: Slip casting is a technique used in the production of ceramic parts. In this process, a liquid slip (a suspension of ceramic particles in water) is poured into a porous mold which absorbs the water in the slip, leaving a solid, shaped mass of ceramic particles called a greenware. This corresponds to product (3) in Column II.

(Q) Zone refining: Zone refining is a process used for purifying a crystalline material, often used to produce high-purity single crystals. A small section (zone) of the crystal is melted, and as this zone moves through the material, impurities are separated, and a single crystal is formed. This process corresponds to product (4) in Column II.

(R) Sputtering: Sputtering is a technique used mainly for depositing thin films onto a substrate. In this process, ions are bombarded on the target material, and the sputtered material is transported to and deposited on the substrate. This process corresponds to product (2) in Column II.

(S) Atomization: Atomization is a process used to produce metal powders. In this process, liquid metal is forced through an orifice at high pressure and is broken up into tiny droplets, which solidify into powder particles. This process corresponds to product (1) in Column II.

Based on these matches, the correct answer is:
[(A) P-3; Q-4; R-2; S-1]
