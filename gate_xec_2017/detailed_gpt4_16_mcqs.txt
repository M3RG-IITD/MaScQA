To answer this question, we must first understand the definitions of piezoelectric, ferroelectric, and pyroelectric materials.

Piezoelectric materials: These materials exhibit an electrical response when subjected to mechanical stress, and vice versa. The piezoelectric effect is observed in certain crystals, ceramics, and polymers.

Ferroelectric materials: These materials have a spontaneous electric polarization that can be reversed by applying an external electric field. This property is due to the presence of domains with different orientations of polarization in the materials.

Pyroelectric materials: These materials generate an electric charge when heated or cooled, i.e., they exhibit a temperature-dependent polarization. Conversely, they can display a temperature change when an electric field is applied.

Now, let's analyze each statement.

(i) All piezoelectric materials are necessarily ferroelectric:
This statement is not true. While all ferroelectric materials are piezoelectric, not all piezoelectric materials are ferroelectric. Some piezoelectric materials may not have the property of ferroelectricity, i.e., the spontaneous polarization that can be reversed using an electric field.

(ii) All ferroelectric materials are necessarily piezoelectric:
This statement is true. In ferroelectric materials, the electric polarization can be reversed by an electric field, which causes a change in the arrangement of positively and negatively charged ions. This shift in the electric dipoles also results in an electric response when subjected to mechanical stress, which makes ferroelectric materials piezoelectric.

(iii) All pyroelectric materials are necessarily piezoelectric:
This statement is not true. Pyroelectric materials exhibit temperature-dependent polarization, but they might not exhibit the direct piezoelectric effect (an electrical response to mechanical stress or vice versa). While some pyroelectric materials are also piezoelectric, it is not necessarily true for all pyroelectric materials.

(iv) All pyroelectric materials are necessarily ferroelectric:
This statement is true. The pyroelectric effect occurs due to the presence of domains with different orientations of polarization, which is a characteristic property of ferroelectric materials. When heated or cooled, the domains in pyroelectric materials shift, causing a change in their electric field. Thus, all pyroelectric materials are ferroelectric.

In conclusion, the correct answer is (D) (ii) and (iv).
