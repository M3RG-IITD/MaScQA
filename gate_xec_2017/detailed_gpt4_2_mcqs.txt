To determine the best processing technique for manufacturing decorative PVC floor tiles, let's analyze each technique and evaluate their suitability for producing PVC tiles:

A) Blow molding:
Blow molding is a manufacturing process used for producing hollow plastic parts such as bottles, containers, and other similar products. The process involves inflating a heated plastic tube called a parison, which is inflated like a balloon to form the final part. This method is not suitable for making PVC floor tiles, as floor tiles need to be flat and solid, not hollow.

B) Filament winding:
Filament winding is a process used to produce composite parts where the fibers are wound around a mandrel while applying a resin matrix. This technique is mainly used for creating cylindrical or rounded products, such as pressure vessels, pipes, and similar items. Filament winding is not suitable for manufacturing decorative PVC floor tiles as they are typically flat and lack the complex curves that filament winding excels at creating.

C) Rotational molding:
Rotational molding, also known as rotomolding, is a manufacturing process in which a heated hollow plastic material is placed inside a mold, which is then rotated on all axes. This rotation evenly distributes the plastic to form the desired shape. Rotational molding is mainly used for producing large and hollow products, such as tanks, containers, and playground equipment. While rotational molding can produce a variety of shapes, it is not ideal for manufacturing PVC floor tiles that are flat, solid, and intricate in design.

D) Calendering:
Calendering is a process used in the production of plastic sheets, films, and foils, where the plastic material is heated, squeezed between large rollers, and cooled to form a continuous sheet. This process can be used to adjust the thickness, texture, and appearance of the final product, making it a suitable choice for manufacturing decorative PVC floor tiles. Calendering can create flat, thin sheets of PVC that can be further processed or treated to obtain the desired design, texture, and properties necessary for PVC floor tiles.

Considering the specific requirements of decorative PVC floor tiles, which include a flat, solid design and the typical material properties of PVC, the most suitable option among the given techniques is:
