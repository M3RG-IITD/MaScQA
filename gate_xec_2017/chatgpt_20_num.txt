First, we need to find the drift velocity of electrons in copper. We can use the formula:

𝑉𝑑 = 𝐸/𝑏

Where Vd is drift velocity, E is electric field strength and b is electron mobility. Let's assume a voltage of 1V is applied across a copper wire of length 1m (this is just for convenience, we can assume any value and still get the correct answer). Then,

𝑉𝑑 = 𝐸/𝑏
𝑉𝑑 = 1V/3.2 * $10^(-3)m^(2)V^(-1)s^(-1)$
𝑉𝑑 = 3.125 * $10^(-4)$ ms^(-1)

Next, we can use the formula for resistivity:

𝜌 = 𝑅∗𝐴/𝑙

Where 𝜌 is resistivity, R is resistance, A is cross-sectional area and l is length. Rearranging the formula gives:

𝑅 = 𝜌∗𝑙/𝐴

We know that the resistivity of copper is 1.7* $10^(-8)$ Ωm, and the lattice parameter is 3.62 Å or 3.62* $10^(-10)$ m. The unit cell of FCC copper has 4 atoms, so the volume of each atom is (3.62* $10^(-10)$ m / 2)^3 = 4.09 * $10^(-29)$ m^3. Therefore, the number density of atoms is:

𝑛 = (Avogadro's number) / (volume of one atom)

𝑛 = 6.022 * $10^(23)$ / 4.09 * $10^(-29)$
𝑛 = 1.47 * $10^(28)$ m^(-3)

Now, we can find the average length of a copper wire with one atom thick. We know that the cross-sectional area of the wire is just the area of one atom, which is:

𝐴 = (𝑑/2)^2𝜋
𝐴 = (3.62* $10^(-10)$ m / 2)^2𝜋
𝐴 = 4.10 * $10^(-20)$ m^2

The length of the wire can be found by dividing the volume of one atom by the cross-sectional area:

𝑙 = 𝑣/𝐴
𝑙 = (4.09 * $10^(-29)$ m^3) / (4.10 * $10^(-20)$ m^2)
𝑙 = 9.98 * $10^(-10)$ m

Finally, we can use the formula for the number of free electrons per atom:

𝑛𝑒 = 𝑁𝑎 ∗ 𝜌𝑚/𝑀𝑎

Where Ne is the number of free electrons per atom, Na is Avogadro's number, 𝜌m is the mass density of copper and Ma is the atomic mass of copper.

The mass density of copper is:

𝜌m = 𝑁𝑎 ∗ 𝑀𝑎/𝑉𝑎

Where Va is the volume of one atom. We know that Va = 4/3 * (3.62* $10^(-10)$ m / 2)^3 = 6.91 * $10^(-29)$ m^3. Therefore,

𝑉𝑎 = 6.91 * $10^(-29)$ m^3
𝜌m = (6.022 * $10^(23)$) * (63.55 * (1.67* $10^(-27)$ kg)) / 6.91 * $10^(-29)$ m^3
𝜌m = 8.96 * $10^3$ kg/m^3

The atomic mass of copper is 63.55 g/mol or 63.55 * (1.67* $10^(-27)$ kg/1 g) = 1.06 * $10^(-25)$ kg.

Now, we can find the number of free electrons per atom:

𝑛𝑒 = 𝑁𝑎 ∗ 𝜌𝑚/𝑀𝑎
𝑛𝑒 = (6.022 * $10^(23)$) * (8.96 * $10^3$ kg/m^3) / (1.06 * $10^(-25)$ kg)
𝑛𝑒 = 8.49

Therefore, the average number of free electrons per atom in copper is 8.49.
