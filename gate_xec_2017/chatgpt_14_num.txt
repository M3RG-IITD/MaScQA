The diffusivity (D) can be calculated using the Arrhenius equation, which is given as:

$D = D_째*exp(-Q/RT)$

where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, Q is the activation energy, and $D_째$ is the pre-exponential factor. 

Given: 
$D_째$ = 2* $10^(-5)m^2/s$;
Q = 142 kJ/mol;
R = 8.314 J/mol.K;
T = 727째C = 1000 K (Temperature must be in kelvin)

Substituting the values, we get:

$D = (2*10^(-5))*exp(-142*10^3/(8.314*1000))$

Solving this equation, we get:

D = 4.74* $10^(-13) m^2/s$

Therefore, x = 4.74

Answer: [4.74]
