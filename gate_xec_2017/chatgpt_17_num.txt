We can use the formula: 

$$f_v = e^{-Q_v/kt}$$

where $f_v$ is the fraction of vacancies, $Q_v$ is the energy of formation of vacancies, $k$ is Boltzmann's constant, and $t$ is the temperature in Kelvin.

Substituting the given values:

$$f_v = e^{-0.9/ (8.62*10^{-5} * 300)}$$

Simplifying:

$$f_v = e^{-31.17}$$

Calculating:

$$f_v = 1.88 * 10^{-14}$$

Therefore, the value of x is 1.88. The answer in the desired format is:

- 1.88 * $10^(-16)$
