In an FCC (Face-Centered Cubic) lattice, each corner atom is shared between eight unit cells, while each face-centered atom is contained within two unit cells. 

In terms of close-packed planes, an FCC lattice has a total of 12 close-packed planes: 

- Each of the six faces has one close-packed plane (since it is the only plane that can be packed with spheres touching in a hexagonal pattern).
- Each of the eight "half-planes" (formed by cutting the cube diagonally across an octahedral plane) has one close-packed plane.
- Each of the twelve "quarter-planes" (formed by cutting off a corner of the cube) has one close-packed plane.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 12.
