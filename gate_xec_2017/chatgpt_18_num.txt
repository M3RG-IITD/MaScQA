We can use the Weibull theory to solve this problem. The Weibull modulus for ceramics is typically in the range of 5-20. For simplicity, let's assume it is 10 for this material.

The Weibull distribution is expressed as:

F(x) = 1 - exp[-(x/α)^m]

where F(x) is the probability of failure, x is the flaw size, α is the scale parameter, and m is the shape parameter.

For a given probability of failure (P), we can find the corresponding flaw size (x) by rearranging the equation as follows:

x = α * (-ln[1 - P])^(1/m)

Assuming a probability of failure of 0.1%, we can find the critical flaw size for the given material as follows:

x1 = α * (-ln[1 - 0.001])^(1/10) = 30 μm

To find the fracture stress for a critical flaw size of 90 μm, we can use the same equation with a new value of x:

90 μm = α * (-ln[1 - 0.001])^(1/10)

Solving for α:

α = 90 μm / (-ln[1 - 0.001])^(1/10) = 129.8 μm

Now we can use the fracture stress and the Weibull modulus to find the fracture stress for the new critical flaw size:

σ2 = σ1 * (x2/x1)^(-1/m)

where σ1 is the fracture stress for the initial flaw size, x1 is the initial flaw size, x2 is the new flaw size, and m is the Weibull modulus.

Plugging in the values:

σ2 = 300 MPa * (90/30)^(-1/10) = 104 MPa

Therefore, the fracture stress for a critical flaw size of 90 μm is 104 MPa.

Answer: [104 MPa]
