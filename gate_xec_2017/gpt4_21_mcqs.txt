The maximum coordination number of a cation in an ionic solid can be determined by the radius ratio rule. The radius ratio (r_cation / r_anion) is given by:

radius ratio = r_cation / r_anion = 0.8 Å / 1.6 Å = 0.5

Using the radius ratio rule, we can determine the maximum coordination number based on the following ranges:

1. If the radius ratio is between 0.225 and 0.414, the coordination number is 3.
2. If the radius ratio is between 0.414 and 0.732, the coordination number is 4.
3. If the radius ratio is between 0.732 and 1.000, the coordination number is 6.
4. If the radius ratio is equal to or greater than 1.000, the coordination number is 8.

Since the radius ratio for our given cation and anion is 0.5, it falls within the range for a coordination number of 4.

So the maximum coordination number of the cation in the structure is 4, which corresponds to option (B).

Correct answer: [4]
