The coordination number of an ion in an ionic solid depends on the size ratio of the cation and anion. To determine the maximum coordination number of the cation, we can use the following formula:

Coordination number = Radius of anion / Radius of cation

In this case, the cation has a radius of 0.8 Å and the anion has a radius of 1.6 Å. Therefore, the size ratio is:

Size ratio = Radius of anion / Radius of cation = 1.6 Å / 0.8 Å = 2

According to the empirical rule known as the "ionic size ratio rule", when the size ratio is 1:1, the coordination number is usually 4. When the size ratio is greater than 1:1, the coordination number increases, approaching 6 as the size ratio approaches 2. Therefore, the maximum coordination number of the cation in this structure is likely to be 6.

Answer: (C) 6
