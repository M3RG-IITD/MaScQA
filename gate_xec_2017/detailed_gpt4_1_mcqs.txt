Frenkel defect is a type of point defect specifically in ionic crystals, where an ion is missing from its normal position on the lattice and is found as an interstitial atom nearby. This creates a vacancy at the original position and an interstitial atom without any change in the overall stoichiometry of the crystal.

Let's analyze the given options:

(A) One Cl vacancy and one Na vacancy in NaCl:
This option describes the case where there is one vacancy in both Cl and Na components. So, both types of ions are missing from their lattice positions, but none of them is present nearby as an interstitial atom. Therefore, this is not a Frenkel defect.

(B) One Zn vacancy and one Zn interstitial in ZnO:
This option describes the case where there is one Zn vacancy and one Zn interstitial. Zn is missing from one of its lattice positions and is found nearby as an interstitial atom. There is no change in stoichiometry as there is still the same amount of Zn and O in the crystal. This is an example of a Frenkel defect.

(C) K at the Na site in NaCl:
This option describes the case where K atom (a foreign ion) is found at the Na site in NaCl. This is described as an impurity or substitutional defect, not a Frenkel defect. In a Frenkel defect, only one type of existing ion from the crystal is involved, and it leaves a vacancy in its original site and is found nearby as an interstitial ion.

(D) None of the above:
This option aims to say that no given option describes a Frenkel defect. However, option (B) is an example of a Frenkel defect.

Thus, the correct answer is [B], one Zn vacancy and one Zn interstitial in ZnO.
