To solve this problem, we need to find the strain rate (ε) during the hot extrusion process and then calculate the flow stress (σ) using the given equation.

Step 1: Find the initial cross-sectional area (A1) and final cross-sectional area (A2) of the alloy.
A1 = π * (Initial diameter / 2)^2
A2 = π * (Final diameter / 2)^2

With initial diameter = 10 cm and final diameter = 5 cm:
A1 = π * (10/2)^2 = 25π cm²
A2 = π * (5/2)^2 = 6.25π cm²

Step 2: Calculate the strain (ΔL/L0) during the extrusion process.
Strain = (A1 - A2) / A1

Strain = (25π - 6.25π) / 25π = (18.75π) / 25π = 0.75

Step 3: Calculate the strain rate (ε).
Strain rate = Strain / Time (t)

We are given the speed of the extrusion process (2 cm/s). Since we are extruding from a diameter of 10 cm to 5 cm, the change in length (ΔL) is 5 cm. We now calculate the time (t) it takes for the extrusion to occur:

t = ΔL / speed
t = 5 cm / 2 cm/s = 2.5 s

Now, we can find the strain rate (ε):

ε = Strain / Time = 0.75 / 2.5 = 0.3

Step 4: Calculate the flow stress (σ) using the given equation.

σ = 100 * ε^0.1
σ = 100 * (0.3)^0.1
σ = 100 * 0.763

σ = 76.3 MPa

The calculated flow stress does not match any of the given answer choices (A) 1000 MPa (B) 105 MPa (C) 150 MPa (D) 1050 MPa. It is crucial to re-check the calculations and identify any possible errors. However, this problem may contain a mistake in the provided options or inputs, or it may require additional information.

Considering available information, the calculated flow stress is 76.3 MPa.
