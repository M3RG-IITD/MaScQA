To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the strain rate (ε) during hot extrusion.

The initial area before extrusion (A1) is given by:
A1 = π(D1/2)^2 = π(10/2)^2 = 25π cm²

The final area after extrusion (A2) is given by:
A2 = π(D2/2)^2 = π(5/2)^2 = 6.25π cm²

The strain rate (ε) is given by the change in area divided by the initial area and the time taken:
ε = (A1 - A2) / (A1 * time) = (25π - 6.25π) / (25π * time)

The time taken to extrude can be calculated by dividing the reduction in diameter by the speed:
time = (D1 - D2) / speed = (10 - 5) / 2 = 5/2 seconds

Now, substitute the time taken into the formula for strain rate (ε):
ε = (25π - 6.25π) / (25π * 5/2) = (25 - 6.25) / (25 * 5/2) = (18.75) / (62.5) = 0.3

Next, use the formula for the flow stress (σ) given in the problem:
σ = 100 * (ε)^0.1 = 100 * (0.3)^0.1

Calculate the value of the flow stress (σ):
σ = 100 * (0.3)^0.1 ≈ 100 * 0.775 ≈ 77.5 MPa

Since this value is not found in the given options (A) 1000 MPa, (B) 105 MPa, (C) 150 MPa, and (D) 1050 MPa, I suspect there might be a typographical error in the given problem or the strain rate value might be incorrect.

If we use the provided answer choices, we can find the closest matching option to the calculated 77.5 MPa flow stress. In this case, the closest value is:

(B) 105 MPa.

So, the answer is [B].
