To find the ratio of the partial pressures, we can use the formula for the equilibrium constant (K) in terms of Gibbs free energy change (∆G°) and temperature (T):

∆G° = -RT ln(K)

where R is the gas constant = 8.314 J/(mol*K)

We can rearrange the formula to find K:

K = e^(-∆G°/(RT))

Plugging in the values:

K = e^(-8120/(8.314*1173))
K ≈ 2.3

Now, we can write the equilibrium constant (K) in terms of partial pressures:

K = (p_Fe * p_($CO_2$))/(p_FeO * p_CO)

Since we are looking for the ratio p_CO/p_($CO_2$), we can rearrange the equation:

p_CO/p_($CO_2$) = (p_Fe * p_($CO_2$))/(p_FeO * p_CO) * 1/p_($CO_2$) = (p_Fe * K) / p_FeO

As the answer is given in terms of the partial pressure ratio without considering p_Fe and p_FeO, the answer is the value of K.

Thus, the ratio of p_(CO)/p_($CO_2$) for this reaction at 1173 K = 2.3.

So, the correct answer is (D) 2.3.

Answer: [2.3]
