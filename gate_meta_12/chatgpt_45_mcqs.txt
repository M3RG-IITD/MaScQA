Given, σ = 100* $(ε)^(0.1)$ MPa

Given, speed of extrusion (ε) = 2 cm/s

We know that strain rate is given by ε = (2*v) / d

Where, v = speed of extrusion and d = initial diameter of the alloy

Putting the given values, we get ε = (2*2) / 10 = 0.4 s^-1

Now, σ = 100* $(ε)^(0.1)$ MPa

Putting the value of strain rate (ε), we get

σ = 100* $(0.4)^(0.1)$ MPa

σ = 105 MPa

Hence, the flow stress of the alloy is 105 MPa, which is option (B). 

Answer: 

(B) 105 MPa
