To answer this question, let's first understand what each of these properties means.

A) Yield strength: The stress at which a material begins to deform plastically, or change shape permanently. Heat treatment can alter the microstructure of a material, which can change its ability to withstand stress before deforming.

B) Ultimate tensile strength: The maximum stress a material can withstand before it breaks or fractures under tension. Heat treatment can alter a material's microstructure, affecting its overall strength, toughness, and ability to withstand load.

C) Ductility: The ability of a material to deform under tensile stress before breaking or fracturing. This property can be impacted by heat treatment since it affects the microstructure of the material, and thus, its ability to withstand stress and strain.

D) Elastic modulus: Also known as the Young's modulus, it is a measure of a material's stiffness or resistance to elastic deformation. Elastic modulus is governed by the inherent crystal structure and bonding of atoms in a material and is less influenced by the microstructure changes induced by heat treatment.

Now, let's analyze which property is not significantly changed by heat treatment:

Heat treatment generally alters the yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, and ductility of a material by changing its microstructure. These are all properties that can be influenced by heat treatment techniques such as quenching, annealing, or tempering.

In contrast, the elastic modulus of a material is mainly determined by the inherent crystal structure and bonding between atoms, which do not change significantly with heat treatment. Therefore, the elastic modulus is the property that cannot be significantly changed by heat treatment.

Answer: [D) Elastic modulus]
