We first need to understand the defects and processes from both groups.

Group I (Defects):
P. Cold shut: This defect occurs when two metal flows fail to fuse together properly due to impurities, low temperature, or other issues. This leaves a weak spot or small void in the metal.
Q. Earing: This defect refers to the formation of uneven protrusions or wavy edges during sheet metal forming, due to differences in the material's properties along various directions.
R. Alligatoring: This defect occurs when the surface of the metal cracks and resembles the skin of an alligator or crocodile. This is caused by excessive rolling or incorrect cooling procedures.
S. Shrinkage porosity: This defect occurs when the metal shrinks during solidification, leaving behind tiny voids or pores in the material.

Group II (Processes):
1. Rolling: This process involves passing the metal between two rollers, reducing its thickness and increasing its length.
2. Forging: This process involves shaping the metal using localized compressive forces, such as hammering or pressing the metal.
3. Deep drawing: This process involves forming sheet metal into a desired shape by forcing the sheet through a die or a series of dies.
4. Fusion welding: This process involves joining two metals by melting their surfaces together using heat.

Now let's match the defects with the processes:

P. Cold shut - Forging (P-2): This defect usually occurs during the forging process when the two metal flows don't completely fuse together.

Q. Earing - Deep drawing (Q-3): This defect occurs during the deep drawing process due to differences in the material's properties along various directions.

R. Alligatoring - Rolling (R-1): This defect occurs during the rolling process due to excessive rolling or incorrect cooling procedures.

S. Shrinkage porosity - Fusion welding (S-4): This defect occurs during the fusion welding process due to the metal's shrinkage, leaving behind voids or pores in the welded area.

So, the correct answer is (C) P-2, Q-3, R-1, S-4.
