The Burgers vector of partial dislocations for a given unit dislocation can be found by taking half of the magnitude of the Burgers vector of the unit dislocation and putting the appropriate signs. 

For the given unit dislocation with Burgers vector (a/2)[1 -1 0], one way to split it into partial dislocations is to cut along the (1-10) plane. This creates two partial dislocations with perpendicular line directions (1-10) and (11-2), respectively. 

The Burgers vector of the first partial dislocation is a vector that connects two points along the partial dislocation line and is perpendicular to the line direction. One possible choice is [2 -1 1]. Its magnitude is sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(6), so the magnitude of the Burgers vector of this partial dislocation is (a/2)sqrt(6)/6 = (a/6)sqrt(6). Note that the signs of the components of the Burgers vector are chosen so that the vector goes from the slip plane to the partial dislocation line.

The Burgers vector of the second partial dislocation is perpendicular to both the partial dislocation line and the first Burgers vector. One possible choice is [1 -2 -1]. Like before, its magnitude is sqrt(1^2 + (-2)^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(6), so the magnitude of the Burgers vector of this partial dislocation is (a/2)sqrt(6)/6 = (a/6)sqrt(6). Again, the signs of the components of the Burgers vector are chosen to go from the slip plane to the partial dislocation line. 

Therefore, the correct combination of the Burgers vectors of the partial dislocations is (A) (a/6)[2 -1 1] and (a/6)[1 -2 -1]. 

Answer: 
(A) (a/6)[2 -1 1] and (a/6)[1 -2 -1]
