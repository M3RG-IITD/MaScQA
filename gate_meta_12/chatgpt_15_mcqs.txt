We can use Bragg's law to relate the peak position to the lattice spacing:

2d sin θ = n λ

where d is the interplanar spacing, θ is the angle of the peak (78° in this case), n is an integer (we'll assume n=1 for the strongest peak), and λ is the wavelength of the incident X-rays (0.154 nm in this case).

For fcc crystals, the interplanar spacing of {hkl} planes is given by:

d = a / sqrt(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)

where a is the lattice parameter and h, k, and l are the Miller indices of the planes.

For {311} planes, we have h=3, k=1, and l=1, so:

d = a / sqrt(3^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) = a / sqrt(11)

Substituting this into Bragg's law and solving for a, we get:

a = 2d sqrt(11) / λ / sin θ

Plugging in the values given in the problem, we get:

a = 2 * (0.154 nm) * sqrt(11) / (sin 78°) = 0.385 nm

Therefore, the lattice parameter of the metal is approximately 0.385 nm, which corresponds to answer choice (B) 0.4 nm. 

Answer: 
- (B) 0.4 nm
