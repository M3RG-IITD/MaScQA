We can use Bragg's law to solve this problem:
$$2d\sin\theta = n\lambda$$
where $d$ is the spacing between the {311} planes, $\theta$ is the angle of incidence (which is equal to the angle of reflection in this case), $n$ is an integer, and $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the incident X-ray beam.

We can rearrange this equation to solve for $d$:
$$d = \frac{n\lambda}{2\sin\theta}$$

In this case, we have $\theta = 78^\circ$, $n = 1$, and $\lambda = 0.154$ nm. We need to determine $d$ in order to find the lattice parameter of the metal.

The spacing $d$ between {311} planes in an fcc crystal can be derived using the lattice parameter $a$:
$$d_{311} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{3}}$$

Substituting this expression into the equation above, we have:
$$\frac{a}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{n\lambda}{2\sin\theta}$$
$$a = \frac{2\sqrt{3}\sin\theta}{n\lambda}d_{311}$$
Substituting the given values, we get:
$$a = \frac{2\sqrt{3}\sin 78^\circ}{0.154~\mathrm{nm}}\left(\frac{d_{311}}{1}\right) \approx 0.408~\mathrm{nm}$$
Therefore, the lattice parameter of the metal is approximately 0.4 nm, which means the correct answer is (B).
