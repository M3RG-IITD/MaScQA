Using the Hall-Petch equation, we have:

$\sigma_f = \sigma_0 + k_y\cdot d^{-1/2}$

where:
$\sigma_f$ = lattice frictional stress
$\sigma_0$ = a constant (the frictional stress at infinite grain size)
$k_y$ = Hall-Petch constant (a measure of the effectiveness of grain boundaries in stopping dislocation motion)
$d$ = grain size

Rearranging the equation, we can solve for grain size:

$d = \left(\dfrac{k_y}{\sigma_f-\sigma_0}\right)^2$

Plugging in the values given in the problem:

$d = \left(\dfrac{0.10\text{ MN}/m^{1.5}}{100\text{ MN}/m^2 - \sigma_0}\right)^2$

We do not have a value for $\sigma_0$, so we cannot calculate an exact grain size. However, we can use the fact that ASTM No. 6 corresponds to a range of grain sizes between 18.2 µm and 22.4 µm. Therefore, we can eliminate options (C) and (D) as they are much smaller than this range.

Option (A) of 45 µm is larger than the range associated with ASTM No. 6, so it is also unlikely.

Therefore, the best answer is (B) 35 µm, which is within the expected range for ASTM No. 6 and seems reasonable given the other values provided in the problem.
