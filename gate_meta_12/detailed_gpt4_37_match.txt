Let's analyze each process and match it to the corresponding metal:

P. Matte smelting: This process involves heating a mixture of metal sulfides, typically copper sulfides, to separate the metals from the sulfur. So, P matches with 2. Copper.

Q. Cyanide leaching: Cyanide leaching is a hydrometallurgical method where gold is extracted from ores by reacting with a cyanide solution. This process is used to extract gold from low-grade ores. So, Q matches with 3. Gold.

R. Carbothermic reduction: In this process, a metal oxide is reduced to the corresponding metal by heating it with a carbon source, such as coke. This method is typically used for the reduction of lead oxide to lead. So, R matches with 1. Lead.

S. Fused salt electrolysis: Fused salt electrolysis involves dissolving a metal compound in a molten salt and then passing an electric current through the resulting mixture to extract the metal. This process is commonly used to extract aluminum from its ore, alumina. So, S matches with 4. Aluminium.

Based on these matches, the correct option is: 
(B) P-2, Q-3, R-1, S-4
