We can first find the true strain (ε) for the cold rolling process using the following equation for the true strain:

ε = ln (A₀ / A), 

where A₀ is the initial area and A is the final area.

For the problem given, the initial diameter (d₀) is 10 mm and the final diameter (d) is 5 mm. We can find the initial and final areas using the formula for the area of a circle:

A₀ = (π / 4) (d₀^2) = (π / 4) (10^2) = 25π mm²
A = (π / 4) (d^2) = (π / 4) (5^2) = 6.25π mm²

Now we can find the true strain (ε):

ε = ln (A₀ / A) = ln (25π / 6.25π) = ln(4)

Now, we can use the given equation for the strain-hardening behavior to find the drawing stress (σ):

σ = 700 (ε)^0.2 = 700 (ln(4))^0.2

Calculate the value of σ:

σ ≈ 700 × (1.386)^0.2 ≈ 442.54 MPa

The approximate drawing stress is 450 MPa, so the answer is (C).

Correct answer: [450 MPa]
