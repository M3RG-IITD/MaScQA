To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

1. Find the true strain (ε) during the drawing process.
2. Use the strain hardening equation to calculate the flow stress (σ) at the true strain value.
3. Choose the correct answer from the given options.

Step 1: Find the true strain (ε) during the drawing process

In the drawing process, we are decreasing the diameter from 10 mm to 5 mm. The true strain can be calculated using the following formula:

ε = ln(A_final / A_initial)

where A_final and A_initial are the final and initial cross-sectional areas of the wire, respectively.

Since we are given the diameters (d_final = 5 mm and d_initial = 10 mm), we can calculate the areas using the formula for the area of a circle:

A = (π/4) * d^2

A_final = (π/4) * (5 mm)^2 = (π/4) * 25 mm^2
A_initial = (π/4) * (10 mm)^2 = (π/4) * 100 mm^2

Now we can calculate the true strain:

ε = ln(A_final / A_initial) = ln((π/4) * 25 mm^2 / (π/4) * 100 mm^2) = ln(0.25) = -1.386

Step 2: Use the strain hardening equation to calculate the flow stress (σ) at the true strain value.

We are now given the strain hardening behavior for the cold rolled rod in the following equation:

σ = 700 * (ε)^0.2 MPa

Plugging in the calculated true strain (ε) value:

σ = 700 * (-1.386)^0.2 MPa

Now we can calculate the flow stress during the drawing process:

σ = 700 * 0.781 MPa ≈ 546.73 MPa

Step 3: Choose the correct answer from the given options

Finally, we choose the closest answer from the given options:

(A) 650 MPa
(B) 550 MPa
(C) 450 MPa
(D) 400 MPa

Since 546.73 MPa is closest to 550 MPa, the correct answer is (B) 550 MPa.

Answer: [(B) 550 MPa]
