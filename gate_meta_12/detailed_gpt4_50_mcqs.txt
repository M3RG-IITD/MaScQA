Unfortunately, I cannot see the image you are referring to. But I can help you understand the concept of stress ratio, and how to solve problems related to it.

The stress ratio is defined as the ratio of the stress applied to a material during a specific loading condition to the stress applied during a reference loading condition. Usually, the reference loading condition is either the yield stress, which is the stress at which the material starts to deform permanently or the ultimate stress, which is the maximum stress that a material can withstand before it fractures.

In the case of stress ratio problems, you likely have been given some information about the stress applied to a material and the stress at which it yields or breaks. Then, you can use the following formula to find the stress ratio:

Stress Ratio = (Applied Stress) / (Reference Stress)

Let's assume you are given the following information: 

1. The applied stress is 8 MPa.
2. The yield stress is 2 MPa.

Now, substitute these values into the formula to calculate the stress ratio:

Stress Ratio = (8 MPa) / (2 MPa) = 4

In this example, the stress ratio is 4. If you can provide me the information given in your problem, I can help you solve for the correct stress ratio. Remember to put your final answer inside a list like: [Correct answer]
