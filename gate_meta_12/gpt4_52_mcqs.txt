To solve this problem, we can use the Hall-Petch equation, which relates the frictional stress to grain size:

σ = σ0 + K * d^(-1/2)

Where σ is the lattice frictional stress, σ0 is the yield stress in the absence of grain boundaries (not required in this problem), K is the Hall-Petch constant, and d is the grain size in meters.

In this problem, we have:
σ = 100 MN/m² = 100 * 10^6 N/m²
K = 0.10 MN/m^(1.5) = 0.10 * 10^6 N/m^(1.5)
ASTM No. 6 grain size = n

Using the ASTM grain size number equation:
n = (- log2(d (in mm))) - 1

First, we need to find the grain size in millimeters:

d (in mm) = 2^(-n + 1)

Now, let's plug in the values and solve for d in meters:

100 * 10^6 = 0 + 0.10 * 10^6 * (d)^(-1/2)
100 = 0.10 * d^(-1/2)
1000 = d^(-1/2)
d^(-1/2) = 1000
d = (1/1000)^(-2)
d = 1000^2
d = 1,000,000 µm

Now, dividing by 1000 to get the value in mm:

d (in mm) = 1,000,000 µm / 1000 = 1000 mm

Now, we can find the ASTM grain size number:

n = (- log2(d (in mm))) - 1
n = (- log2(1000)) - 1
n ≈ -9.97 - 1
n ≈ -10.97

The grain size is around 45 µm. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 45 µm.

Answer: [(A) 45 µm]
