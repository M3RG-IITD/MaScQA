To find the correct answer, let's understand each process and its application.

A) Extrusion:
Extrusion is a process used to create objects of a fixed cross-sectional profile by pushing material through a die with the desired shape. It's commonly used for manufacturing long parts with constant cross-section like pipes and tubes, window frames, etc.

B) Wire drawing:
Wire drawing process, also known as wireworking or wiredrawing, is the manufacturing method used to reduce the diameter of a round metallic wire by pulling it through progressively small dies or plates. The process is suitable for the production of thin and long wires, such as electrical conductors, cables, and more.

C) Casting:
Casting is a manufacturing process that involves pouring molten metal into a mold cavity and allowing it to cool and solidify. This process takes the shape of the mold's cavity and can be used to make complex, three-dimensional objects. It's widely used for making various metal components in industries such as automotive, aerospace, and machinery.

D) Powder metallurgy:
Powder metallurgy is the process of manufacturing metal parts or components by compressing metal powder in a die followed by sintering at elevated temperatures. The sintering process causes the powder particles to fuse together and results in a solid piece. It's used for manufacturing various components, including gears, bearings, filters, and electronic contacts.

Now, let's consider the case of tungsten filament.

Tungsten filaments are used in electric bulbs due to their high melting point and ability to emit light when heated. The filament is usually formed by a thin wire with a uniform diameter. To create such a wire, the tungsten material should be processed using a method that can create long, thin wires with consistent diameter and a high level of precision.

Considering the given options, wire drawing (B) is the most suitable process for manufacturing tungsten filaments. It allows the production of thin and long wires with consistent diameter, which is crucial for the performance of the electric bulb.

Answer: [B]
