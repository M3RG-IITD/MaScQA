Let's solve this step by step. 

Given a thin layer of material B of total amount m, plated on the end faces of two long rods of material A, the diffusion coefficient of B in A is D. We need to find the composition profile $c_B$ along the rod axis x after a time t.

According to Fick's Second Law of diffusion, the concentration of species B, $c_B$, in material A along the x-axis is given by:

$\frac{\partial c_B}{\partial t} = D * \frac{\partial^2 c_B}{\partial x^2}$

Let's analyze the initial and boundary conditions:

1. Initially, at t = 0, material B is located entirely on the end faces of rods A:

$c_B(x,0) = \frac{m}{\sqrt{2\pi}}*e^{-\frac{x^2}{2}}$

2. Boundary conditions. For all time t, at x = 0 and x = infinity:

$c_B(0, t) = m$ and $c_B(\infty, t) = 0$

In order to solve the diffusion equation, we must use the complementary error function (erf). The complementary error function of variable u is defined as:

$erf(u) = 1 - \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}*\int_{0}^{u} e^{-t^{2}} dt$

Now, by comparing the given expressions with the initial and boundary conditions, Option A and Option D do not match the boundary conditions. Therefore, we have only Option B and Option C remaining.

Taking the derivative of both Option B and Option C with respect to x:

The derivative of Option B with respect to x:

$-\frac{m}{\sqrt{4\pi Dt}} * exp(-\frac{x^2}{4Dt}) * \frac{x}{2Dt}$

The derivative of Option C with respect to x:

$\frac{m}{\sqrt{4\pi Dt}} * exp(-\frac{x^2}{4Dt}) * \frac{x}{2Dt}$

Since the diffusion process in material A is spreading material B, we expect the composition profile $c_B$ to decrease with increasing x. Thus, the derivative of the correct expression should be negative with respect to x.

Comparing the derivatives of Option B and Option C, we can see that the derivative of Option B is negative, while the derivative of Option C is positive. Therefore, the correct answer is Option B.

So, the composition profile $c_B$ along the rod axis x after a time t is given by:

$c_B$ = (m/2$(Ï€*D*t)^(0.5)$) * erf[-$x^(2)$/4*D*t]

Correct answer: [B]
