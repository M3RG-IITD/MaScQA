We can use the Arrhenius equation to solve this problem:

k = A * exp(-Ea/RT)

where k is the rate constant, A is the pre-exponential factor, Ea is the activation energy, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/molÂ·K), and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

To triple the rate constant, we need to multiply it by 3. Therefore, we can write:

3k = A * exp(-Ea/RT)

Dividing this equation by the original Arrhenius equation will eliminate the pre-exponential factor:

3k / k = (A * exp(-Ea/RT)) / (A * exp(-Ea/RT))

3 = exp(-Ea/RT) / exp(-Ea/(8.314*300))

Simplifying and solving for T:

ln(3) = -Ea/R * (1/T - 1/300)

T = (-Ea/R) / (ln(3)/300 - 1/300)

Plugging in the values given in the problem:

T = (-8.314 kJ/mol) / (ln(3)/300 - 1/300) = 600.5 K

Therefore, the answer is (C) 600.5 K.
