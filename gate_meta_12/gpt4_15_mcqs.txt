Using Bragg's law:

nλ = 2dsinθ

where n is the order of diffraction (let's assume n = 1), λ is the wavelength, d is the interplanar spacing, and θ is the angle of diffraction.

For an fcc lattice, the {hkl} planes spacing is given by:

d = a/sqrt(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)

For {311} planes, h=3, k=1, l=1, therefore:

d = a/sqrt(3^2 + 1^2+ 1^2)
d = a/sqrt(11)

Now using Bragg's law, we get:

1 * 0.154 nm = 2 * (a/sqrt(11)) * sin(78/2)
0.154 = 2 * (a/sqrt(11)) * sin(39°)

Solving for the lattice parameter a:

a = (0.154 * sqrt(11)) / (2 * sin(39°))
a ≈ 0.403 nm

The correct answer is approximately 0.4 nm. Therefore, the answer is:
