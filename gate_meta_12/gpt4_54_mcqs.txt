We are given that the strain hardening behavior of an annealed rod during cold rolling is given by the equation:

σ = 700 * (ε)^0.2 MPa

We are asked to find the flow stress after a 50% reduction in the area of the annealed rod. Since the material is being cold rolled, we can assume that the deformation is uniform and that the volume remains constant. Therefore, we can use the following equation:

A_1 * L_1 = A_2 * L_2

We know that the area is reduced by 50%, so A_2 = A_1 * 0.5. Using the above equation, we get:

L_2 = (A_1 * L_1) / (A_1 * 0.5) = 2 * L_1

Now, we need to find the strain ε caused due to this deformation. We can use the logarithmic (true) strain equation:

ε = ln(L_2/L_1) = ln(2*L_1 / L_1) = ln(2)

Now, we can substitute this strain value in our strain hardening equation to get the flow stress:

σ = 700 * (ln(2))^0.2 MPa

Evaluating the expression:

σ ≈ 609 MPa

Hence, the flow stress after 50% reduction in the area of the annealed rod on cold rolling is approximately 609 MPa, which corresponds to option (C).
