To solve this problem, we will use the Griffith's criterion for the fracture of brittle materials, which states that the critical stress for fracture is given by:

σ_c = Y * K_c / (π*a)^0.5

where:

- σ_c is the critical stress for fracture (fracture stress)
- Y is a constant that depends on the geometry of the crack
- K_c is the fracture toughness of the material (a material property)
- a is the crack length

Since we are considering the same material, K_c and Y remain constant. Thus, the relationship between fracture stress and crack length can be written as:

σ_c ∝ 1 / (a^0.5)

Now we have the values for the fracture stress and crack length for two different cases:

Case 1: 
Crack length, a1 = 1 µm
Fracture stress, σ_c1 = 200 MPa

Case 2: 
Crack length, a2 = 4 µm
Fracture stress, σ_c2 = ?

We can now form the proportion:

σ_c1 / σ_c2 = (a2^0.5) / (a1^0.5)

Plugging in the given values:

200 / σ_c2 = (4^0.5) / (1^0.5)

200 / σ_c2 = 2 / 1

σ_c2 = 200 / 2

σ_c2 = 100 MPa

So, the fracture stress for the same material having a crack length of 4 µm is:

Answer: (C) 100 MPa
