To solve this question, we have to match the processes in Group I with their respective objectives in Group II.

Group I:
P. Vacuum Arc Degassing (VAD)
Q. LD (Linz-Donawitz) Process
R. COREX (COke-free Reactor EXport) Process
S. Blast Furnace

Group II:
1. Primary iron making
2. Secondary steel making
3. Direct smelting
4. Primary steel making

Let's analyze options:

A) P-3, Q-4, R-2, S-1
 B) P-4, Q-3, R-1, S-2
 C) P-3, Q-2, R-1, S-4
 D) P-2, Q-4, R-3, S-1


Matching the processes with objectives:

P. Vacuum Arc Degassing (VAD) - This is a process to remove impurities (such as hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon) from steel. It is used for secondary steel making.
→ P matches with 2.

Q. LD (Linz-Donawitz) Process - Also known as Basic Oxygen Steelmaking (BOS), this process is used to convert molten pig iron into steel by blowing oxygen through the molten pig iron. It is a primary steelmaking process.
→ Q matches with 4.

R. COREX (COke-free Reactor EXport) Process - This process is an environmentally-friendly alternative to traditional blast furnace-based ironmaking. It allows the production of pig iron without the need for coke. It is used for primary ironmaking.
→ R matches with 1.

S. Blast Furnace - The blast furnace process is used for the production of pig iron from iron ore, coke, and limestone. It is the primary iron-making process.
→ S matches with 1.

Now, comparing the matchings with the options:

A) P-3, Q-4, R-2, S-1 - Incorrect because P and R do not match the correct numbers.
B) P-4, Q-3, R-1, S-2 - Incorrect because only R matches the correct number.
C) P-3, Q-2, R-1, S-4 - Incorrect because only R and Q match the correct numbers.
D) P-2, Q-4, R-3, S-1 - Correct because P, Q, R, and S match the correct numbers.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) P-2, Q-4, R-3, S-1.
