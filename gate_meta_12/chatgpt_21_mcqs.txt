The given polymer matrix composite contains long continuous ceramic fibers aligned in one direction.

We need to find the Young’s modulus of the composite $E_C$ in a direction perpendicular to the length of fibers.

Since the fibers are aligned in one direction, we can assume that the stress is transferred mainly in that direction. Therefore, we can assume that the stress in the composite is the same as the stress in the fibers.

Let us assume that the stress in the fibers and composite is σ.

The strain in the fibers and composite will be given by:

ε_f = σ/E_f   and   ε_C = σ/E_C

The volume fraction of the fibers is f. Therefore, the volume fraction of the matrix is (1-f).

By the rule of mixtures, the Young's modulus of the composite perpendicular to the fiber direction is given by:

E_C = σ/ε_C = (σ/ε_f) / (f + (1-f)(E_m/E_f))

Since we assume iso-stress condition, we have σ is same for both fibers and composite

thus,

E_C = E_f / (f + (1-f)(E_m/E_f))

Simplifying the expression, we get:

 E_C = f E_f + (1-f) E_m/ (1)

Hence, the correct option is (A)  $E_C$ = (1-f)$E_m$ + f$E_f$

The option (B) is incorrect because it represents the expression for the Young's modulus of the composite parallel to the fiber direction.

The options (C) and (D) are also incorrect because they do not represent the correct expression for the Young's modulus of the composite perpendicular to the fiber direction.
