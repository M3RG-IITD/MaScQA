Firstly, it is important to understand the crystal structures of each phase of steel. Ferrite and cementite have BCC (body-centered cubic) and orthorhombic structures, respectively. Austenite has an FCC (face-centered cubic) structure, while martensite has a BCT (body-centered tetragonal) structure.

Now, we can proceed with matching the phases of steel in Group I with the crystal structures in Group II as follows:

- Ferrite: BCC structure → Match with option (A)-S-2
- Cementite: Orthorhombic structure → Match with option (A)-Q-4
- Austenite: FCC structure → Match with option (A)-R-1
- Martensite: BCT structure → Match with option (A)-P-3

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) P-3, Q-4, R-1, S-2.
