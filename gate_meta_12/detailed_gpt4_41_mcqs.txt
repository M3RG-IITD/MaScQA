To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of recrystallization.

Recrystallization is a process by which deformed grains of a crystal structure are replaced by a new set of defect-free grains that nucleate and grow until the original grains have been entirely consumed. This occurs in materials that have been cold-worked, which refers to plastic deformation below the recrystallization temperature.

Now let's analyze each statement:

(A) Higher the amount of cold work, lower is the recrystallization temperature
- This statement is correct because as the amount of cold work increases, the level of defects (dislocations, vacancies, etc.) in the crystal lattice increases, thus promoting the process of recrystallization at lower temperatures.

(B) Higher the recovery, higher is the recrystallization temperature
- This statement is correct because recovery is a process where some of the defects induced by cold work are removed due to thermal activation of atoms (annealing). As recovery progresses, defects decrease and it requires higher recrystallization temperature to promote new nucleation and growth of defect-free grains.

(C) Higher the temperature of cold work, higher is the recrystallization temperature
- This statement is correct because as the temperature of cold work increases, the mobility of atoms and defects within the material also increases, which reduces the driving force for recrystallization. As a result, higher recrystallization temperature is required to achieve the same amount of defect-free grains.

(D) Finer the initial grain size, higher is the recrystallization temperature
- This statement is NOT correct because finer initial grain size has more grain boundaries, which act as nucleation sites for the new defect-free grains during recrystallization. This generally results in a lower recrystallization temperature, as the process is facilitated by the presence of these boundaries.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
