Agglomeration is a process of making bulk materials or minerals bind together to form larger and denser particles. Therefore, the process that does not involve the formation of larger and denser particles is not an agglomeration process. Following are the steps involved in each of the given processes:

(A) Nodulizing: In this process, iron ore fines, coke breeze, limestone, and water are mixed and granulated to form nodules, which are then sintered to form strong pellets.

(B) Briquetting: In this process, a binder or a mixture of binders is added to the fine particles of the material, which are then compressed into the desired shape and size under high pressure.

(C) Roasting: It is a process of heating the ore in the presence of excess air or oxygen to convert the sulfide minerals into oxides, which can then be easily separated from the gangue minerals.

(D) Pelletizing: In this process, finely ground iron ore is mixed with a binder and water, which is then rolled into pellets and hardened by heating.

Therefore, the answer is (C) Roasting, as it is not a process of making bulk materials or minerals bind together to form larger and denser particles.
