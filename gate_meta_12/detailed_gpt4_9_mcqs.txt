An equilibrium defect is a type of defect that is formed during the crystal's growth and is stable at a particular temperature and pressure. These defects are essential for maintaining the thermodynamic equilibrium of the crystal.

Now, let's analyze each option to determine the equilibrium defect among them.

(A) Vacancies: 
A vacancy is a point defect in a crystal lattice where an atom or an ion is missing from its regular lattice site. This type of defect is formed during the growth of the crystal and exists in the lattice in proportion to temperature and pressure. When the crystal cools down, some of the vacancies may remain, maintaining the equilibrium state of the crystal. Therefore, vacancies can be considered as equilibrium defects.

(B) Dislocations:
Dislocations are line defects in a crystal lattice, which occur when the regular arrangement of atoms or ions is disrupted. In general, dislocations are not equilibrium defects because they are formed as a result of external stresses such as mechanical deformation, temperature gradients, or chemical concentration gradients. However, some dislocations can result from the growth process and be stable at a particular temperature and pressure.

(C) Stacking faults:
Stacking faults are planar defects in a crystal lattice, where a sequence of atomic planes is interrupted, resulting in a break in the normal stacking sequence. Stacking faults are typically formed due to the interruption of the growth process, and they are not considered equilibrium defects, since they do not contribute to the thermodynamic stability of the crystal.

(D) Grain boundaries:
Grain boundaries are the interfaces between two crystallites or grains in a polycrystalline material. They occur when two crystallites grow together and their lattice orientations do not match perfectly. Grain boundaries are not equilibrium defects because they are associated with the bulk shape and structure of a material rather than the atomic arrangement within the individual crystals.

In conclusion, among the given options, vacancies (A) are equilibrium defects as they form during the crystal growth and contribute to maintaining the thermodynamic equilibrium of the crystal structure.

The correct answer is: [A]
