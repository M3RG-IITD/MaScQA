Agglomeration is a process that deals with the collection and assembly of particles or objects into masses, clusters, or groupings. It is commonly used in various industries to transform fine materials into larger, more manageable particles.

Let's examine each option:

(A) Nodulizing:
Nodulizing is an agglomeration process that facilitates the transformation of fine particles or grains into small spherical nodules. This process is often used in the metallurgical industry to prepare ores and helps enhance product characteristics like furnace reaction, permeability, and bulk density.

(B) Briquetting:
Briquetting is an agglomeration technique in which fine materials or waste materials are compacted under high pressure, resulting in larger particles or blocks. This process is used in various industries, including metallurgy, to create a higher density product and improve handling, transportation, and storage.

(C) Roasting:
Roasting is a process that involves heating a material, such as an ore, to high temperatures in the presence of air or oxygen. This process is utilized to extract metals from their ores or remove impurities, such as sulfur and carbonates, but it does not agglomerate any particles. Hence, roasting is not an agglomeration process.

(D) Pelletizing:
Pelletizing is the process of creating small, rounded pellets from fine materials using a combination of moisture, heat, and pressure. The process is widely used in various industries, including iron and steel production, to improve product quality and ease handling.

So, the correct answer is (C) Roasting. It is not an agglomeration process.

Answer: [C].
