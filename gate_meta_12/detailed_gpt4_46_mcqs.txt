To determine the correctness of the Assertion (a) and Reason (r), let's break down the statements and understand their meaning.

Assertion (a): During rolling, front tension and (or) back tension are (is) employed to decrease the rolling load.

- Rolling is a metalworking process in which metal is deformed by passing it through a set of rolls, which compresses, stretches and bends the metal.
- Front tension refers to tension applied to the metal strip as it enters the roll gap, while back tension refers to tension applied as it exits the roll gap.
- Rolling load is the force required to overcome the friction, deformation, and separation/exit of the material from the rolls.

Reason (r): Roll pressure decreases due to the lowering of flow stress as a result of front tension/back tension.

- Roll pressure is the force exerted on the metal as it goes through the rolls.
- Flow stress is the stress required to cause deformation in the metal.
- When front tension or back tension is applied, the flow stress is reduced because the metal is already in tension before it enters the roll gap.

Let's evaluate the correctness of these statements.

- The assertion (a) is true because applying front tension and/or back tension during rolling can reduce the rolling load. This is because the metal enters the roll gap with some degree of tension, making it easier for the rolls to deform the material.

- The reason (r) is also true. When front tension and/or back tension is applied, it lowers the flow stress of the material. As a result, the roll pressure, which is directly related to the flow stress, also decreases.

- Furthermore, the reason (r) is indeed the reason for the assertion (a) being true. The decrease in rolling load is due to the reduction of roll pressure, which in turn is a result of a lowered flow stress caused by the front tension/back tension.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(C) a is true and r is also true, and r is the reason for a.
