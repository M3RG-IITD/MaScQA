Floatation beneficiation, also known as froth flotation, is a process used to separate minerals based on the differences in their surface properties. It is a widely used technique for the recovery and upgrading of sulfide ores. 

Now let's analyze each given option to understand which one is the correct principle for floatation beneficiation.

(A) Mineral surface hydrophobicity:
In floatation beneficiation, the mineral particles are selectively attached to air bubbles, while the undesired particles settle in the water. The surface hydrophobicity of minerals plays a significant role in this process, as hydrophobic particles tend to attach more easily to air bubbles, while hydrophilic particles remain in the water. So, this option seems to be correct.

(B) Gravity difference:
Gravity difference is the principle behind a different mineral separation process called gravity separation. In gravity separation, heavier particles settle at the bottom of the container, while lighter particles rise to the top. Although floatation is affected by particle density to some extent, it is not the primary principle governing the process.

(C) Chemical reactivity:
Chemical reactivity plays a part in modifying the surface properties of minerals to some extent during floatation beneficiation. Collectors and modifiers are chemicals used to enhance the hydrophobicity of desired minerals or depress the flotation of undesired minerals. While it does have a role, it is not the main principle behind the process.

(D) Particle size difference:
In general, mineral processing techniques are influenced by the particle size of the materials undergoing separation. However, the particle size difference is not the main principle behind floatation beneficiation. It's worth mentioning that floatation is more effective for fine particles, while other methods like gravity separation work better for coarse particles.

Based on the analysis above, the correct answer is:
