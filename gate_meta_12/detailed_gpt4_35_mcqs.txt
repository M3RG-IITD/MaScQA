To solve this problem, we need to use the relation between the Gibbs free energy and the reaction equilibrium constant. The ∆G° for the reaction can be expressed as:

∆G° = -RT ln(K)

Here, R is the universal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T is the temperature (1173 K), and K is the equilibrium constant.

We are given ∆G° = 8120 J and T = 1173 K. We can solve for K:

-8120 = -8.314 * 1173 * ln(K)

Now, divide both sides by -8.314 * 1173:

ln(K) = 0.9371

To get K, exponentiate both sides:

K = e^(0.9371) = 2.552

The equilibrium constant K can also be expressed in terms of the pressures of each substance. For the given reaction:

K = $(p_(Fe) p_(CO_2))/(p_(FeO) p_(CO))$

Since p_(Fe) and p_(FeO) are in the solid phase, their pressures will not have any significant effect on the equilibrium. Thus, we can approximate K as follows:

K ≈ $(p_(CO_2))/(p_(CO))$

Now, we're asked to find the ratio $p_(CO)/p_(CO_2)$. To express this in terms of K, we can simply invert the expression for K:

$(p_(CO)/p_(CO_2))$ = 1/K = 1/2.552 = 0.3917

This value is closest to the given option (C) 0.44. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(C) 0.44
