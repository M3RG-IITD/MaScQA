The strain hardening behaviour of an annealed rod during cold rolling is given by σ = 700 $(ε)^0.2$ MPa, where σ is the flow stress at strain ε. If a wire of 5 mm diameter is drawn from the above cold rolled rod of 10 mm diameter, the drawing stress, neglecting the effect of friction and redundant work, is approximately
(A) 650 MPa (B) 550 MPa (C) 450 MPa (D) 400 MPa
