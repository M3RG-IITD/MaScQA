We can use the fracture mechanics equation for brittle materials:

σ = K_I / sqrt(a)

where σ is the fracture stress, K_I is the stress intensity factor, and a is the length of the crack.

Assuming that the stress intensity factor is constant, we can write:

σ1 / sqrt(a1) = σ2 / sqrt(a2)

where σ1 and a1 are the fracture stress and crack length for the first case, and σ2 and a2 are the fracture stress and crack length for the second case.

Plugging in the values, we get:

200 / sqrt(1) = σ2 / sqrt(4)

Solving for σ2, we get:

σ2 = 100 MPa

Therefore, the answer is (C) 100 MPa.
