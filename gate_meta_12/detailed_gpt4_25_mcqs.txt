Radiography is a non-destructive testing technique used to detect defects or discontinuities in materials such as metal, concrete, and composite structures. This technique is based on the principle of (D) Absorption.

Let's discuss the radiography process step by step:

1. Selection of source: Depending on the material to be tested and the level of detail required, a suitable source of radiation is selected. Common radiation sources are X-rays and gamma rays.

2. Exposure: The selected radiation source is placed on one side of the object, and a detector or film is placed on the other side. The object being tested is exposed to the radiation for a specific period, allowing the radiation to pass through it.

3. Absorption: As the radiation passes through the object, it gets absorbed depending on the thickness and density of the material. Thicker and denser areas absorb more radiation, while thinner and less dense areas allow more radiation to pass through.

4. Formation of radiographic image: After passing through the object, the radiation exposes the detector or film, leaving a pattern or image representing the internal structure of the object. Areas where more radiation passes through appear as lighter shades on the image, while areas where less radiation passes through appear as darker shades.

5. Interpretation: The radiographic image is analyzed by qualified technicians to identify any defects or discontinuities in the material. Defects such as cracks, voids, or porosities can be detected due to their distinct appearance on the radiographic image.

In summary:

Radiography technique of detecting defects is based on the principle of (D) Absorption, which allows for the creation of detailed images of the internal structure of materials, helping in the identification of defects or discontinuities.
