P. Hydrogen electrode is a standard used to measure redox potentials: This statement is true. The hydrogen electrode is often used as a reference electrode when measuring the potential of other electrodes in a half-cell.

Q. Activation polarization refers to electrochemical processes controlled by reaction sequence at metal-solution interface: This statement is true. Activation polarization can occur when the rate of an electrode reaction is influenced by the activation energy required for the reaction to take place.

R. Potential-pH diagrams can be used to predict corrosion rates of metals: This statement is false. While potential-pH diagrams can be used to predict the stability of different species in a solution, they do not directly predict corrosion rates of metals.

S. Cathodic protection can use sacrificial anodes such as magnesium: This statement is true. Cathodic protection is a technique used to prevent the corrosion of a metal surface by making it the cathode in an electrochemical cell. Sacrificial anodes, such as magnesium or zinc, can be used to provide the cathodic protection.

Therefore, the correct combination of statements is (C) P, Q and S.
