The correct answer is: 

(C) P-3, Q-4, R-2, S-1

Explanation:

- Martensite is a distorted and supersaturated body-centered cubic (bcc) phase, so it matches with option 3.
- Cementite is an iron carbide with an orthorhombic crystal structure, so it matches with option 4.
- Austenite is a face-centered cubic (fcc) phase, so it matches with option 2.
- Ferrite is a body-centered cubic (bcc) phase, so it matches with option 1.
