Given, 

The flow stress (σ) of an alloy varies with strain rate (ε) as σ = 100* $(ε)^(0.1)$ MPa. 

The diameter of the alloy changes from 10 cm to 5 cm.

The speed of extrusion is 2 cm/s.

We need to find out the flow stress.

We can use the following formula to calculate the flow stress for a metal during hot working process:

$\sigma = K \times \epsilon^n$

Where,
$k$ and $n$ are constants which are specific to the material being processed.

Here, 

$k$ = 100 MPa

$n$ = 0.1

Let's calculate the strain rate using the formula:

$\epsilon = \frac{v \ln(\frac{r_i}{r_f})}{L}$

Where,

$v$ = Speed of extrusion = 2 cm/s

$r_i$ = Initial radius = 5 cm/2 = 2.5 cm

$r_f$ = Final radius = 2.5 cm/2= 1.25 cm

$L$ = Length of the extruded part (let's assume it to be 10 cm)

Plugging in the values, we get:

$\epsilon = \frac{2 \ln(\frac{2.5}{1.25})}{10}$

$\epsilon = 0.276$ 

Now we can calculate the flow stress using the formula:

$\sigma = K \times \epsilon^n$

Plugging in the values we get:

$\sigma = 100 \times (0.276)^{0.1}$

$\sigma = 105.08$ MPa

Therefore, the flow stress is approximately 105 MPa.

Hence, the answer is option (B) 105 MPa.
