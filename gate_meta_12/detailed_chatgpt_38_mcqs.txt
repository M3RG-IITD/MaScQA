P. Bessemer converter can be used in copper smelting: FALSE. The Bessemer converter is a method of steelmaking, and is not suitable for copper smelting.

Q. The Mond process for nickel involves reaction of metal with H2 gas: TRUE. The Mond process for nickel involves heating high-purity nickel with hydrogen gas in the presence of a catalyst to form nickel carbonyl gas, which can be decomposed to yield pure nickel.

R. Roasted ZnS concentrates can be smelted in a blast furnace: TRUE. Roasting of ZnS (zinc sulfide) concentrates converts the zinc sulfide into zinc oxide, which can then be reduced to zinc metal in a blast furnace.

S. Magnesium metal can be produced by electrolysis of sea water: FALSE. While sea water does contain magnesium ions, the concentration is too low to make it economically viable to extract magnesium metal by electrolysis of sea water.

Therefore, the correct combination of statements is (D) Q and S.
