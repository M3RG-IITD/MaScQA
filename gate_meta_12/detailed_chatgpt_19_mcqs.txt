The property of a material that CANNOT be significantly changed by heat treatment is Elastic Modulus.

Explanation:

Heat treatment can alter the microstructure of a material by changing its mechanical properties such as Yield Strength, Ultimate Tensile Strength and Ductility. However, Elastic Modulus (also known as Young's Modulus) is a material property that is a measure of its stiffness, and is not affected much by heat treatment. It is a fundamental property of the material that is determined by its chemical composition and crystal structure. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Elastic Modulus.
