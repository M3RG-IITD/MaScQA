Step 1: Understand the question - This is a question related to welding processes. The question requires us to identify a process that is not a fusion welding process.

Step 2: Know the types of welding processes - There are two main types of welding processes - fusion welding and solid-state welding. In fusion welding, heat is applied to melt the base metals, and then the melted metals are allowed to solidify, thereby fusing them together. In solid-state welding, the base metals are not melted, but are joined together through the application of heat and pressure.

Step 3: Identify the fusion welding processes - Arc welding, gas welding, and friction stir welding are all examples of fusion welding processes. In arc welding, an electric arc is used to melt the base metals. In gas welding, a flame produced by mixing fuel gas and oxygen is used to melt the base metals. In friction stir welding, heat is generated by friction between a rotating tool and the base metals, causing the metals to soften and fuse together.

Step 4: Identify the solid-state welding process - Resistance welding is a solid-state welding process. In resistance welding, heat is generated by passing an electric current through the base metals, and the metals are then pressed together to form a solid-state weld.

Step 5: Determine the correct answer - The correct answer is (B) Gas welding, as it is not a solid-state welding process but a fusion welding process.

Answer: 
B) Gas welding
