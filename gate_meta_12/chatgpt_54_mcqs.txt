Given, 

Flow stress of an annealed rod during cold rolling = σ = 700 $(ε)^{0.2}$ MPa

The strain (ε) during 50% reduction in area of the annealed rod on cold rolling is given by:

ε = ln(Ao/Af) = ln(2) = 0.693

where Ao is the initial area and Af is the final area.

Substituting this value of ε in the given equation of flow stress, we get:

σf = 700 $(ε)^{0.2}$ = 700 $(0.693)^{0.2}$ = 609 MPa

Therefore, the flow stress after 50% reduction in area of the annealed rod on cold rolling is approximately 609 MPa.

Answer: (C) 609 MPa
