Let's first understand the crystal structures associated with each phase of steel in Group I:

P. Martensite: Martensite is a highly strained and very hard phase formed during the heat treatment process called quenching. It has a Body-Centered Tetragonal (bct) structure.

Q. Cementite: Cementite (also known as iron carbide, Fe3C) is a hard, brittle compound that appears in steel as a result of the decomposition of austenite. It has an Orthorhombic crystal structure.

R. Austenite: Austenite is a high-temperature phase of steel characterized by a Face-Centered Cubic (fcc) structure. It is important for heat treatment, as it can be transformed into martensite by rapid cooling (quenching) or into other microstructures by slower cooling.

S. Ferrite: Ferrite, also known as alpha iron, is a phases of steel with low carbon content and relatively soft and ductile. It has a Body-Centered Cubic (bcc) crystal structure.

Now let's match these with the crystal structures given in Group II:

P. Martensite - 3. bct
Q. Cementite - 4. Orthorhombic
R. Austenite - 2. fcc
S. Ferrite - 1. bcc

So, the correct answer is: (C) P-3, Q-4, R-2, S-1.
