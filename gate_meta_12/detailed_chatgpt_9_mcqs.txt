An equilibrium defect is a point defect that persists even at absolute zero. 

(A) Vacancies are point defects that occur when an atom is missing from its normal lattice site. They are an example of an equilibrium defect.

(B) Dislocations are a type of line defect that occur when there is a mismatch in the arrangement of atoms in a crystal structure. They are not an example of an equilibrium defect.

(C) Stacking faults are planar defects that occur when there is an error in the stacking sequence of crystal planes. They are not an example of an equilibrium defect.

(D) Grain boundaries are planar defects that occur when two grains with different crystal orientations meet. They are not an example of an equilibrium defect.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Vacancies. 

List of correct answer: 
- Vacancies.
