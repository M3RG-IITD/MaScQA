The tungsten filament used in an electric bulb is processed by wire drawing. Here are the steps involved in the process: 

1. Tungsten is extracted from its ores and is converted into tungsten oxide. 

2. Tungsten oxide is then reduced to tungsten metal powder by heating it in the presence of hydrogen gas. 

3. The tungsten metal powder is then mixed with a binder, usually a plastic material, to make a paste. 

4. This paste is extruded into a wire-like shape and then dried. 

5. The dried wires are then placed into a furnace and sintered at a high temperature to remove any remaining binder and to fuse the tungsten powder particles together. 

6. Finally, the sintered tungsten wires are drawn down to the desired size through a series of dies in a wire drawing machine. 

So, the correct answer is: 

- (B) Wire drawing
