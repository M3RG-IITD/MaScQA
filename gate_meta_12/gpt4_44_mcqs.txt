Fracture stress is inversely proportional to the square root of the crack length. Therefore, if the crack length increases by a factor of K, the fracture stress will decrease by a factor of √K.

In this case, the crack length increases from 1 µm to 4 µm, a factor of K = 4. Thus, the fracture stress will decrease by a factor of √4 = 2.

Fracture stress for a crack length of 1 µm is 200 MPa. So, the fracture stress for a crack length of 4 µm will be:

200 MPa / 2 = 100 MPa

The correct answer is (C) 100 MPa.

Final answer: [100]
