At equilibrium spacing, the net inter-atomic force is minimum (as the atoms are in a stable configuration), hence option C is correct.

However, the potential energy is not necessarily zero or minimum. At equilibrium spacing, potential energy is minimum because the attractive and repulsive inter-atomic forces are balanced. Therefore, option D is also partially correct.

So, the correct answer is:

- F is minimum and U is minimum (Option D)
