A unit dislocation can split into two partial dislocations such that the vector sum of their Burgers vectors would be equal to the Burgers vector of the unit dislocation.

Given the Burgers vector of the unit dislocation as (a/2)[1 -1 0]

Let the Burgers vectors of the two partial dislocations be A and B:
A = (a/6)[f_x f_y f_z] and B = (a/6)[g_x g_y g_z]
where f_x, f_y, f_z, g_x, g_y, g_z are the components of the Burgers vectors A and B respectively.

Since the sum of Burgers vectors A and B should be equal to the Burgers vector of the unit dislocation, we have:
A + B = (a/2)[1 -1 0]

Substituting the expressions for A and B, we get:
(a/6)[f_x f_y f_z] + (a/6)[g_x g_y g_z] = (a/2)[1 -1 0]

Now, two vectors are equal if their corresponding components are equal. Therefore, we have the following equations:
(1) f_x + g_x = 1
(2) f_y + g_y = -1
(3) f_z + g_z = 0

We now test each of the given options and see if they satisfy the above equations:

(A) A = (a/6)[2 -1 1] and B = (a/6)[1 -2 -1]
For A, f_x = 2, f_y = -1, f_z = 1
For B, g_x = 1, g_y = -2, g_z = -1
Adding A and B, we get: (a/6)[2 + 1, -1 + (-2), 1 + (-1)] = (a/6)[3, -3, 0], which is different from (a/2)[1 -1 0]. Hence, this option is incorrect.

(B) A = (a/6)[1 -1 2] and B = (a/6)[-1 -2 1]
For A, f_x = 1, f_y = -1, f_z = 2
For B, g_x = -1, g_y = -2, g_z = 1
Adding A and B, we get: (a/6)[1 + (-1), -1 + (-2), 2 + 1] = (a/6)[0, -3, 3], which is different from (a/2)[1 -1 0]. Hence, this option is incorrect.

(C) A = (a/6)[1 1 -2] and B = (a/6)[2 -1 -1]
For A, f_x = 1, f_y = 1, f_z = -2
For B, g_x = 2, g_y = -1, g_z = -1
Adding A and B, we get: (a/6)[1 + 2, 1 + (-1), -2 + (-1)] = (a/6)[3, 0, -3], which is different from (a/2)[1 -1 0]. Hence, this option is incorrect.

(D) A = (a/6)[2 1 1] and B = (a/6)[1 2 -1]
For A, f_x = 2, f_y = 1, f_z = 1
For B, g_x = 1, g_y = 2, g_z = -1
Adding A and B, we get: (a/6)[2 + 1, 1 + 2, 1 + (-1)] = (a/6)[3, 3, 0], which is different from (a/2)[1 -1 0]. Hence, this option is incorrect.

None of the given options satisfy the conditions set by the sum of Burgers vectors. Therefore, there might be a mistake in the question or the given options.
