Given, 
Strain hardening behaviour of an annealed rod during cold rolling is given by 
σ = 700 $(ε)^{0.2}$ MPa
Let's assume the original cross-sectional area of the rod as A and the final cross-sectional area as A/2, since there is a reduction of 50 % in area of the annealed rod due to cold rolling.
Let's also assume that the flow stress after 50% reduction in area is σf.
The true strain can be calculated as follows: 

True strain = ln (original length/ final length)  
Since the length of the rod remains constant during a cold rolling operation, the true strain can be written as: 

True strain = ln (original area/ final area) = ln (A/(1/2 A)) = ln 2 

Hence, the value of true strain is ln 2.

Using the strain hardening behaviour equation, we can write: 

σf = 700 ($(ln 2)^{0.2}$) MPa 

Solving this equation, we get 

σf ≈ 609 MPa

Therefore, the flow stress after 50% reduction in area of the annealed rod on cold rolling is approximately 609 MPa (Option C). 

Answer: 
(C) 609 MPa
