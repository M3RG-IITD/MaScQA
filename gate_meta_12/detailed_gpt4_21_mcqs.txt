Given a polymer matrix composite with long continuous ceramic fibres aligned in one direction, we need to determine the Young's modulus of the composite ($E_C$) in a direction perpendicular to the length of the fibres under iso-stress condition.

Step 1: Understand the iso-stress condition
Under iso-stress condition, the matrix and fibres have the same stress, i.e., σ_m = σ_f.

Step 2: Use the formula to calculate the strain in the matrix and the fibres
The strain in the matrix ($ε_m$) and the fibres ($ε_f$) can be calculated using Hooke's Law:
$ε_m$ = σ_m / $E_m$
$ε_f$ = σ_f / $E_f$

Since the matrix and fibres experience the same stress (σ_m = σ_f), we can rewrite the above equations as:
$ε_m$ = σ / $E_m$
$ε_f$ = σ / $E_f$

Step 3: Calculate the total strain in the composite
The composite material is a combination of both matrix and fibres, so the total strain in the composite ($ε_C$) is given by the weighted average of the individual strains:
$ε_C$ = (1-f)$ε_m$ + f$ε_f$

Step 4: Substitute the expressions for $ε_m$ and $ε_f$ in terms of stress
Now substitute the expressions for $ε_m$ and $ε_f$ from Step 2 in the equation for $ε_C$:
$ε_C$ = (1-f)(σ / $E_m$) + f(σ / $E_f$)

Step 5: Rearrange the terms in the equation
We can rearrange the terms and express $ε_C$ in terms of the composite stress (σ) and the composite Young's modulus ($E_C$):
$ε_C$ = σ / $E_C$

Step 6: Equate the expressions for $ε_C$
Now equate the expressions for $ε_C$ from Steps 5 and 4:
σ / $E_C$ = (1-f)(σ / $E_m$) + f(σ / $E_f$)

Step 7: Simplify the equation and solve for $E_C$
We can cancel the σ terms on both sides of the equation and solve for $E_C$:
1 / $E_C$ = (1-f) / $E_m$ + f / $E_f$

Hence the correct answer is (C) 1/$E_C$ = [(1-f)/$E_m$] + f/$E_f$.

Final answer: [C]
