Step 1: Determine the initial and final cross-sectional areas of the rod.

Let's denote the initial cross-sectional area of the annealed rod as A₀ and the final cross-sectional area after the 50% reduction in area as A₁.

Given that there is a 50% reduction in area, we can write:

A₁ = 0.5 * A₀

Step 2: Determine the relation between initial and final lengths of the rod.

Since the volume of the annealed rod remains constant during the cold rolling process, we can denote the initial length of the rod as L₀ and the final length as L₁. 

Let's assume the rod has a uniform shape along its length, so the volume of the rod can be expressed as:

V = A * L

Since the volume remains constant, we can write:

A₀ * L₀ = A₁ * L₁

Step 3: Calculate the true strain (ε).

Now we will find the true strain (ε) using the initial and final lengths of the rod. The true strain can be expressed as:

ε = ln(L₁ / L₀)

Using the relation between the initial and final cross-sectional areas found in step 1, we can rewrite the relation between initial and final lengths as:

A₀ * L₀ = (0.5 * A₀) * L₁

Dividing both sides of the equation by A₀:

L₀ = 0.5 * L₁

From this relation, we can express the ratio of the final to the initial length:

L₁ / L₀ = 2

Now we can substitute this into the equation for true strain:

ε = ln(2)

ε ≈ 0.693

Step 4: Calculate the flow stress (σ) after 50% reduction in area.

Now that we know the true strain, we can use the given equation for the strain hardening behavior of the annealed rod to calculate the flow stress:

σ = 700 * (ε)^0.2

Substitute ε = 0.693:

σ = 700 * (0.693)^0.2

σ ≈ 609 MPa

So the flow stress after a 50% reduction in the area of the annealed rod on cold rolling is approximately 609 MPa.

Answer: C) 609 MPa
