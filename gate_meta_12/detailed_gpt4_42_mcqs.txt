To solve this problem, we will be using the Young's equation, which relates the angle of contact (θ) with the surface tensions (interfacial energy) between different phases. The Young's equation states:

θ = cos^(-1)[($γ_(αδ)$ - $γ_(βδ)$)/$γ_(αβ)$]

Now, we can see from the expression above that the correct answer is:

(A) θ = $cos^(-1)$[$γ_(αδ)$ - $γ_(βδ)$/$γ_(αβ)$]

So, the correct answer is [A].
