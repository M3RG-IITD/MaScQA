At equilibrium spacing in a crystalline solid, the atoms are at their most stable positions, which can be determined by the forces between the atoms and the potential energy stored in the lattice.

The net inter-atomic force (F) is the net force resulting from the attractive and repulsive forces between neighboring atoms in a crystal lattice. At equilibrium spacing, the attractive and repulsive forces balance each other, resulting in zero net force. If the net force was not zero, the atoms would either move closer together or further apart.

The potential energy (U) of the crystalline solid is a function of the positions of the atoms in the lattice. At equilibrium spacing, this potential energy is at a minimum value. This is because the atoms are in their most stable positions, which correspond to the minimum potential energy configuration. To change the positions of the atoms and thus disturb the equilibrium, energy must be added to the system.

Therefore, the correct option is:

(B) F is zero and U is minimum

Answer: [(B) F is zero and U is minimum]
