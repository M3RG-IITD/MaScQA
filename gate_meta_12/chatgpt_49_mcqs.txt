The terminal velocity formula is given by $v_t$ = $\frac{2g(d_{p})^{2}(\rho_{p}-\rho_{l})}{9\eta}$, where g is the acceleration due to gravity, $d_{p}$ is the diameter of the steel particle, $\rho_{p}$ is the density of steel, $\rho_{l}$ is the density of liquid Al and $η$ is the viscosity of liquid Al.

We know that $\rho_{p}$ = 7200 kg/$m^3$, $\rho_{l}$ = 2360 kg/$m^3$ and $η$ = 1*10$^{-3}$ Pa.s.

The diameter of the steel ball is not given in the question, but we can assume that it is in the same range as the fine spherical steel particle mentioned in the question, i.e., in µm range. Therefore, we can take $d_{p}$ = R in our calculation.

The force exerted on the steel ball is given by $F$ = f π $R^{2}$ ($\rho_{l}$ $v^{2}$ /2).

At terminal velocity, the force exerted on the steel particle is equal and opposite to the weight of the particle, which is given by $W$ = $\frac{4}{3}$ π $(d_{p}/2)^{3}$ $\rho_{p}$ g.

Equating $F$ and $W$, we get f π $R^{2}$ ($\rho_{l}$ $v_{t}^{2}$ /2) = $\frac{4}{3}$ π $(d_{p}/2)^{3}$ $\rho_{p}$ g

Rearranging this equation, we get $v_t$ = $\sqrt{\frac{8gd_{p}^{2}(ρ_{p}-ρ_{l})}{9fR^{2}ρ_{l}}}$

Substituting the values, we get $v_t$ = 1.3*$10^6$ $d_{p}^{2}$ m/s

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 1.3*$10^6$ $d_{p}^{2}$ m/s.
