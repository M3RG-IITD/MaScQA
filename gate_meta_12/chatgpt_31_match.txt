The principles given in Group I and their corresponding corrosion terminology in Group II are:

- P. Electrode polarization -> 3. Over voltage
- Q. Passivity -> 4. Surface oxide film
- R. Selective leaching -> 1. Dezincification
- S. Grain boundary precipitation -> 2. Intergranular attack

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) P-3, Q-4, R-1, S-2.
