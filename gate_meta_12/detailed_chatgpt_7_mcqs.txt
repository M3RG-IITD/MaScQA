To solve this problem, we need to apply the principle of relative motion. We know that the fluid is flowing with a velocity of 0.5 m/s, and the plate is moving with a velocity of 0.01 m/s in the same direction. Therefore, the velocity of the fluid with respect to the plate is:

V_rel = V_fluid - V_plate
V_rel = 0.5 - 0.01
V_rel = 0.49 m/s

This means that the fluid is moving relative to the plate at a velocity of 0.49 m/s. Now, at the interface between the fluid and the plate, the two are in contact, so their velocities must be equal. Therefore, the velocity at the interface of the fluid and the plate is:

V_interface = V_rel + V_plate
V_interface = 0.49 + 0.01
V_interface = 0.50 m/s

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 0.50 m/s.
