Assuming that the material behaves in a homogeneous and isotropic manner, the flow stress during wire drawing can be assumed to be given by,

σ = K $(ε)^n$ = 700 $(ε)^0.2$ MPa

where K is the strength coefficient and n is the strain hardening exponent. 

During wire drawing, the cross-sectional area of the material decreases while the length of the material remains constant. The amount of reduction in area can be calculated as,

r = (D1^2 - D2^2)/D1^2 = (10^2 - 5^2)/10^2 = 0.75

where D1 is the initial diameter of the rod and D2 is the final diameter of the wire.

The drawing stress can be calculated as,

σd = K $(εd)^n$

where εd is the true strain during wire drawing. Assuming that the volume of the material remains constant during wire drawing and neglecting the effect of friction and redundant work, we can write,

εd = ln(V1/V2) = ln(A2/A1)

where V1 and A1 are the initial volume and cross-sectional area of the rod and V2 and A2 are the final volume and cross-sectional area of the wire.

Assuming that the density of the material remains constant and that the length of the material remains constant during wire drawing, we can write,

V1 = V2 + ΔV = L(A1 - A2)

where ΔV is the change in volume during wire drawing.

Substituting for V1 and V2 in the equation for εd and simplifying, we get,

εd = ln(A1/A2) = ln(1/r) = ln 4/3

Substituting for K, n, and εd in the equation for σd, we get,

σd = K $(εd)^n = 700 (ln 4/3)^0.2 ≈ 552 MPa

Therefore, the drawing stress, neglecting the effect of friction and redundant work, is approximately 552 MPa, which is closest to option (B) 550 MPa. 

Answer: (B) 550 MPa
