The velocity at the interface of the fluid and plate will be the sum of the velocity of the fluid and the velocity of the plate, since they are both moving in the same direction. Therefore, we have:

velocity at interface = velocity of fluid + velocity of plate
velocity at interface = 0.5 m/s + 0.01 m/s
velocity at interface = 0.51 m/s

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 0.50 m/s. 

Answer: 
- (D) 0.50 m/s
