We will analyze each welding process to determine which one is NOT a fusion welding process.

(A) Arc welding:
Arc welding is a fusion welding process that uses an electric arc to generate heat and join metal materials. In this process, an electrical current flows between the electrode (usually consumable) and the base metal, creating an arc that melts the base metal and the electrode, forming a weld pool that fuses the parts once it cools down. So, arc welding is a fusion welding process.

(B) Gas welding:
Gas welding, also known as oxy-fuel welding, is a fusion welding process that uses fuel gases (such as acetylene, hydrogen, or propane) and oxygen to create a flame with a high temperature to heat the metals to the melting point. Once the metal materials are heated to their melting points, they fuse together, and upon cooling, they form a strong joint. Hence, gas welding is a fusion welding process as well.

(C) Resistance welding:
Resistance welding is a non-fusion welding process that uses heat generated by electrical resistance to join metal materials. In this process, a current is passed through the metal parts while they are clamped together, causing the metals to heat up due to their combined electrical resistance. Once sufficiently heated, the metal materials begin to soften and meld together, forming a bond. Since the metals don't reach their melting points in this process, resistance welding is NOT a fusion welding process.

(D) Friction stir welding:
Friction stir welding is a solid-state welding process that involves the use of a spinning tool that is inserted into the joint between two metal materials. The relative motion of the tool and workpiece generates friction, causing the materials to heat up and soften. The softened material is then mixed and bonded by the stirring action of the tool, forming a strong joint without melting the base material. Thus, friction stir welding is not a fusion welding process.

In conclusion, the correct answer is (C) Resistance welding, as it is NOT a fusion welding process.
