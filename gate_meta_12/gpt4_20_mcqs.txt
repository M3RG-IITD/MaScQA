To find the correct combination of Burgers vectors for the two partial dislocations, we need to find two vectors that add up to the given unit dislocation Burgers vector (a/2)[1 -1 0]:

Let the two partial dislocations have Burgers vectors b1 and b2. We need to have b1 + b2 = (a/2)[1 -1 0].
We can test each combination given in the options:

A) (a/6)[2 -1 1] + (a/6)[1 -2 -1] = (a/6)[1 1 0]
B) (a/6)[1 -1 2] + (a/6)[-1 -2 1] = (a/6)[0 -3 3]
C) (a/6)[1 1 -2] + (a/6)[2 -1 -1] = (a/2)[1 -1 0]
D) (a/6)[2 1 1] + (a/6)[1 2 -1] = (a/6)[3 3 0]

Only option C gives the correct combination of Burgers vectors that add up to the given unit dislocation Burgers vector. So the answer is:

[(a/6)[1 1 -2], (a/6)[2 -1 -1]]
