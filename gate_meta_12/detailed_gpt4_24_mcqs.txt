In the casting process, a riser, also known as a feeder, is used to feed molten metal to the casting to compensate for any shrinkage that occurs as the metal solidifies. The shrinkage can lead to defects, such as cavities or voids, in the cast product. Therefore, the riser is designed to ensure a continuous supply of molten metal to the casting until it is completely solidified.

Now, let's analyze the given options:

(A) Before casting solidifies: If the melt in the riser solidifies before the casting solidifies, it will not be able to provide the required molten metal to the casting. As a result, the casting may develop defects such as shrinkage cavities.

(B) At the same time as casting solidifies: If the riser solidifies at the same time as the casting, it may not be able to completely compensate for the shrinkage in the casting. There is still a possibility that some parts of the casting may not receive enough molten metal, leading to defects.

(C) After casting solidifies: If the melt in the riser solidifies after the casting solidifies, it means that the riser is still able to provide the molten metal to the casting as it solidifies. This ensures that the casting does not have any voids or cavities due to shrinkage, resulting in a better-quality cast product.

(D) Irrespective of the solidification of the casting: This option implies that the riser's solidification doesn't affect the casting. However, this is not correct, as the purpose of the riser is to supply molten metal during the solidification process, so the solidification of the riser is directly related to the casting's solidification.

So, the correct answer is:

(C) After casting solidifies
