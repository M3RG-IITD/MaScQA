The problem can be modeled using the one-dimensional diffusion equation:

$$\frac{\partial c_B}{\partial t} = D\frac{\partial^2 c_B}{\partial x^2}$$

with initial and boundary conditions:

$$c_B(x,0) = \frac{m}{\pi R^2}e^{-x^2/R^2}$$

$$c_B(0,t) = c_B(L,t)$$

where $R$ is the radius of the rods and $L$ is their length. The initial condition assumes that the plated layer is uniformly distributed on the end faces of the rods.

Taking the Laplace transform of both sides of the diffusion equation with respect to time, we get:

$$sC_B(x,s) - \frac{m}{\pi R^2}e^{-x^2/R^2} = D\frac{\partial^2 C_B(x,s)}{\partial x^2}$$

Solving for $C_B(x,s)$, we get:

$$C_B(x,s) = \frac{m}{\pi R^2 s}\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+4D/sR^2}}e^{-x^2/(1+4D/sR^2)R^2}$$

Taking the inverse Laplace transform of $C_B(x,s)$ with respect to $s$ using the convolution theorem, we get:

$$c_B(x,t) = \frac{m}{2\sqrt{\pi D t}}\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+4Dt/R^2}}e^{-x^2/(4Dt/R^2+1)}\text{erf}\left(\frac{x}{2\sqrt{Dt/R^2+1}}\right)$$

where erf is the error function. Since the rods are identical, $c_B(0,t) = c_B(L,t)$, which simplifies the expression to:

$$c_B(x,t) = \frac{m}{2\sqrt{\pi D t}}e^{-x^2/(4Dt/R^2+1)}\text{erf}\left(\frac{x}{2\sqrt{Dt/R^2+1}}\right)$$

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) $c_B$ = (m/2$(Ï€*D*t)^(0.5)$) * erf[-$x^(2)$/4*D*t].
