First we need to find the mole fractions of each component. To do this, we'll first find the molecular weights of each component and then convert the given wt% to mole fractions.

Molecular weight of CaO = Ca + O = 40 + 16 = 56
Molecular weight of SiO2 = Si + 2O = 28 + 2*16 = 60
Molecular weight of Al2O3 = 2Al + 3O = 2*27 + 3*16 = 54 + 48 = 102
Molecular weight of MgO = Mg + O = 24 + 16 = 40

Now, let's find the amount of each component in 100g of liquid slag:
55 wt.% of CaO = 55 g
20 wt.% of SiO2 = 20 g
15 wt.% of Al2O3 = 15 g
10 wt.% of MgO = 10 g

Now we'll find the moles of each component:
moles of CaO = 55 g / 56 g/mol = 0.982 moles
moles of SiO2 = 20 g / 60 g/mol = 0.333 moles
moles of Al2O3 = 15 g / 102 g/mol = 0.147 moles
moles of MgO = 10 g / 40 g/mol = 0.250 moles

Now, let's find the total moles:
Total moles = 0.982 + 0.333 + 0.147 + 0.250 = 1.712

Now we can find the mole fractions of each component:

X_CaO = 0.982 / 1.712 = 0.573
X_SiO2 = 0.333 / 1.712 = 0.194
X_Al2O3 = 0.147 / 1.712 = 0.086
X_MgO = 0.250 / 1.712 = 0.146

Now, we can plug these mole fractions into the given equation for log C_s:

log C_s = 3.44 * (0.573 + 0.1*0.146 - 0.8*0.086 - 0.194) - (9894 / 1900) + 2.05

Calculate the expression inside the brackets:

= 3.44 * (0.573 + 0.0146 - 0.0688 - 0.194)
= 3.44 * (0.3248)

Now find the value of log C_s:
log C_s = 3.44 * 0.3248 - (9894 / 1900) + 2.05
log C_s = 1.1164 - 5.209 + 2.05
log C_s = -2.0426

Now to find C_s, we take the inverse logarithm (antilogarithm) of log C_s:
C_s = 10^(-2.0426) â‰ˆ 0.009

So, the correct answer is (B) 0.009.
