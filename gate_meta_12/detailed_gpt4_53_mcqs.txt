We are given the following:

Grain size = ASTM No. 6
Lattice frictional stress = 100 MN/$m^2$ or 100,000 MPa
Hall-Petch constant (k) = 0.10 MN/$m^(1.5)$ or 100 N/$m^(1.5)$

In order to find the yield strength of the material, we need to use the Hall-Petch equation:

Yield strength = Lattice frictional stress + k * d^(-1/2)

where 'd' is the grain diameter. 

First, let's find the grain diameter 'd' from the given ASTM grain size number, which is 6.

The ASTM grain size number (G) can be determined using the following equation:

G = -6.6 + 14.1 x log(d)

We want to solve for d:

d = 10^((G + 6.6) / 14.1)

Substitute G = 6:

d = 10^((6 + 6.6) / 14.1)
d ≈ 10^(0.892)
d ≈ 7.816 µm

Now that we have the grain diameter, we can find the yield strength using the Hall-Petch equation:

Yield strength = 100,000 MPa + 100 N/$m^(1.5)$ * (7.816 * 10^(-6) m)^(-1/2)

Converting N/m^(1.5) to MPa/m^(1.5):

100 N/$m^(1.5)$ = (100 * 10^(-6)) / (10^(-9))^(1.5) = 0.1 MPa/$m^(1.5)$

Plugging the values into the equation:

Yield strength = 100,000 MPa + 0.1 MPa/$m^(1.5)$ * (7.816 * 10^(-6) m)^(-1/2)
Yield strength = 100,000 MPa + (0.1 MPa/$m^(1.5)$ * (1.277 * 10^(5) $m^(1.5)$))
Yield strength ≈ 100,000 MPa + 15 MPa
Yield strength ≈ 115,000 MPa or 115 MPa

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 115 MPa. 

To summarize:

1. Convert the given ASTM grain size number to grain diameter.
2. Use the Hall-Petch equation to find the yield strength by plugging in the values for lattice frictional stress, Hall-Petch constant, and grain diameter.
3. The yield strength is approximately 115 MPa.

Answer: [115 MPa]
