Group I is related to corrosion principles: 

P. Electrode Polarization - It is a phenomenon in which an electrode in a potential is further charged or discharged by the application of an external voltage.  Electrode polarization mainly takes place in the electrochemical cells and can affect the rate of electrochemical reactions.

Q. Passivity - It is a phenomenon in which a metal surface becomes passive, i.e., it gets chemically inactive due to the formation of a thin oxide layer (normally stable) over the surface.

R. Selective leaching - It is a form of corrosion in which one constituent (more reactive) from a homogenous alloy gets preferentially leached, leaving behind a weakened and corroded structure.

S. Grain boundary precipitation - It is a process in which a secondary phase starts forming along the grain boundaries, thus altering the grain boundary properties like cohesion, strength, etc.

Group II is related to corrosion terminologies:

1. Dezincification - It is a form of selective leaching corrosion in which zinc gets leached out of a brass alloy, leaving behind a weak, porous, and corroded structure.

2. Intergranular attack - It is a form of selective leaching corrosion in which the grain boundaries are weakened, and the metallic structure starts getting dissolved and corroded.

3. Overvoltage - It is a phenomenon in which an electrode potential is raised beyond its normal range due to the use of high current density or high current flow, causing higher corrosive reactions.

4. Surface oxide film - It is an oxide layer that formed over the metal surface by reacting under a given environment, which helps in preventing further corrosion.

Therefore, the matching of principles in Group I with corresponding corrosion terminology in Group II is as follows:

P-3, Q-4, R-1, S-2

Hence, the correct answer is option (A).
