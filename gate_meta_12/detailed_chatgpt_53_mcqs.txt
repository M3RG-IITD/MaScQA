Given data:

Grain size, d = ASTM No. 6
Lattice frictional stress, τ = 100 MN/$m^2$
Locking parameter (Hall-Petch constant), k = 0.10 MN/$m^{1.5}$

The Hall-Petch relationship is given by σ_y = σ_o + k_d^(-1/2), where
σ_y = yield strength
σ_o = frictional stress (intercept of Hall-Petch plot)
d = grain size

From the given data, we can calculate the frictional stress as:

σ_o = τ = 100 MN/$m^2$

To calculate the yield strength, we need to calculate the grain size in meters:

From the table of ASTM grain sizes:
ASTM no. 6 = 3.35 mm

Converting to meters:
d = 3.35 x 10^(-3) m

Substituting these values in the Hall-Petch equation:

σ_y = 100 + 0.10 x (3.35 x 10^(-3))^(-1/2)
σ_y = 100 + 163.8
σ_y = 263.8 MN/$m^2$ = 263.8 MPa

Therefore, the approximate yield strength of the material is 263.8 MPa.

Answer: 
- 263.8 MPa (rounded to one decimal place)
