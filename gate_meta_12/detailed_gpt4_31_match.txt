First, we should understand the meaning of each term:

Group I:

P. Electrode polarization: The reaction at an electrode causing the potential to deviate from equilibrium values.

Q. Passivity: The property of some metals to resist further corrosion when exposed to a corrosive environment by the formation of a thin surface oxide film.

R. Selective leaching: The removal of one element from an alloy by a corrosive environment, leaving behind a weakened and porous structure.

S. Grain boundary precipitation: The occurrence of impurities or secondary phases along the boundaries of the crystalline grains in a material, causing weakened mechanical properties and susceptibility to intergranular attack.

Group II:

1. Dezincification: A type of selective leaching in which zinc is removed from brass, leaving behind a weakened copper-rich structure.

2. Intergranular attack: Corrosion that occurs along the grain boundaries of a metal, often as a result of grain boundary precipitation.

3. Over voltage: The amount of voltage required to drive an electrochemical reaction beyond the equilibrium potential, such as electrolysis or electrode polarization.

4. Surface oxide film: A thin layer of oxide that forms on the surface of some metals when exposed to the environment, resulting in passivation and increased corrosion resistance.

Now, we can match the terms from Group I to Group II:

P. Electrode polarization → 3. Over voltage (both terms refer to deviation from equilibrium potentials)

Q. Passivity → 4. Surface oxide film (passivity arises due to the formation of a protective oxide film)

R. Selective leaching → 1. Dezincification (dezincification is a specific example of selective leaching)

S. Grain boundary precipitation → 2. Intergranular attack (grain boundary precipitation leads to susceptibility to intergranular attack)

So, the correct option is (A) P-3, Q-4, R-1, S-2.
