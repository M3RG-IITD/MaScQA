We are given that a steel ball is placed in an upward moving liquid aluminum. To find the terminal velocity of a fine spherical steel particle having a diameter $d_p$ in the quiescent liquid Al bath, we can use the formula for terminal velocity of a sphere falling through a fluid:

$v_t = \frac{2}{9} \frac{(\rho_{steel} - \rho_{Al})}{\mu_{Al}} g R^2$

where $v_t$ is the terminal velocity, $\rho_{steel}$ is the density of steel, $\rho_{Al}$ is the density of liquid Al, $\mu_{Al}$ is the viscosity of liquid Al, $g$ is the gravitational acceleration (9.81 m/$s^2$), and $R$ is the radius of the steel ball.

We are given that $\rho_{steel}$ = 7200 kg/m³, $\rho_{Al}$ = 2360 kg/m³, and $\mu_{Al}$ = 1*$10^{–3}$ Pa.s.

Now, we need to find the radius of the steel ball in terms of its diameter. We know that $R = d_p / 2$, so $R^2 = (d_p / 2)^2 = d_p^2 / 4$.

Substituting the values of density, viscosity, and radius into the formula for terminal velocity, we get:

$v_t = \frac{2}{9} \frac{(7200 - 2360)}{1*10^{-3}} (9.81) \frac{d_p^2}{4}$
$v_t = \frac{2}{9} (4840) (9.81) \frac{d_p^2}{4*10^{-6}}$
$v_t = 2.6*10^6 d_p^2$ m/s

Hence, the terminal velocity of a fine spherical steel particle having diameter $d_p$ in µm range, if allowed to fall in a quiescent liquid Al bath, is 2.6* $10^6$ $d_(p)^2$ m/s, which corresponds to option (B).

So the correct answer is [2.6* $10^6$ $d_(p)^2$ m/s].
