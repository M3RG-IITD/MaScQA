When a metal is quenched, it is rapidly cooled to harden it. The severity of quenching depends on the cooling rate. The faster the cooling rate, the more severe the quench. 

The increasing severity of quenching for the given options can be arranged as follows: 

- Oil quenching (P): relatively slow cooling rate
- Water quenching with agitation (R): faster cooling rate than oil quenching due to agitation
- Water quenching (Q): faster cooling rate than oil quenching
- Brine quenching (S): fastest cooling rate among the given options

Therefore, the correct order of increasing severity of quenching is (A) P<Q<R<S.
