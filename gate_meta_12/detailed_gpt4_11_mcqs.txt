To determine which of the given elements can reduce copper from acidic copper sulfate solution, we need to consider the reactivity of the elements in comparison to copper. This can be done by observing their positions in the reactivity series of metals, also known as the electrochemical series.

The reactivity series lists metals in the order of their reactivity with the most reactive at the top and the least reactive at the bottom. In general, a more reactive metal can displace a less reactive metal from its salt solution.

Here is a portion of the reactivity series, where the elements relevant to this question have been highlighted:

1. Potassium (K)
2. Sodium (Na)
3. Calcium (Ca)
4. Magnesium (Mg)
5. Aluminum (Al)
6. **Carbon (C)**
7. Zinc (Zn)
8. **Iron (Fe)**
9. **Lead (Pb)**
10. **Silver (Ag)**
11. Copper (Cu)

Now, let's analyze each option:

(A) Silver (Ag): Looking at the reactivity series, silver is less reactive than copper. Therefore, silver cannot displace copper from its salt solution. So, this option is incorrect.

(B) Iron (Fe): Iron is more reactive than copper in the reactivity series. Thus, iron can displace copper from its salt solution. So, this option is correct.

(C) Carbon (C): In the reactivity series, carbon is more reactive than copper. Therefore, carbon can displace copper from its salt solution. However, it should be noted that the process may be slow and require high temperatures. So, this option is partially correct.

(D) Lead (Pb): According to the reactivity series, lead is less reactive than copper. Hence, lead cannot displace copper from its salt solution. So, this option is incorrect.

Based on our analysis, iron (Fe) is able to reduce copper from the acidic copper sulfate solution. Carbon (C) can also do this, but the process may be slower and require high temperatures. Therefore, the correct answer inside a list is:

[B, C]
