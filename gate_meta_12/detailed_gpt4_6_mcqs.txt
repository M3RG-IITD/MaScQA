Step 1: Identify the reactants

In this case, the reactants are zinc metal (Zn) and hydrochloric acid (HCl).

Step 2: Write the balanced chemical equation

The balanced chemical equation for the reaction between zinc and hydrochloric acid is:

Zn (s) + 2HCl (aq) → ZnCl₂ (aq) + H₂ (g)

Step 3: Analyze the products

According to the balanced chemical equation, the products of the reaction are zinc chloride (ZnCl₂) and hydrogen gas (H₂).

Step 4: Identify the correct option based on the products

As we can see, hydrogen gas (H₂) is evolved during the reaction. Therefore, the correct option is:

(A) Evolution of hydrogen

So, the correct answer is [A].
