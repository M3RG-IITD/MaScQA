The correct equation for the angle of contact (θ) is:

θ = $cos^{-1}$[(γαδ - γβδ)/γαβ]

where γαδ is the surface tension between air and substrate, γβδ is the surface tension between droplet and substrate, and γαβ is the surface tension between air and droplet.

Step-by-step explanation:

1. Identify the surface tensions: 

γαδ is the surface tension between air and substrate, which is the horizontal line in the figure labeled as δ. 

γβδ is the surface tension between droplet and substrate, which is the vertical line in the figure labeled as β. 

γαβ is the surface tension between air and droplet, which is the curved surface of the droplet labeled as βα. 

2. Plug in the values: 

θ = $cos^{-1}$[(γαδ - γβδ)/γαβ]

θ = $cos^{-1}$[(20 mN/m - 30 mN/m)/50 mN/m]

θ = $cos^{-1}$[-0.2]

3. Solve for θ: 

Using a calculator, we find that the angle of contact is approximately 103.13 degrees. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) θ = $cos^(-1)$[$γ_(αδ)$ - $γ_(βδ)$/$γ_(αβ)$].
