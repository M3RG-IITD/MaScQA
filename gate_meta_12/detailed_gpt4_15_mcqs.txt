To solve this problem, we first need to understand some concepts in X-ray diffraction and the relationship between the diffraction angle, lattice parameter, and diffraction conditions.

X-ray diffraction relies on the Bragg's law, which states that for a constructive interference (peak) to be observed, the following condition must be met:

nλ = 2d * sin(θ)

where n is the order of the diffraction, λ is the wavelength of the incident beam, d is the interplanar distance between lattice planes, and θ is the diffraction angle.

In this problem, we have:

2θ = 78°
θ = 78°/2 = 39°
λ = 0.154 nm 
n = 1 (we will assume the first order diffraction)

For a face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice, the interplanar distance (d) can be expressed as a function of the lattice parameter (a) and the Miller indices (h, k, and l):

d = a / √(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)

For the {311} planes:

h = 3
k = 1
l = 1

So, d = a / √(3^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) = a / √(9+1+1) = a / √11

Now, let's use Bragg's law to find the value of a:

nλ = 2d * sin(θ)
1 * 0.154 nm = 2 * (a / √11) * sin(39°)

Next, solve for the lattice parameter, a:

0.154 nm = 2 * (a / √11) * sin(39°)
0.154 nm = (2a / √11) * 0.629
a = (0.154 nm * √11) / (2 * 0.629)
a ≈ 0.361 nm

The lattice parameter is approximately 0.361 nm. Looking at the given options, this is closest to 0.4 nm.

So, the correct answer is:

(B) 0.4 nm
