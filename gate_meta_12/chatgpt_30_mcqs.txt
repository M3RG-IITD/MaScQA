The situation described in the question is an example of one-dimensional diffusion with symmetry. The correct equation to describe the composition profile $c_B$ along the rod axis x after time t is:

$c_B = \frac{m}{2\sqrt{\pi D t}} \exp \left(\frac{-x^2}{4Dt} \right)$

where D is the diffusion coefficient of B in A.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) $c_B$ = (m/2$(Ï€*D*t)^(0.5)$) * exp[-$x^(2)$/4*D*t].
