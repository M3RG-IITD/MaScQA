The Burgers vector of the partial dislocations formed by the splitting of a unit dislocation should add up to the Burgers vector of the unit dislocation. 

Given: Burgers vector of the unit dislocation = (a/2)[1 -1 0]

We need to find two partial dislocations such that their burgers vectors add up to the burgers vector of the unit dislocation.

Let's take one of the partial dislocation's Burgers vector to be (m/n)[u v w]. Then the Burgers vector of the other partial dislocation should be (1-m/n)[u v w]. 

So, if (m/n)[u v w] and (1-m/n)[u v w] are the Burgers vectors of the two partial dislocations formed by splitting the unit dislocation, then the Burgers vector of the unit dislocation can be written as:

Burgers vector of unit dislocation = (m/n)[u v w] + (1-m/n)[u v w]

Simplifying this equation, we get:

Burgers vector of unit dislocation = [u v w]

So, we need to find two integers m and n, such that m/n is a fraction and (m/n)[u v w] and (1-m/n)[u v w] add up to [u v w]. 

One way to find such integers m and n is to use the formula for continued fractions. We can represent m/n as a continued fraction [a0; a1, a2, a3, ...]. If we truncate this continued fraction after the nth term, we get an approximation of m/n with an error that is (a0; a1, a2, ..., an-1).

Using this method, we can find that (a/2)[1 -1 0] can be split into two partial dislocations with burgers vectors:

(m/n)[u v w] = (a/6)[2 -1 1] and (1-m/n)[u v w] = (a/6)[1 -2 -1]

To verify that these partial dislocations add up to the unit dislocation, we can add them up:

(m/n)[u v w] + (1-m/n)[u v w] = [u v w]

(a/6)[2 -1 1] + (a/6)[1 -2 -1] = (a/2)[1 -1 0]

This shows that the answer is option (A) (a/6)[2 -1 1] and (a/6)[1 -2 -1].
