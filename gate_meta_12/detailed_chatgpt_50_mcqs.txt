To calculate the stress ratio, we need to look at the formula for stress ratio:

Stress ratio (R) = (maximum stress)/(minimum stress)

Looking at the image provided, we can see that the maximum stress is at point A and is equal to -80MPa, while the minimum stress is at point B and is equal to -20MPa.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

R = -80MPa/-20MPa

R = 4

Therefore, the stress ratio is 4.

Answer: (A) 4
