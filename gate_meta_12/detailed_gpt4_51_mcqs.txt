Unfortunately, I cannot see the image you are referencing. However, here is a general explanation of how to determine the amplitude ratio using an equation.

The amplitude ratio can be defined as the ratio of two amplitudes (A1 and A2) within a wave or oscillation system. For example, the amplitude ratio can be represented as:

Amplitude Ratio = A1 / A2

To find the value of the amplitude ratio, you would need to have the values of A1 and A2, which may be given or can be determined from the graphs or equations of the waves or oscillations in question.

Here are some general steps for determining the amplitude ratio for different types of oscillations:

1. Identify the values of A1 and A2.
2. Divide the amplitude of the first oscillation (A1) by the amplitude of the second oscillation (A2).
3. Simplify if possible.
4. Check the available options for the correct answer.

In the problem you have shared, the options provided are (A) 3, (B) 1/3, (C) -1/3, and (D) -3. Once you have found the values of A1 and A2 using the given image or equations, you can follow the steps above to determine the amplitude ratio and pick the correct answer.
