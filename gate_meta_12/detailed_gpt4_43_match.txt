To solve this question, let's first understand the phenomena in Group I and their corresponding mechanisms in Group II.

Group I:

P. Fatigue: The weakening of a material caused by repeated loading and unloading cycles.

Q. Creep: The slow deformation of a material over time when subjected to a constant stress, usually at high temperatures.

R. Strain hardening: An increase in the strength and hardness of a material due to plastic deformation, such as bending or stretching.

S. Yield point phenomenon: The point in a stress-strain curve where a material begins to exhibit plastic deformation (i.e., it begins to permanently deform).

Group II:

1. Grain boundary sliding: A process where the grains in a material slide past each other, usually at high temperatures, without significant plastic deformation. Typically associated with creep.

2. Slip band extrusion and intrusion: The formation of extrusions (raised areas) and intrusions (depressed areas) on the surface of a material due to dislocation motion. This process can cause surface roughening and is typically associated with fatigue.

3. Cottrell atmosphere: The interaction of dislocations with impurity atoms in a material, forming a region of stress around the dislocation. This can lead to a decrease in dislocation mobility and is typically associated with the yield point phenomenon.

4. Dislocation interaction: The interaction of dislocations with each other or with other obstacles in the material, which can lead to an increase in the material's strength and hardening. This is typically associated with strain hardening.

Now, match the Group I phenomena to the Group II mechanisms:

P. Fatigue is associated with slip band extrusion and intrusion (2).

Q. Creep is associated with grain boundary sliding (1).

R. Strain hardening is associated with dislocation interaction (4).

S. Yield point phenomenon is associated with the Cottrell atmosphere (3).

Therefore, the correct option is (C) P-2, Q-1, R-4, S-3.
