A steel ball (density $ρ_(steel)$ = 7200 kg/$m^(3)$) is placed in an upward moving liquid Al (density $ρ_(Al)$ = 2360 kg/$m^(3)$, viscosity $μ_(Al)$ = 1*$10^(–3)$ Pa.s and Reynolds number = 5*$10^(5)$). The force (F) exerted on the steel ball is expressed as: F = f π $R^(2)$ ($ρ_(Al)$ $v^2$ /2) where, f is friction factor (=0.2), v is the velocity of liquid Al and R is the radius of steel ball. The terminal velocity of a fine spherical steel particle having diameter $d_p$, in µm range, if allowed to fall in a quiescent liquid Al bath, is
(A) 5.2*$10^6$ $d_(p)^2$ m/s (B) 2.6* $10^6$ $d_(p)^2$ m/s (C) 1.3*$10^6$ $d_(p)^2$ m/s (D) 6.6* $10^5$ $d_(p)^2$ m/s
