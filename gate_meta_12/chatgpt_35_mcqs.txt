The equilibrium constant (K) can be calculated from the standard Gibbs energy change (∆G°) using the following equation:

∆G° = -RT ln K

where R is the gas constant and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

At 1173K, ∆G°= 8120 J, which we need to convert to Joules/mole:

∆G°/n = -RT ln K

8120J/mol=(-8.314J/mol*K)(1173K) ln K

ln K = -8120 J/mol / (-8.314 J/molK * 1173K) = 0.788

K = e^(0.788) = 2.20

The equilibrium constant (K) for this reaction is 2.20. The equilibrium constant expression for the reaction is:

K = ([Fe][CO]/[FeO][CO2])

At equilibrium, we can express the reaction quotient (Q) as:

Q = ([Fe][CO]/[FeO][CO2]) = p(CO)/p(CO2)

where p(CO) and p(CO2) are the partial pressures of CO and CO2, respectively.

Therefore, the ratio of p(CO)/p(CO2) at equilibrium is equal to the equilibrium constant K, which is 2.20.
