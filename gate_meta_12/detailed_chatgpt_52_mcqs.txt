Given:
ASTM grain size number = 6
Lattice frictional stress = 100 MN/$m^2$
Hall-Petch constant = 0.10 MN/$m^(1.5)$

We know that the Hall-Petch equation is given by:
$\sigma = \sigma_0 + k_yd^{-1/2}$ 
where 
$\sigma_0$ is the frictional stress when the grain size is infinite
$k_y$ is the Hall-Petch constant
$d$ is the grain size
$\sigma$ is the frictional stress with the given grain size

ASTM grain size numbers are defined such that $d=2^{-(n-1)/4}\mu m$
where n is the ASTM grain size number.

Putting the given values in the Hall-Petch equation, we get:
$100 = \sigma_0 + 0.10d^{-1/2}$ 

To find $\sigma_0$, we can use the fact that the frictional stress when the grain size is infinite should be equal to the lattice frictional stress. Therefore,
$\sigma_0 = 100$ MN/$m^2$

Substituting this value, we get:
$100 = 100 + 0.10d^{-1/2}$ 

Simplifying, we get:
$0.10 = 0.10d^{-1/2}$ 

Solving for $d$, we get:
$d = (0.10/0.10)^2$ $= 1$ $µm^2$

But this is the grain size in square micrometers. To get the grain size in micrometers, we need to take the square root:
$d = 1$ $µm$

Finally, we can use the equation relating ASTM grain size number and grain size in micrometers to get the ASTM grain size number:

$d = 2^{-(n-1)/4}\mu m$

$1 = 2^{-(n-1)/4}\mu m$

Taking the logarithm (base 2) of both sides, we get:
$0 = -(n-1)/4$ 

Simplifying, we get:
$n - 1 = 0$ 

Therefore:
$n = 1$

This corresponds to ASTM grain size number 1, which is not listed in the answer choices. However, we should note that the Hall-Petch equation may not be valid for very small grain sizes (less than about 10 nm), so the answer may actually be C (4.5 µm) or D (3.5 µm) if we assume that the Hall-Petch equation is only valid in the range of grain sizes for which it has been experimentally verified.
