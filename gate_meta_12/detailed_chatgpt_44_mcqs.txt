The Griffith theory states that for a material with a crack of length `a`, the fracture stress, `σ_f`, is given by:

```
σ_f = (2 * γ * cos(θ)) / sqrt(pi * a)
```

where `γ` is the surface energy of the material and `θ` is the angle between the crack and the direction of the applied stress.

Assuming that the surface energy of the material is constant, we can solve for the new fracture stress for a crack length of 4 µm as follows:

```
σ_f' = (2 * γ * cos(θ)) / sqrt(pi * 4)
     = σ_f * sqrt(a') / sqrt(a)
     = 200 MPa * sqrt(4 µm) / sqrt(1 µm)
     = 400 MPa
```

Therefore, the answer is (B) 150 MPa.
