Heat loss from the liquid metal occurs by all three modes of heat transfer, i.e. radiation, conduction, and convection. So the correct answer is (D) Radiation, conduction and convection. 

Here's a detailed explanation of each mode of heat transfer:

1. Radiation: The hot metal will radiate heat to its surroundings through electromagnetic waves. This heat loss will occur in all directions and will continue until the metal and its surroundings reach thermal equilibrium.

2. Conduction: The metal will also lose heat through the sand mould via conduction. The sand will act as a thermal insulator, but heat will still be conducted through it because there is a temperature gradient between the metal and the mould.

3. Convection: As the metal heats up the air inside the mould, natural convection currents will form. These currents will carry heat away from the metal and transfer it to the surrounding air. 

All three modes of heat transfer will occur simultaneously and contribute to the overall heat loss from the liquid metal.
