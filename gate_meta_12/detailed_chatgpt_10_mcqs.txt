Floatation beneficiation is based on the principle of mineral surface hydrophobicity.

Explanation:

Flotation beneficiation is a process of separating valuable minerals from gangue minerals by selectively attaching hydrophobic particles to air bubbles in a small amount of reagent solution and then floating the mineralized bubbles to the surface of the pulp to be scraped off as foam products. Hydrophobicity is a physical characteristic of some minerals that repel water molecules and preferentially adsorb on air bubbles. The hydrophobicity of minerals depends on their surface properties, such as surface charge, surface energy, and surface species. By controlling the pH, collector, frother, and other process parameters, the selective flotation of hydrophobic minerals can be achieved.

Gravity difference beneficiation, also known as gravity concentration, is a process of sorting minerals based on their density difference using gravity, centrifugal force, or water flow. It is suitable for coarse and medium-grained ore materials with a wide density range.

Chemical reactivity beneficiation is a process of altering the chemical composition of minerals by chemical or biochemical methods, such as leaching, roasting, bio-oxidation, and bioleaching. It is suitable for refractory or complex ore materials that cannot be processed by physical methods alone.

Particle size difference beneficiation is a process of separating minerals based on their particle size using sieves, screens, classifiers, hydrocyclones, or settling tanks. It is suitable for fine-grained ore materials with a narrow size range.
