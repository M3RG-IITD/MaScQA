An alloy of overall composition $X_B$ =0.7 was equilibrated at temperature $T_1$. Microstructural analysis showed two phases, α and β, and that the phase fraction of β was 0.75. Given that the equilibrium composition of β at $T_1$ is 0.9 as shown in the phase diagram below, the maximum solubility of B in α (in mole fraction) at this temperature is?
