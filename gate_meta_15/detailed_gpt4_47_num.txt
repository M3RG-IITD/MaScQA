1. First, we need to find the total amount of heat required to solidify a certain mass of liquid metal. To do this, we'll use the latent heat of fusion formula:

   Q = mL
   
   Where Q is the heat required, m is the mass, and L is the latent heat of fusion.

2. Next, we need to find the mass fraction of solid at the mould exit. The mass fraction is defined as the ratio of the mass of the solid to the total mass. To find this, we'll use the following formula:

   Mass fraction = Mass of solid / Total mass

3. Now, let's set up the equations:

   Q = mL
   Q = (Mass of solid) * L

   Mass fraction = (Mass of solid) / (Total mass)

4. We are given that the total rate of heat removal by the mould is 4.2 × $10^6$ W, which means 4.2 × $10^6$ J/sec. Since the metal exits the mould at a rate of 35 kg $s^(-1)$, we can calculate the total heat removal per mass:

   Heat per mass = (4.2 × $10^6$ J/s) / (35 kg/s)
   Heat per mass = 120000 J/kg

5. Now, let's use the latent heat formula to find the mass of solid:

   Q = mL
   120000 J/kg = (Mass of solid) * (3 × $10^5$ J/kg)

   Mass of solid = 120000 J/kg / (3 × $10^5$ J/kg)
   Mass of solid = 0.4 kg

6. Finally, let's find the mass fraction of the solid at the mould exit:

   Mass fraction = (Mass of solid) / (Total mass)
   Mass fraction = 0.4 kg / 35 kg
   Mass fraction = 0.01143

The mass fraction of solid at the mould exit is approximately 0.01143 or 1.143%.

Therefore, the correct answer is [0.01143].
