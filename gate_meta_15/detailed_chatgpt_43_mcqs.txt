Step 1: Analyze the TTT diagram given.

TTT diagram shows the transformation of austenite to different phases at different temperatures for a particular cooling rate. In the given diagram, we have eutectoid steel (0.8% carbon).

The four heat treatments for eutectoid steel are:
P - Austenitization (heating to 720°C) and holding for 1 hour, followed by slow cooling to 650°C and holding for 10 hours
Q - Austenitization (heating to 800°C) and quenching in oil
R - Austenitization (heating to 760°C) and isothermal cooling to 350°C
S - Austenitization (heating to 760°C) and isothermal cooling to 540°C

Step 2: Identify the resulting microstructures for each heat treatment.

P: Cooling from austenite temperature to 650°C at a slow rate and holding for 10 hours leads to the formation of fine pearlite.

Q: Quenching austenite at 800°C results in the formation of martensite.

R: Isothermal cooling from austenite temperature to 350°C results in the formation of bainite.

S: Isothermal cooling from austenite temperature to 540°C results in the formation of coarse pearlite.

Step 3: Match the heat treatments with the resulting microstructures.

P-1, Q-2, R-3, S-4

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) P-1, Q-2, R-3, S-4.
