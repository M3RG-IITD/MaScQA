The correct match between the scientist pairs in Group I and the phenomena in Group II is: P - Hall-Petch: Grain boundary strengthening (4), Q - Nabarro-Herring: Diffusional creep (2), R - Lomer-Cottrell: Dislocation reaction product (1), S - Frank-Read: Dislocation source (3).

So, the correct answer is: [(C) P-4, Q-2, R-1, S-3]
