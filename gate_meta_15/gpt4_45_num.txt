To solve this problem, we can use the principle of volume conservation. The volume of the billet before and after forging will remain the same.

The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula V = πr²h, where V is the volume, r is the radius, and h is the height.

For the initial billet:
Height (h1) = 1.0 m
Diameter (d1) = 0.5 m
Radius (r1) = d1/2 = 0.25 m

For the forged pancake:
Height (h2) = 0.25 m
Diameter (d2) = ? (we need to find this)
Radius (r2) = d2/2

Now we can equate the volumes:

V1 = V2
πr1²h1 = πr2²h2
π(0.25²)1 = π(r2²)(0.25)

Cancel out the π and divide by 0.25:

r1² = r2²
(0.25²) = r2²

Now square root both sides:

r2 = sqrt(0.25²) = 0.5

Now find the diameter: 
d2 = 2 * r2 = 2 * 0.5 = 1.0

The diameter of the pancake is 1.0 m.
