Let us match the features observed in castings one by one by analyzing them.

P. Macrosegregation - This phenomenon occurs when there is a non-uniform distribution of alloying elements or impurities in the casting. It generally happens due to density differences and convection currents that result in the movement of lighter (or less dense) components of the alloy toward the top and sinking of heavier components. Therefore, P matches with 4.

Q. Fine-grained structure - Fine-grained structures in castings are desired as they generally provide better mechanical properties compared to coarse-grained structures. This fine-grained structure is usually achieved through inoculation, a process that introduces small solid particles (usually a finer and chemically modified form of the base metal) to the melt, resulting in the formation of nucleation sites for the solidification process. Therefore, Q matches with 1.

R. Porosity - Porosity occurs in castings primarily because of trapped gases and shrinkage upon solidification. These cavities can be evolved from trapped gases or produced by volume reduction due to the casting's contraction during solidification. Therefore, R matches with 2.

S. Dendrites - Dendrites are tree-like structures that form during solidification in castings. They form when temperature gradients occur during the solidification process, leading to the formation of supercooled zones in the melt. In these zones, solidification starts with the formation of dendrites growing directionally opposite to the heat removal direction. Therefore, S matches with 3.

So, the correct matches are: P-4, Q-1, R-2, and S-3.

Thus, the correct answer is (B): [P-4, Q-1, R-2, S-3].
