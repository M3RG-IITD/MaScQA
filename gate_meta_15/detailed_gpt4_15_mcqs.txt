In an X-ray powder diffraction pattern, the peaks represent planes in the crystal lattice that give constructive interference with the X-Ray, thus corresponding to Bragg's law:

nλ = 2d * sinθ

where n is the order of reflection, λ is the wavelength of the X-Ray, d is the interplanar spacing, and θ is the Bragg angle.

For a cubic crystal, the lattice parameter (the distance between neighboring atoms) is denoted as "a." For a simple cubic crystal, which has atoms only on the corner of the unit cell, the Miller indices (h, k, l) can be used to calculate the interplanar spacing d_hkl using the following formula:

d_hkl = a / √(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)

Now, in an X-ray powder pattern, the peaks are usually arranged in increasing order of the angle, or equivalently, in decreasing order of interplanar spacing d. We have already found the first peak, which is related to the (100) plane. Now, let's evaluate the interplanar spacings for the remaining given planes and find the second smallest d value.

(A) (111) plane: d_111 = a / √(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) = a / √3
(B) (100) plane: d_100 = a / √(1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2) = a
(C) (200) plane: d_200 = a / √(2^2 + 0^2 + 0^2) = a / 2
(D) (110) plane: d_110 = a / √(1^2 + 1^2 + 0^2) = a / √2

Now, we will compare these values in decreasing order of d:

1) d_100 = a
2) d_110 = a / √2
3) d_200 = a / 2
4) d_111 = a / √3

Since the second peak corresponds to the second smallest d value, we find that the second peak corresponds to the (110) plane.

So the correct answer is:

[(D) (110)]
