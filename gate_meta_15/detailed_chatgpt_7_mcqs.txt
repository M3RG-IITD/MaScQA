The addition of oxide can result in different effects on the silicate slag network depending on the type of oxide added. In this case, we need to find which oxide addition results in polymerization, i.e., the formation of a more extensive network.

(A) CaO: Calcium oxide is a basic oxide that tends to increase the basicity (i.e., decrease the acidity) of the slag. The addition of CaO can result in the formation of calcium silicates (e.g., Ca$_{2}$SiO$_{4}$) that contribute to the slag network. However, CaO does not lead to significant polymerization unless it is added in high concentrations.

(B) MgO: Magnesium oxide is also a basic oxide that can contribute to slag basicity, similar to CaO. However, MgO has a smaller ionic radius than CaO, which makes it more effective at breaking up the slag network rather than forming new linkages. Therefore, MgO addition is not expected to result in significant polymerization.

(C) $P_{2}O_{5}$: Phosphorus oxide is an acidic oxide that can react with basic oxides (e.g., CaO, MgO) to form phosphates in the slag. The phosphates can act as cross-linkers between silicates, leading to polymerization. Therefore, $P_{2}O_{5}$ addition can result in significant network formation.

(D) $Na_{2}O$: Sodium oxide is a basic oxide that tends to decrease slag viscosity and surface tension. Sodium oxide can promote the diffusion of ions in the slag and, thus, help to break up the slag network. Therefore, $Na_{2}O$ addition is not expected to result in significant polymerization.

In conclusion, the correct answer is (C) $P_{2}O_{5}$.
