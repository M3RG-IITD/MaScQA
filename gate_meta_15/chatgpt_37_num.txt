The overall reaction is:

Cu-Ni(s)  +  Ni2+(aq) →  Cu2+(aq)  +  Ni(s)

The standard reduction potential at 298 K for the half-reactions are:

Ni2+(aq) + 2e- → Ni(s)    E° = -0.25 V

Cu2+(aq) + 2e- → Cu(s)    E° = +0.34 V

At the anode, oxidation of Ni to Ni2+ will occur, and Cu will not oxidize because it is more noble than Ni. The overall reaction is then:

Ni(s) →  Ni2+(aq) + 2e-    E = +0.25 V

At the cathode, reduction of Ni2+ to Ni will occur, and Cu2+ will not reduce because it is less noble than Ni. The overall reaction is then:

Ni2+(aq) + 2e- → Ni(s)    E = -0.25 V

The cell potential is the difference between the anode and cathode potentials:

Ecell = Ecathode – Eanode
       = (-0.25) – (+0.25)
       = -0.5 V

The Gibbs free energy change of the reaction is given by:

ΔG° = -nFE°

where n is the number of electrons exchanged, F is the Faraday constant, and E° is the cell potential at standard conditions. Since one mole of electrons is transferred in the reaction, n = 1. The temperature is 300 K, and R = 8.314 J $mol^(-1)K^(-1)$:

ΔG° = -nFE°
        = -(1)(96490)(-0.5)
        = 48245 J $mol^(-1)$

The voltage required for the reaction to proceed is given by the equation:

ΔG = -nFE

where ΔG is the Gibbs free energy change at non-standard conditions, and E is the cell potential. At equilibrium, ΔG = 0:

0 = -nFE + RTlnQ

where Q is the reaction quotient. For an ideal solution, the reaction quotient is:

Q = [Ni2+]/[Ni][Cu2+]

Since the cathode is pure Ni, [Ni]/1 = 1. Let x be the concentration of Cu in the anode. Then [Ni2+] = x and [Cu2+] = 0.1 – x. Substituting into the equation:

0 = -nFE + RTlnQ
      = -1(96490)E + (8.314)(300)ln[x/(0.1 – x)]

Solving for E:

E = (RT/nF)ln[x/(0.1 – x)]
   = (8.314/96490)ln[x/(0.1 – x)]
   = 0.086 ln[x/(0.1 – x)]

Taking the absolute value and converting to mV:

|Ecell| =  |E| × 1000
              = |0.086 ln[x/(0.1 – x)]| × 1000
              
The minimum voltage occurs when the concentration of Cu is such that the maximum amount of Ni2+ is reduced at the cathode. This occurs when the concentration of Cu in the anode is equal to the concentration of Ni2+ in the electrolyte, or when:

x = [Ni2+] = 1 mol $dm^(-3)$

Substituting into the equation:

|Ecell| = |0.086 ln[(1)/(0.1 – 1)]| × 1000
             = 724.3 mV

Therefore, the absolute value of the minimum voltage required for refining is 724.3 mV.
