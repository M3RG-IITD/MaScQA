To determine the amount of iron ore required to produce 1000 kg of hot metal, we first need to find out how much iron is present in 1000 kg of hot metal and then calculate the amount of iron ore required to yield that amount of iron.

We are given that the hot metal contains 95% Fe, so the amount of iron in 1000 kg of hot metal would be:

1000 kg * 0.95 = 950 kg of Fe

Now, we need to find out how much $Fe_{2}O_{3}$ contains this amount of iron. Since one mole of $Fe_{2}O_{3}$ contains 2 moles of Fe, let's calculate the amount of $Fe_{2}O_{3}$ in moles that would contain 950 kg of Fe. The atomic weight of Fe is 56 g/mol, so:

950 kg = 950000 g
Amount of Fe in moles = 950000 g / 56 g/mol = 16964.29 moles

Now, knowing that 1 mole of $Fe_{2}O_{3}$ contains 2 moles of Fe, the amount of $Fe_{2}O_{3}$ required is:

Amount of $Fe_{2}O_{3}$ (in moles) = 16964.29 moles / 2 = 8482.14 moles

Now, convert the amount of $Fe_{2}O_{3}$ required to grams. The molecular weight of $Fe_{2}O_{3}$ is 160 g/mol, so:

Amount of $Fe_{2}O_{3}$ (in grams) = 8482.14 moles * 160 g/mol = 1357138.24 g

Since the iron ore contains 95% $Fe_{2}O_{3}$, we need to find out how much iron ore is needed to obtain 1357138.24 g of $Fe_{2}O_{3}$. Let's denote the amount of iron ore needed with x.

0.95 * x = 1357138.24

Now, to solve for x:

x = 1357138.24 / 0.95
x = 1428572.88 g

Converting grams to kilograms:

x = 1428572.88 g / 1000
x = 1428.57 kg

So, 1428.57 kg of iron ore is required for producing 1000 kg of hot metal.

Answer: [1428.57]
