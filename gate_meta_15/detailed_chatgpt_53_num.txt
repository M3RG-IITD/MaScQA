Given:
Burgers vector of dislocation 1, b1 = (a/2)<110>
Burgers vector of dislocation 2, b2 = (a/6)<112>

We know the strain energy per unit length of a dislocation with Burger's vector b is given by:

U = μb²/4π(1-ν) 

where μ is the shear modulus of the material and ν is its Poisson's ratio.

We are given that the strain energy per unit length of the first dislocation is x times that of the second dislocation. Therefore, we can write:

U1 = xU2

Substituting the expressions for U given above:

μb₁²/4π(1-ν) = xμb₂²/4π(1-ν)

Simplifying the above expression:

b₁² = x b₂²

Substituting the expressions for b1 and b2 that are given, we get:

(a²/4)<110>² = x (a²/36)<112>²

Simplifying the above expression:

4<110>² = 9x<112>²

Substituting the values of the Miller indices:

4(1² + 1²+0²) = 9x(1² +1² + 2²)

Simplifying the above expression:

8x = 4 + 6

x = (4 + 6)/8

x = 1.25

Therefore, the value of x is 1.25.

Answer: [1.25]
