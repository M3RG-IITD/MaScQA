Let's first analyze each surface feature in Group I and match it with the appropriate fracture mechanisms in Group II:

P. Striations - These are typically found in fatigue fractures. They appear as concentric, continuous lines on the fracture surface, indicating the consecutive stages of crack propagation. Therefore, P matches with 4 (fatigue fracture).

Q. Dimples and microvoids - These are the characteristics of ductile fractures. Dimples are formed when the material is being stretched, and microvoids are small cavities that appear during the plastic deformation process. Together, they indicate a substantial amount of energy absorption, which is a key feature of ductile fractures. Therefore, Q matches with 3 (ductile fracture).

R. Flat facets and "river markings" - These are the characteristics of cleavage fractures. Flat facets are formed when a definite crystallographic plane exists, and river markings are patterns that appear as the crack propagates through the material. Cleavage fractures usually occur in materials with a regular and symmetric arrangement of atoms. Therefore, R matches with 2 (cleavage fracture).

S. Jagged surface with grain-like features - These are the characteristics of intergranular fractures. An intergranular fracture occurs along the grain boundaries in a material, making the fracture surface appear grainy or jagged. This type of fracture happens when grain boundary regions of the material are weakened, which causes the fracture to propagate along these boundaries instead of through the grains. Therefore, S matches with 1 (intergranular fracture).

Thus, the correct matching is as follows:
P - 4 (fatigue fracture)
Q - 3 (ductile fracture)
R - 2 (cleavage fracture)
S - 1 (intergranular fracture)

So, the correct answer inside a list is [(C)].
