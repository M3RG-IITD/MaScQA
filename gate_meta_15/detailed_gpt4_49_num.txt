Sintering is the process of particle coagulation and densification that happens under the influence of driving forces arising due to the reduction in the surface area of the particle at higher temperatures. One of the major factors affecting the sintering process is the surface to volume ratio. For a spherical particle, the surface to volume ratio depends on its radius, given by $\frac{Surface \: Area}{Volume} = \frac{4\pi R^2}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3} = \frac{3}{R}$. As the driving force for sintering is directly proportional to the surface to volume ratio, we can write:

$\Delta G_1 \propto \frac{3}{R_1}$ and $\Delta G_2 \propto \frac{3}{R_2}$

Dividing both equations:

$\frac{\Delta G_2}{\Delta G_1} = \frac{3/R_2}{3/R_1}$

Given that $R_2 = 0.1 R_1$, we can substitute this value in the above equation:

$\frac{\Delta G_2}{\Delta G_1} = \frac{3/(0.1R_1)}{3/R_1} = \frac{3}{0.1R_1} \cdot \frac{R_1}{3} = \frac{1}{0.1} = 10$

So, $\alpha = \frac{\Delta G_2}{\Delta G_1} = 10$

Thus, the driving force for sintering $\Delta G_2$ is 10 times the driving force of the initial particle size $\Delta G_1$. The correct answer is:
