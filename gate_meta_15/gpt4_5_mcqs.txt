The standard free energy change ∆G° is related to the standard enthalpy change ∆H° and the standard entropy change ∆S° by the following equation:

∆G° = ∆H° - T∆S°

Since the Ellingham diagram plots ∆G° as a function of temperature T, the slope of the line is given by the derivative of ∆G° with respect to T:

d(∆G°)/dT = d(∆H° - T∆S°)/dT

As the standard enthalpy change ∆H° is a constant, its derivative with respect to T is 0. So, the expression simplifies to:

d(∆G°)/dT = -∆S°

The slope is positive, which means -∆S° is positive, so ∆S° must be negative.

The correct answer is: (B) ∆S° is negative.
