We can use the conservation of volume to solve this problem, assuming that the material is incompressible.

The volume of the original cylindrical billet is:

V1 = π(0.25 m)^2(1.0 m) = 0.0491 m^3

The volume of the final cylindrical pancake is:

V2 = π(r2^2)(0.25 m)

where r2 is the new radius of the pancake.

If we assume that the volume is conserved, we can set V1 = V2 and solve for r2:

π(0.25 m)^2(1.0 m) = π(r2^2)(0.25 m)

r2^2 = (0.25^2)(1.0)

r2 = 0.5 m

Therefore, the diameter of the cylindrical pancake is 0.5 meters.

Answer: [0.5 m]
