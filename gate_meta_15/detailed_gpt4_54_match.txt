Let's first understand the mechanical properties in Group I and their corresponding microstructural features in Group II:

Group I:
P. Creep resistance - The ability to withstand slow deformation under high temperatures and prolonged stress.
Q. Elastic modulus enhancement - Improvement in elastic properties, like stiffness and rigidity.
R. Superplasticity - The capacity to undergo large uniform deformation without cracking.
S. Increased strength - Improved resistance to deformation under applied force.

Group II:
1. Fine-grained two-phase microstructure - Such structures usually lead to increased strength and toughness.
2. Single crystal - Single crystals exhibit better creep resistance due to the absence of grain boundaries.
3. Coherent precipitates - These precipitates are known to provide increased strength to the material.
4. Glass fibers in epoxy - The presence of glass fibers enhances the elastic modulus of the composite material.

Now, let's match the properties from Group I with the appropriate microstructural features from Group II:

P. Creep resistance → 2. Single crystal
The absence of grain boundaries in single crystals makes them more resistant to creep deformation.

Q. Elastic modulus enhancement → 4. Glass fibers in epoxy
The elastic modulus of composite materials is enhanced with the addition of glass fibers within the epoxy matrix.

R. Superplasticity → 1. Fine-grained two-phase microstructure
Fine-grained materials with two-phase microstructures typically exhibit greater superplasticity due to finer grain structure.

S. Increased strength → 3. Coherent precipitates
The presence of coherent precipitates within the matrix of a material can lead to an increase in the overall strength of the material.

So, the correct matchings are:
P-2, Q-4, R-1, S-3

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(C) P-2, Q-4, R-1, S-3
