To find the crystal system to which the given crystal belongs, we need to analyze the conditions provided regarding the unit cell parameters (𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐) and angles (𝛼, 𝛽, 𝛾).

Step 1: Analyze the conditions for the unit cell parameters.

Given: 𝑎 = 𝑏 ≠ 𝑐. This means that two of the unit cell parameters (𝑎 and 𝑏) have the same value and the third parameter (𝑐) has a different value.

Step 2: Analyze the conditions for the angles in the unit cell.

Given: 𝛼 = 𝛽 = 𝛾 = 90°. This means that all three angles in the unit cell are equal to 90°.

Step 3: Identify the crystal system based on the conditions.

Now, let's check which crystal system satisfies the given conditions:

(A) Cubic: In a cubic crystal system, all three unit cell parameters are equal (𝑎 = 𝑏 = 𝑐) and all angles are 90° (𝛼 = 𝛽 = 𝛾 = 90°). This does not match the given conditions, as 𝑎 = 𝑏 ≠ 𝑐.

(B) Tetragonal: In a tetragonal crystal system, two unit cell parameters are equal (𝑎 = 𝑏 ≠ 𝑐) and all angles are 90° (𝛼 = 𝛽 = 𝛾 = 90°). This matches the given conditions.

(C) Orthorhombic: In an orthorhombic crystal system, all unit cell parameters are unequal (𝑎 ≠ 𝑏 ≠ 𝑐) and all angles are 90° (𝛼 = 𝛽 = 𝛾 = 90°). This does not match the given conditions, as 𝑎 = 𝑏 ≠ 𝑐.

(D) Triclinic: In a triclinic crystal system, all unit cell parameters are unequal (𝑎 ≠ 𝑏 ≠ 𝑐) and all angles are unequal (𝛼 ≠ 𝛽 ≠ 𝛾 ≠ 90°). This does not match the given conditions, as 𝑎 = 𝑏 ≠ 𝑐 and 𝛼 = 𝛽 = 𝛾 = 90°.

So, based on the given conditions, the crystal belongs to the Tetragonal crystal system (option B).
