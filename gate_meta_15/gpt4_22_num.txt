The stress required for Orowan dislocation bypass is related to the inter-precipitate spacing (d) as follows:

stress = K / d

where K is a constant of proportionality. 

Given that the stress is 200 MPa when the inter-precipitate spacing is 500 nm, we can find the constant K:

K = stress * d
K = 200 MPa * 500 nm

Now, we need to find the stress required when the inter-precipitate spacing is reduced to 200 nm. Using the same formula:

stress_new = K / d_new

where d_new is the new inter-precipitate spacing (200 nm).

stress_new = (200 MPa * 500 nm) / 200 nm

stress_new = 500 MPa

So, the stress required for Orowan dislocation bypass when the inter-precipitate spacing is reduced to 200 nm is 500 MPa.

Answer: [500]
