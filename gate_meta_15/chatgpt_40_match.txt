The correct answer is:

(C) P-2, Q-4, R-1, S-3. 

Explanation: 

- Eutectic refers to a mixture of two or more solid phases that coexist at the same composition and temperature. A eutectic reaction involves a liquid phase transforming at a constant temperature and composition into two or more solid phases. Therefore, eutectic corresponds to reaction 2: 𝐿 → 𝛼 + 𝛽. 

- Peritectic refers to a reaction between a solid and a liquid phase, resulting in the formation of a new solid phase. Peritectic corresponds to reaction 4: 𝐿 + 𝛽 → 𝛼. 

- Peritectoid refers to a reaction between two solid phases, resulting in the formation of a new solid phase. Peritectoid corresponds to reaction 1: 𝛾 + 𝛽 → 𝛼. 

- Monotectic refers to a reaction involving a liquid phase separating into two distinct liquid phases. Monotectic corresponds to reaction 3: 𝐿1 → 𝐿2 + 𝛼.
