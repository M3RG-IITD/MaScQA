The correct answer is (C) ($𝜌_2$ − $𝜌_1$)𝑔𝐻.

The pressure difference between points P and Q should be equal to the hydrostatic pressure created due to the difference in densities of the two fluids (water and mercury). This difference in pressure is given by the hydrostatic pressure equation, which can be represented as:

ΔP = ($𝜌_2$ − $𝜌_1$)𝑔𝐻

Where:
ΔP = pressure difference between points P and Q
$𝜌_1$ = density of water
$𝜌_2$ = density of mercury
g = acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s²)
H = height difference between the two fluids

Therefore, the correct answer is [($𝜌_2$ − $𝜌_1$)𝑔𝐻].
