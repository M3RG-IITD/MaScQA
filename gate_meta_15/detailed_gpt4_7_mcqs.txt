To determine which of the given oxide additions results in polymerization (i.e., network formation) in a silicate slag, we need to understand the concept of basicity and acidity in the context of silicate slags.

Silicate slags are composed of silica (SiO₂) and other oxides. The basicity of a silicate slag is determined by the ratio of the concentrations of basic oxides (such as CaO, MgO) to the concentrations of acidic oxides (such as SiO₂).

Polymerization of the silicate network results from the sharing of oxygen atoms between SiO₄ tetrahedra. The degree of polymerization depends on the presence of network modifier cations (such as Na⁺, Ca²⁺), which disrupt the silicate network by breaking the Si-O-Si bridges, thereby reducing the polymerization.

Now let's analyze each oxide addition:

(A) CaO: Calcium oxide (CaO) is a basic oxide. When added to the silicate slag, it would act as a network modifier, disrupting Si-O-Si bridges and reducing the degree of polymerization.

(B) MgO: Magnesium oxide (MgO) is also a basic oxide. Like CaO, it would act as a network modifier, reducing the degree of polymerization in the silicate slag.

(C) P₂O₅: Phosphorus pentoxide (P₂O₅) is an acidic oxide. When added to the silicate slag, it introduces phosphate groups that can form P-O-Si bridges and increase the degree of polymerization. This is because P₂O₅ can form cross-links between silicate chains, thereby promoting network formation.

(D) Na₂O: Sodium oxide (Na₂O) is a basic oxide as well. The addition of Na₂O introduces sodium ions (Na⁺) which act as network modifiers and disrupt the silicate network, reducing the degree of polymerization.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is:

(C) P₂O₅
