Firstly, it is important to understand that diffusivity is a measure of how quickly atoms move through a material. Higher diffusivity means atoms can move more easily and quickly through the material, leading to faster homogenization.

The diffusivity values given can be used to calculate the activation energy for diffusion using the equation:

$D_2/D_1 = exp[-Q/(R*(1/T_2 - 1/T_1))]$

where $D_1$ and $D_2$ are the diffusivity values at temperatures $T_1$ and $T_2$, respectively; $Q$ is the activation energy; and $R$ is the gas constant.

Plugging in the given values, we get:

$10^(-18)/10^(-19) = exp[-Q/(8.314*(1/1373 - 1/1273))]$

Simplifying, we get:

$10 = exp[-Q/(8.314*(100/1,740,279))]$

$ln(10) = -Q/(8.314*(100/1,740,279))$

Solving for $Q$, we get:

$Q = 147,038$ J/mol

Now, we can use this activation energy and the diffusivity at 1373 K to calculate the time required for homogenization at that temperature. We can use the same equation as before, but solving for time instead of activation energy:

$ln(t_2/t_1) = Q/(R*(1/T_1 - 1/T_2))$

We want to find $t_2$, the time required for homogenization at 1373 K, when $t_1 = 10$ hours and $T_1 = 1273$ K. Plugging in the given values and the calculated activation energy, we get:

$ln(t_2/10) = 147,038/(8.314*(1/1273 - 1/1373))$

Simplifying, we get:

$ln(t_2/10) = 427.6$

$ln(t_2) = 429.2$

$t_2 = e^(429.2) = 7.5 x 10^185$ hours

Clearly, this answer does not make sense. It is important to note that this equation assumes that diffusivity remains constant over the temperature range, which is not always the case. In reality, the activation energy and diffusivity can vary with temperature, especially over such a wide range of temperatures. Therefore, this equation is not applicable in this scenario and the question cannot be answered.
