To determine the incorrect statement related to the effect of a small amount of carbon addition on mechanical properties of iron, let's analyze each statement:

(A) Ductile-Brittle-Transition-Temperature (DBTT) increases: 
Ductile-Brittle Transition Temperature (DBTT) is the temperature at which materials shift from ductile (deforming) to brittle (breaking) behavior. When carbon is added to iron, the resulting material (steel) generally has a higher DBTT than pure iron. This is because carbon present in the interstitial sites of the iron lattice can make it more difficult for dislocations to move, increasing the brittleness of the material.

(B) Hardenability increases: 
Hardenability refers to the ability of a material to be hardened through a heat treatment process, such as quenching. The addition of carbon to iron increases its hardenability, as it produces martensite upon quenching, which is a harder and stronger phase of steel than the ferrite found in pure iron. 

(C) Toughness increases: 
Toughness is the ability of a material to absorb energy and deform plastically before breaking. While a small amount of carbon addition to iron may improve certain mechanical properties, adding too much carbon will decrease the overall toughness of the material because it will lead to the formation of brittle carbide phases that act as stress concentrators and propagation points for cracks.

(D) Yield point phenomenon occurs: 
Yield point phenomenon is an elastic-plastic transition behavior observed in some low carbon steels and iron alloys, where a distinct yield point is observed in their stress-strain curve, with a sudden drop in the stress right after the elastic limit is exceeded, followed by a recovery to a higher level of stress. This phenomenon occurs due to the presence of interstitial solute atoms, such as carbon, which hinder dislocation motion. When the yield point is exceeded, the dislocations suddenly break free, leading to the observed stress drop and subsequent increase.

Based on the analysis of the statements above, we can conclude that:

- Statement (A) is correct because the addition of carbon to iron increases the Ductile-Brittle Transition Temperature.
- Statement (B) is correct because the addition of carbon to iron increases its hardenability.
- Statement (C) is incorrect because adding carbon to iron increases brittleness and decreases toughness.
- Statement (D) is correct because the addition of carbon to iron causes the yield point phenomenon to occur.

Therefore, the incorrect statement is:

[C]
