Step 1: Understanding the question and given information.
We are given a question about improving the creep resistance of polymers such as epoxies. We need to choose an option that can enhance or improve creep resistance. Let's understand what creep resistance means.
Creep is the slow and gradual deformation of a material under stress. In other words, a material that is supposed to be rigid under normal conditions starts to deform over time under continuous stress. Creep resistance is the ability of a material to withstand or resist such deformation. 
Now, let's look at the given options.

Step 2: Analyzing and eliminating the incorrect options.
Option (C) addition of plasticizers is not correct because plasticizers are added to increase flexibility and reduce brittleness of a material. They do not improve creep resistance.
Option (D) annealing is not correct because although annealing can reduce internal stresses and improve some mechanical properties, it does not improve creep resistance.
Option (A) increasing the bulkiness of side groups is partially correct because bulky side groups can prevent close molecular packing and therefore reduce potential sites for chain slippage. But, it is not a foolproof method and may not always work.

Step 3: Choosing the correct option.
Option (B) increasing the cross-link density is the correct option because polymers that are highly cross-linked have fewer potential sites for chain mobility and therefore have improved creep resistance. Cross-linking involves the formation of strong chemical bonds between the polymer chains, which results in a more rigid and durable structure with improved creep resistance.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
- (B) increasing the cross-link density.
