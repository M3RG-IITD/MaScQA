Orowan's equation is given by: 

$\tau = \frac{\mu b}{d}$

Where,  
$\tau$ is the critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) required for dislocation bypass  
$\mu$ is the shear modulus of the material  
$b$ is the Burgers vector of the dislocation  
$d$ is the inter-precipitate spacing  

Given,  
$\tau_1 = 200$ MPa  
$d_1 = 500$ nm = $500 \times 10^{-9}$ m  

To find: $\tau_2$ when $d_2 = 200$ nm = $200 \times 10^{-9}$ m  

We can assume that the shear modulus and Burgers vector remain constant.

Using Orowan's equation, we can write:

$\tau_1 = \frac{\mu b}{d_1}$

Solving for $\mu b$, we get:

$\mu b = \tau_1 d_1$

Now, for the new inter-precipitate spacing of $d_2 = 200$ nm, we can write:

$\tau_2 = \frac{\mu b}{d_2}$

Substituting the value of $\mu b$ from the previous equation, we get:

$\tau_2 = \frac{\tau_1 d_1}{d_2}$

Substituting the given values, we get:

$\tau_2 = \frac{(200 \times 10^6 \text{ Pa})(500 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m})}{200 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m}} = \boxed{500 \text{ MPa}}$

Therefore, the stress required for Orowan dislocation bypass when the inter-precipitate spacing is reduced to 200 nm is 500 MPa.
