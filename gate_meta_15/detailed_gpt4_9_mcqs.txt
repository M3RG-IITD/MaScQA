To answer this question, let's evaluate the given options and analyze their relation to self-supporting arches for furnace roofs.

(A) Silica has a significantly lower thermal expansion coefficient than magnesia at high temperatures.

Thermal expansion coefficient is an important property to consider for materials subjected to high temperatures, as it indicates how much a material will expand or contract as a result of temperature changes. A material with a lower thermal expansion coefficient will typically exhibit less expansion and contraction, which contributes to improved stability during temperature fluctuations. With a lower thermal expansion coefficient, silica bricks in a self-supporting arch are less likely to crack or lose structural integrity when exposed to high temperatures in a furnace.

(B) Silica has a significantly higher thermal conductivity than magnesia at high temperatures.

Thermal conductivity determines how efficiently a material transfers heat. A higher thermal conductivity could be beneficial in evenly distributing heat in a furnace, but it doesn't directly affect the structural integrity of a self-supporting arch. Therefore, this is not a decisive factor.

(C) Silica has a significantly lower melting point than magnesia.

A lower melting point would be a disadvantage for a material used in furnace roofs, as it would be more prone to melting under high temperatures. However, silica bricks have a melting point of around 1710Â°C, which is still quite high compared to many other materials. This option is not a valid reason for why silica bricks can be used in self-supporting arches and magnesia bricks cannot.

(D) Silica is significantly more acidic than magnesia.

This statement is true, as silica is a highly acidic refractory material, while magnesia is a more basic refractory material. However, this fact doesn't directly contribute to the ability of silica bricks to be used in self-supporting arches for furnace roofs.

Based on these analyses, we can conclude that:

The correct answer is (A) Silica has a significantly lower thermal expansion coefficient than magnesia at high temperatures.

This property of silica bricks contributes to their ability to maintain structural integrity and resist cracking under the high temperatures experienced in furnace roofs, making them suitable for self-supporting arches.
