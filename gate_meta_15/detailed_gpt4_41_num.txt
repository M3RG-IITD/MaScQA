To find the time required for homogenization at 1373 K, we can use the relationship between diffusivity, temperature, and homogenization time. 

The diffusivity of a material is heavily dependent on its temperature. In general, as temperature increases, the diffusivity also increases. This relationship can be described by the Arrhenius equation:

$$D(T) = D_0e^{-\frac{Q}{RT}}$$

Where:
- $D(T)$ is the diffusivity at temperature $T$
- $D_0$ is a constant known as the pre-exponential factor
- $Q$ is the activation energy for diffusion
- $R$ is the ideal gas constant
- $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin

We are given the diffusivities at two temperatures, 1373 K and 1273 K:

$$D_(1373K) = 10^{-18} m^2s^{-1}$$
$$D_(1273K) = 10^{-19} m^2s^{-1}$$

We can set up a ratio between the two diffusivities using the Arrhenius equation:

$$\frac{D_(1373K)}{D_(1273K)} = \frac{D_0e^{-\frac{Q}{R(1373)}}}{D_0e^{-\frac{Q}{R(1273)}}}$$

Since $D_0$ is a constant, it cancels out in the equation:

$$\frac{10^{-18}}{10^{-19}} = e^{\frac{Q}{R}\left(\frac{1}{1273} - \frac{1}{1373}\right)}$$

Now, we need to solve for the activation energy, $Q$. First, simplify the equation:

$$10 = e^{\frac{Q}{R}\left(\frac{1}{1273} - \frac{1}{1373}\right)}$$

Take the natural logarithm of both sides:

$$\ln(10) = \frac{Q}{R}\left(\frac{1}{1273} - \frac{1}{1373}\right)$$

Now, isolate $Q$:

$$Q = R\ln(10)\left(\frac{1373-1273}{1273\cdot1373}\right)$$

We know the ideal gas constant $R = 8.314 J\cdot K^{-1}mol^{-1}$,

So, let's plug in the value to find $Q$:

$$Q = 8.314\ln(10)\left(\frac{1373-1273}{1273\cdot1373}\right)$$

$$Q \approx 920.55 J\cdot mol^{-1}$$

Now that we have the activation energy, we can use the relationship between diffusivity and homogenization time. The homogenization time is proportional to the inverse of the diffusivity:

$$t \propto \frac{1}{D(T)}$$

We can set up another ratio for the homogenization times at the two temperatures:

$$\frac{t_{1373}}{t_{1273}} = \frac{D_{1273}}{D_{1373}}$$

We know that it takes 10 hours to homogenize at 1273 K:

$$t_{1273} = 10\, hours$$

Now, let's find the ratio of diffusivities:

$$\frac{D_{1273}}{D_{1373}} = \frac{10^{-19}}{10^{-18}} = \frac{1}{10}$$

Now, we can set up an equation to find the homogenization time at 1373 K:

$$\frac{t_{1373}}{10\, hours} = \frac{1}{10}$$

Solve for $t_{1373}$:

$$t_{1373} = \frac{10\, hours}{10}$$

$$t_{1373} = 1\, hour$$

Therefore, the time required to achieve the same extent of homogenization at 1373 K is 1 hour.

The answer is [1].
