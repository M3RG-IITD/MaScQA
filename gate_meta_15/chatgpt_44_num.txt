Based on the given information, we can construct a tie-line on the phase diagram as shown below:

The tie-line intersects the α phase at around $X_{\alpha}$ = 0.4. This means that the composition of the α phase in equilibrium with the given alloy is also 0.4. Since the overall composition of the alloy is $X_B$ = 0.7 and the phase fraction of β is 0.75, we can calculate the composition of the β phase as follows:

$0.7 = 0.4 \times (1-0.75) + 0.9 \times 0.75$

$0.7 = 0.4 \times 0.25 + 0.675$

$0.025 = 0.4 - X_{\alpha}$

$X_{\alpha} = 0.4 - 0.025 = 0.375$

Therefore, the maximum solubility of B in α at this temperature is 0.375.

Answer: [0.375]
