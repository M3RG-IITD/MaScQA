To solve this problem, we'll use the lever rule based on the overall composition of the alloy and the compositions of the individual phases α and β. 

The overall composition of the alloy, $X_B$, is given as 0.7, and the phase fraction of β, $f_{β}​$, is given as 0.75. Let $X_α$ be the composition of α and $X_β$ be the composition of β.

We know that the equilibrium composition of β at temperature $T_1$ is given as 0.9:

$$X_β = 0.9$$

Now, we will find the phase fraction of α, $f_{α}​$:

Since there are only two phases, α and β:

$$f_{α}​ = 1 - f_{β}​ = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25$$

Now we'll apply the lever rule. The lever rule states that the overall composition of the alloy equals the sum of the compositions of the individual phases multiplied by their phase fractions:

$$X_B = f_{α}​ X_α + f_{β}​ X_β$$

We have values for $X_B$, $f_{α}$, $f_{β}$, and $X_β$. We can substitute these values into the equation above and solve for $X_α$:

$$0.7 = (0.25)X_α + (0.75)(0.9)$$

$$0.7 = 0.25X_α + 0.675$$

To solve for $X_α$, subtract 0.675 from both sides:

$$0.7 - 0.675 = 0.25X_α$$

$$0.025 = 0.25X_α$$

To find $X_α$, divide both sides by 0.25:

$$X_α = \frac{0.025}{0.25} = 0.1$$

The maximum solubility of B in α (in mole fraction) at this temperature is 0.1.

The correct answer is [0.1].
