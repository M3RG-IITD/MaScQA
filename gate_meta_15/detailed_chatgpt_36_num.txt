Unfortunately, there is no figure attached to this question. However, we can still solve the problem using the information given.

The cumulative size distribution curve tells us the percentage of particles that are smaller than a given size. For example, if the graph shows that 50% of the particles are smaller than 100 microns, that means that half of the particles have a size of less than 100 microns.

To solve the problem, we need to use the following formula:

Weight retained = (Weight of original sample) x (% retained / 100)

We are given that the original sample weighs 10 kg. We also know that the material has already been passed through a sieve of size 400 microns. Let's assume that all particles larger than 400 microns have been removed, and we are left with only particles smaller than 400 microns.

Looking at the cumulative size distribution curve, we can find the percentage of particles that are smaller than 300 microns. Let's say this percentage is X. Then, the percentage of particles that are between 300 and 400 microns is (100 - X).

When we pass the material through the 300 micron sieve, we are removing all particles larger than 300 microns. Therefore, the weight of material retained on the 300 micron sieve is:

Weight retained = (Weight of original sample) x (% of material between 300 and 400 microns / 100)

Weight retained = (10 kg) x ((100 - X) / 100)

Answer: [(10 kg) x ((100 - X) / 100)] kg of material is retained on the 300 micron sieve.
