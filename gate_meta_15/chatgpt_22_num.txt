Assuming Orowan's equation is applicable, 

τ = Gb/λd

where τ is the stress required for dislocation bypass, G is the shear modulus of the material, b is the magnitude of the Burgers vector for the dislocation, λ is the average inter-precipitate spacing and d is the effective diameter of the precipitates.

Let us assume the values of G and b are constant. 

When λ = 500 nm, τ = 200 MPa. 

Therefore, 200 = Gb/(500 x d)

When λ = 200 nm, the stress required can be represented as τ'.

Therefore, We can write  τ' = Gb/(200 x d)

Dividing the two equations, we get:

τ'/τ = (λ/200)

Substituting the given values, we get:

τ' = 80 MPa

Therefore, the stress required when the inter-precipitate spacing is reduced to 200 nm is 80 MPa.

Answer: [80]
