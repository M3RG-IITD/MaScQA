Let's analyze the options to find the correct reason for the positive slope of the Ellingham diagram for the oxidation reaction of a metal M.

Option A: ∆S° is positive
The standard entropy change (∆S°) is a measure of the change in the randomness or disorder of a system. For the given oxidation reaction, we have solid metal (M) and oxygen gas on the reactant side, and a solid metal oxide on the product side. The conversion of gas to solid generally results in a decrease in overall randomness, which means that ∆S° should be negative. Hence, option A is incorrect.

Option B: ∆S° is negative
As we discussed above, the oxidation reaction where a gas is converted to a solid typically results in decreased randomness of the system. Therefore, the standard entropy change (∆S°) should indeed be negative in this case.

Option C: ∆H° is positive
The standard enthalpy change (∆H°) represents the change in heat energy in a system. A positive ∆H° would suggest that the reaction is endothermic, meaning heat is absorbed during the reaction. In the case of oxidation reactions, heat is generally released, making the reaction exothermic, which implies a negative ∆H°. Therefore, option C is not correct.

Option D: ∆H° is negative
As explained in option C, for oxidation reactions, the release of heat energy makes them exothermic, which means the standard enthalpy change (∆H°) should be negative.

Now let's relate these findings to the slope of the Ellingham diagram. The standard free energy change ∆G° is given by the equation:

∆𝐺° = ∆𝐻° - 𝑇∆𝑆°

Taking the derivative with respect to temperature (T), we get:

d(∆G°)/dT = -∆S°

We have concluded that ∆S° is negative for this reaction. As a result, the negative of ∆S° (i.e., -∆S°) in the right-hand side of the equation will be positive. Therefore, the slope of the line (d(∆G°)/dT) in the Ellingham diagram will be positive.

So, the correct reason for the positive slope is that the standard entropy change (∆S°) is negative.

The correct answer is [B].
