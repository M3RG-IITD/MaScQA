To solve this problem, we need to analyze and understand the given information:

1. The mineral is crushed into particles, whose cumulative size distribution is given in the figure (not provided).
2. The sample of 10 kg is first passed through a sieve of size 400 microns.
3. The remaining particles are then passed through a sieve of size 300 microns.

Step 1: Determine the percentage of particles smaller than 400 microns
From the given figure (not provided), one has to find the cumulative percentage of particles with a size smaller than or equal to 400 microns. Let's say this percentage is P1.

Step 2: Determine the weight of particles smaller than 400 microns
The total weight of the 10 kg sample multiplied by P1 will give us the weight of the particles that pass through the 400-micron sieve.

Weight_Particles_Passed_400_microns = 10 kg * P1
Let this weight be W1.

Step 3: Determine the percentage of particles between 300 and 400 microns
From the given figure (not provided), one has to find the cumulative percentage of particles with a size smaller than or equal to 300 microns. Let's say this percentage is P2.

Now, since we want to know the percentage of particles between 300 and 400 microns, we need to subtract P2 from P1:

Percentage_Particles_300_to_400_microns = P1 - P2
Let this percentage be P3.

Step 4: Determine the weight of particles between 300 and 400 microns
The total weight of particles that passed through the 400-micron sieve (W1) multiplied by P3 will give us the weight of the particles retained on the 300-micron sieve:

Weight_Particles_Retained_on_300_microns = W1 * P3

Finally, we can substitute the value of W1 and P3 calculated in previous steps to get the answer to the problem.

Without the actual figure we can't give the exact numerical answer for this problem, but the general approach to solving it would be as follows:

1. Find the cumulative percentage of particles smaller than or equal to 400 microns (P1) from the figure.
2. Calculate the weight of particles smaller than 400 microns (W1) using the provided information: 10 kg sample weight multiplied by P1.
3. Find the cumulative percentage of particles smaller than or equal to 300 microns (P2) from the figure.
4. Calculate the percentage of particles between 300 and 400 microns (P3) by subtracting P2 from P1.
5. Calculate the weight of particles retained on the 300-micron sieve by multiplying W1 by P3.

The final answer is: [Weight_Particles_Retained_on_300_microns]
