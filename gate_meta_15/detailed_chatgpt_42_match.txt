P. Iron-Silicon alloy - 3. Transformer core
Q. GaAs - 4. Light emitting diode
R. Nichrome - 1. Heating element
S. Quartz crystals - 2. Ultrasonic generator

Explanation: 
- Iron-Silicon alloys have high magnetic permeability and low coercivity. They are used in transformer cores.
- GaAs (Gallium Arsenide) is a semiconductor material used in the production of LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) of various colors.
- Nichrome is an alloy of nickel and chromium that resists oxidation and is used in heating elements due to its high electrical resistance.
- Quartz crystals have piezoelectric properties, meaning they can convert mechanical energy into electrical energy and vice versa. They are used in ultrasonic generators.

Therefore, the correct option is (A) P-3, Q-4, R-1, S-2.
