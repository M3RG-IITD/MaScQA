To find the minimum voltage for refining, we need to calculate the cell potential of the electrochemical reaction between the Cu-Ni alloy and pure Ni. 

First, let's announce the chemical reactions happening at the anode and cathode. At the anode, copper dissolves into the solution, so the reaction is:

Cu(s) -> Cu^2+ (aq) + 2e^-

At the cathode, nickel ions are reduced to form pure nickel:

Ni^2+ (aq) + 2e^- -> Ni(s)

The overall cell reaction is:

Cu(s) + Ni^2+ (aq) -> Cu^2+ (aq) + Ni(s)

Now, we need to find the standard cell potential for this reaction. The standard cell potential (E°) is the difference between the standard reduction potentials of the cathode and the anode:

E° = E°(cathode) - E°(anode)

The standard reduction potentials for Cu and Ni are:

E°(Cu^2+/Cu) = +0.337 V
E°(Ni^2+/Ni) = -0.257 V

Now, we can calculate the standard cell potential E°:

E° = E°(Ni^2+/Ni) - E°(Cu^2+/Cu) = -0.257 - (+0.337) = -0.594 V

Next, we need to account for the non-standard conditions of the Cu-Ni alloy. We can use the Nernst equation to determine the cell potential at non-standard conditions:

E = E° - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)

Where:
E is the cell potential under non-standard conditions
R is the gas constant (8.314 J $mol^(-1)K^(-1)$)
T is the temperature in Kelvin (300 K)
n is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction (2)
F is the Faraday constant (96490 C $mol^(-1)$)
Q is the reaction quotient

For ideal solutions, the activity coefficients are equal to 1. Therefore, the reaction quotient Q can be replaced by the molar concentrations:

Q = [Cu^2+] / [Ni^2+]

Given that the Cu-Ni solution is 10 atom% Ni, the ratio of concentrations is:

[Ni^2+] / [Cu^2+] = 10 / 90 = 1 / 9

Thus, Q = 9

Now we can plug in the values into the Nernst equation:

E = -0.594 - (8.314 * 300 / (2 * 96490)) * ln(9)
E = -0.594 - (0.0129) * ln(9)
E ≈ -0.640 V

Since we need the ABSOLUTE value of the minimum voltage, we simply take the positive value of the calculated voltage:

|-0.640| = 0.640 V

Now we can convert volts to millivolts:

0.640 V * 1000 = 640 mV

Therefore, the ABSOLUTE value of the minimum voltage required for refining is:

[[640]] mV
