To solve this question, we need to analyze each metal and the extraction routes associated with each metal according to the given groups.

1) P. Al (Aluminum):
Aluminum is extracted mainly by the electrolysis of its fused salt (commonly alumina, Al2O3), using the Hall-HÃ©roult process. This process involves dissolving aluminum oxide in molten cryolite, which is a refractory material. The molten mixture is then subjected to an electric current, extracting pure aluminum from the mixture. So, for Aluminum the correct extraction route is 3. Electrolysis of Fused Salts.

2) Q. Ti (Titanium):
The extraction of titanium usually involves a process known as the Kroll process, which makes use of a reduction method called halide metallurgy, specifically titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4). Magnesium is used as a reducing agent to convert the TiCl4 into titanium metal. So, for Titanium the correct extraction route is 4. Halide Metallurgy.

3) R. Cu (Copper):
Copper is usually extracted by a process called matte smelting, which separates copper from its ores by melting them in a furnace containing silica. The combined mixture of copper and iron sulfides forms a matte layer that floats on top of the other molten materials in the furnace. The matte layer is then subjected to further processing to extract pure copper. So, for Copper the correct extraction route is 2. Matte Smelting.

4) S. Fe (Iron):
Iron is extracted mainly by the blast furnace process, which involves reducing iron oxide ores with coke (carbon) in a large vertical furnace. The coke reacts with the oxygen in the ore, forming carbon dioxide and reducing the iron oxide to molten iron, which sinks to the bottom of the furnace. So, for Iron the correct extraction route is 1. Blast Furnace.

So, the correct matching of metals with the extraction routes is as follows:

P. Al - 3. Electrolysis of Fused Salts
Q. Ti - 4. Halide Metallurgy
R. Cu - 2. Matte Smelting
S. Fe - 1. Blast Furnace

This matches option (B) in the list:
