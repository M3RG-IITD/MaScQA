(Atomic weight of Fe = 56 g $mol^(-1)$ and that of $Fe_(2)O_(3)$ = 160 g $mol^(-1)$). An iron blast furnace produces hot metal containing 95% Fe. The iron ore charged into the furnace contains 95% $Fe_(2)O_(3)$ and the rest is gangue. Assume that all the iron in the ore goes to hot metal. The amount of iron ore (in kg) required for producing 1000 kg of hot metal is ?
