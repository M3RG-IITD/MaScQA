Assume that both solid and liquid remain at the melting point while they are in the mould. At the mould exit of a continuous caster, the metal consisting of a solidified shell with a liquid metal core exits at the rate of 35 kg $s^(-1)$. Given that the latent heat of fusion is 3 × $10^(5) J $kg^(-1)$ and the total rate of heat removal by the mould is 4.2 × $10^6$ W, the mass fraction of solid at the mould exit is?
