Griffith’s theory states that the fracture strength of a brittle material with a flaw of length $c$ and surface energy $\gamma_s$ is given by:

$\sigma_f = \sqrt{\frac{2E \gamma_s}{\pi c}}$

Where $\sigma_f$ is the fracture strength, $E$ is the Young’s modulus of the material, and $c$ is the length of the flaw.

We are given that in medium P, the fracture strength of the material is 300 MPa. We can now use this information to solve for the flaw length $c$.

$300 \text{ MPa} = \sqrt{\frac{2E \times 0.9\text{ J/m}^2}{\pi c}}$

Rearranging and solving for $c$:

$c = \frac{2E \times 0.9\text{ J/m}^2}{\pi \times (300 \text{ MPa})^2} = 1.13 \times 10^{-9}\text{ m}$ 

Now that we know $c$, we can use Griffith’s theory to calculate the fracture strength in medium Q.

$\sigma_{f,Q} = \sqrt{\frac{2E \times 0.1\text{ J/m}^2}{\pi \times 1.13 \times 10^{-9}\text{ m}}} = \boxed{707 \text{ MPa}}$

Therefore, the fracture strength of the material in medium Q according to Griffith’s theory is 707 MPa.
