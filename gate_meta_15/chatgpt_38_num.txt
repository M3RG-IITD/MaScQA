The expression for configurational entropy due to ideal mixing in a binary A-B system is:

$∆S_{mix} = -R*(X_A*ln[X_A] + X_B*ln[X_B])$

where $X_A$ and $X_B$ are mole fractions of A and B respectively.

To find the maximum value of $∆S_{mix}$, we need to take the derivative of $∆S_{mix}$ with respect to $X_A$ and set it equal to zero:

$\frac{d ∆S_{mix}}{d X_A} = -R*(ln[X_A] + 1) + R*ln[X_B]$

Setting this equal to zero, we get:

$-R*(ln[X_A] + 1) + R*ln[X_B] = 0$

$ln[X_A] = ln[X_B] - 1$

$X_A = e^{ln[X_B] - 1}$

$X_A = e^{ln[X_B]} * e^{-1}$

$X_A = X_B * e^{-1}$

Therefore, $∆S_{mix}$ is maximum when $X_A = X_B * e^{-1}$.

Answer: [$X_A = X_B * e^{-1}$]
