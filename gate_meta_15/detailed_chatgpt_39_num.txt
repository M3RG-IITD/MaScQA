We are given that,

Melting point of the metal = 1356 K

Undercooled temperature for solidification of metal  = 1256 K

Free energy change for solidification at 1256K, $∆G^(L→S)$ = -1000 J $mol^(-1)$

Let's calculate the change in free energy when the metal is cooled from melting point (1356 K) to undercooled temperature (1256 K).

$ΔG_{1356 \to 1256}^{L \to S} = -\Delta G_{1256}^{L \to S} = 1000$ J mol$^{-1}$

This means that a free energy of 1000 J is released per mole of metal as it solidifies during this temperature change.

Now, let's calculate the change in free energy when the metal is cooled further to 1200 K.

$∆G_{1256 \to 1200}^{L \to S}$ = ?

We can use the following equation to relate the two temperature intervals.

$ΔG_{total}^{L \to S} = ΔG_{1356 \to 1256}^{L \to S} + ΔG_{1256 \to 1200}^{L \to S}$

$ΔG_{total}^{L \to S} = 1000\ J\ mol^{-1} + ΔG_{1256 \to 1200}^{L \to S}$

Rearranging the equation to solve for $ΔG_{1256 \to 1200}^{L \to S}$, we get

$ΔG_{1256 \to 1200}^{L \to S} = ΔG_{total}^{L \to S} - 1000\ J\ mol^{-1}$

Now, to calculate $ΔG_{total}^{L \to S}$, we need to know the amount of temperature change from the melting point (1356 K) to the final undercooled temperature of 1200 K.

$ΔT = 1356\ K - 1200\ K = 156\ K$

Using the formula for free energy change during a phase transition (where $ΔH$ is the enthalpy change and $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin),

$ΔG = ΔH - TΔS$

we can write the following equation for the free energy change during solidification:

$ΔG_{L \to S} = -ΔH_{L \to S}$

Rearranging this equation, we get

$ΔH_{L \to S} = -ΔG_{L \to S}$

We can use this equation to find the enthalpy change during solidification (which is the same as the enthalpy change during melting but with the opposite sign).

From the given information, we know that the melting point of the metal is 1356 K. Therefore, the enthalpy change during melting is

$ΔH_{S \to L} = 1356\ K mol^{-1}$

Since solidification is the reverse of melting, the enthalpy change during solidification is

$ΔH_{L \to S} = - ΔH_{S \to L} = -1356\ K\ mol^{-1}$

Now we can use both the enthalpy and free energy changes to calculate the entropy change during solidification using the formula:

$ΔG = ΔH - TΔS$

where $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.

$ΔG_{L \to S} = ΔH_{L \to S} - TΔS_{L \to S}$

$-1000\ J\ mol^{-1}$ = $-1356\ K\ mol^{-1}$ - $(1200\ K)\ ΔS_{L \to S}$

Rearranging this equation to solve for $ΔS_{L \to S}$, we get

$ΔS_{L \to S}$ = $\frac{-1000\ J\ mol^{-1} + 1356\ K\ mol^{-1}}{1200\ K}$

$ΔS_{L \to S}$ = $0.296\ J\ K^{-1} mol^{-1}$

Therefore, the free energy change during solidification from 1256 K to 1200 K is given by:

$ΔG_{1256 \to 1200}^{L \to S} = ΔH_{L \to S} - TΔS_{L \to S}$

$ΔG_{1256 \to 1200}^{L \to S} = (-1356) - (1200)(0.296)$

$ΔG_{1256 \to 1200}^{L \to S} = -793.2$ J $mol^{-1}$

So the free energy change (in J $mol^(-1)$) for solidification of liquid metal when cooled from 1256 K to 1200 K is -793.2 J $mol^(-1)$. 

The final answer is:

[-793.2 J/mol]
