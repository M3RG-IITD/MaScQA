To solve this problem, we need to use the lever rule. The lever rule states that for a binary system, the fractional amount of a phase in equilibrium is inversely proportional to the lengths of the line segments of the tie line that lie opposite the phase.

The overall composition of the alloy $X_B$ = 0.7. The equilibrium composition of phase β at temperature $T_1$ = 0.9. 

The phase fraction of β = 0.75, so the phase fraction of α = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25.

The lever rule is applied in the following manner:

$X_{α} - X_B = f_{β} * (X_{β} - X_{α})$

We know that $X_B$ = 0.7, $X_{β}$ = 0.9, and $f_{β}$ = 0.75. We have:

$X_{α} - 0.7 = 0.75 * (0.9 - X_{α})$

Let's solve for $X_{α}$. First, distribute 0.75:

$X_{α} - 0.7 = 0.675 - 0.75X_{α}$

Now, add 0.75$X_{α}$ to both sides:

$1.75X_{α} - 0.7 = 0.675$

Now, add 0.7 to both sides:

$1.75X_{α} = 1.375$

Finally, divide both sides by 1.75:

$X_{α} = 0.7857$

Therefore, the maximum solubility of B in α (in mole fraction) at temperature $T_1$ is 0.7857.

Answer: [0.7857]
