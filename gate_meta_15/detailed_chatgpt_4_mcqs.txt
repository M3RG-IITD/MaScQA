To determine which of the properties is intensive, we need to understand the difference between intensive and extensive properties. 

- Intensive properties are those that do not depend on the amount or size of the system. Examples include temperature, pressure, density, and molar mass.
- Extensive properties, on the other hand, are those that depend on the amount or size of the system. Examples include volume, mass, energy, and entropy.

Using this definition, we can determine that:

(A) Volume is an extensive property since it depends on the size of the system.
(B) Gibbs free energy is an extensive property since it depends on the energy and entropy of the system.
(C) Chemical potential is an intensive property since it does not depend on the size of the system.
(D) Entropy is an extensive property since it depends on the size of the system.

Therefore, the answer is:

- (C) Chemical potential
