To find the minimum voltage required for refining, we need to calculate the difference in electrochemical potential between the two electrodes, which is given by the Nernst equation:

ΔE = -RT/nF * ln(Q)

Here, ΔE is the electrochemical potential difference, R is the gas constant (8.314 J $mol^(-1)K^(-1)$), T is the temperature (300 K), n is the number of electrons transferred per mole of reactant (for both Cu and Ni, it's 2), F is the Faraday constant (96490 C $mol^(-1)$), and Q is the reaction quotient.

In this case, the reaction quotient Q is given by the ratio of the activity of Ni in the anode over the activity of Ni in the cathode. For an ideal solution, the activity of Ni is equal to its mole fraction in the anode (X_Ni). Since the anode has 10 atom% Ni, the mole fraction of Ni is 0.1. In the cathode, the activity of Ni is 1 due to its pure form.

Now, we have all the values needed to calculate ΔE:

ΔE = -8.314 J $mol^(-1)K^(-1)$ * 300 K / (2 * 96490 C $mol^(-1)$) * ln(0.1)

ΔE ≈ -0.01294 V
or
ΔE ≈ -12.94 mV

Since we are asked the absolute value of the minimum voltage required, the answer is:

[12.94]
