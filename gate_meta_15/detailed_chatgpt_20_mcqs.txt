The metal forming technique used to produce soft drink cans from aluminium sheets is:

(C) Deep Drawing

Explanation:

Rolling is a metal forming process in which the metal is passed through a pair of rotating rolls to reduce its thickness and increase its length. This process is used to produce sheets, plates, and coils of various metals. Rolling is not used for producing soft drink cans from aluminum sheets.

Forging is a metal forming process that involves the application of force to deform and shape metal. Usually, forging is used to make parts, tools, and equipment by deforming metal using a hammer, a press or a rolling machine, but it is not used to produce soft drink cans from aluminum sheets.

Extrusion is a metal forming process where a metal billet is forced through a die to create a specific shape. Extrusion is used to make long, uniform shapes with a consistent cross-section. Extrusion is not used to produce soft drink cans from aluminum sheets.

Deep drawing is a metal forming process in which a flat sheet metal blank is drawn into a die cavity to form a cylindrical or box-shaped part. This process is used to make complex shapes with tight tolerances. The deep drawing process is used to produce soft drink cans from aluminum sheets by first drawing the aluminum sheet into a cup shape and then ironing them to create a can shape.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Deep Drawing
