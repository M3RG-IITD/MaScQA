To find the maximum of $ΔS_{mix}$, we need to determine the values of $X_A$ and $X_B$ that maximize the given expression. Since $X_A + X_B = 1$, we can rewrite the expression in terms of a single variable:

$ΔS_{mix} = -R*(X_A * ln[X_A] + (1 - X_A) * ln[1 - X_A])$

Now we will find the maximum value by taking the derivative of $ΔS_{mix}$ with respect to $X_A$:

$\frac{d(ΔS_{mix})}{dX_A} = -R*(ln[X_A] - ln[1 - X_A])$

We'll find the critical points by setting the derivative equal to zero:

$0 = ln[X_A] - ln[1 - X_A]$

Now using properties of logarithms, we can rewrite this equation as:

$ln\frac{X_A}{1 - X_A} = 0$

Taking the exponential of both sides, we get:

$\frac{X_A}{1 - X_A} = 1$

Solving for $X_A$, we have:

$X_A = 1 - X_A$

This gives us the value:

$X_A = 0.5$

Therefore, the maximum of $ΔS_{mix}$ occurs when $X_A = 0.5$.

Answer: [0.5]
