To determine the conditions that favor the forward reaction, we can use Le Chatelier's principle, which states that if a dynamic equilibrium is disturbed by changing the conditions, the position of equilibrium shifts in the direction that acts to counteract the change.

Given the reaction:

C (s) + CO2 (g) ⇋ 2CO (g)

The balanced chemical equation tells us that the number of moles of reactants and products, as well as the physical states they are present in, are:

1 mole of solid carbon (C) + 1 mole of gaseous carbon dioxide (CO2) ⇋ 2 moles of gaseous carbon monoxide (CO)

We are also given that the change in enthalpy for this reaction, ΔH°(298), is positive (172,000 J/mol of CO2). This means the forward reaction is endothermic (absorbs heat from the surroundings).

Now let's examine each of the options:

(A) Increasing both temperature and pressure:
Increasing the temperature will favor the endothermic (forward) reaction, as the system will try to absorb the extra heat. Increasing pressure will favor the side with fewer moles of gas, which is the reactant side (1 mole of CO2 vs. 2 moles of CO). So increasing both temperature and pressure will have mixed effects on the forward reaction.

(B) Decreasing temperature and increasing pressure:
Decreasing the temperature will not favor the endothermic (forward) reaction. Increasing pressure will favor the side with fewer moles of gas, which is the reactant side. So both of these changes will not favor the forward reaction.

(C) Decreasing both temperature and pressure:
Decreasing the temperature will not favor the endothermic (forward) reaction. Decreasing pressure will favor the side with more moles of gas, which is the product side. So decreasing both temperature and pressure will have mixed effects on the forward reaction.

(D) Increasing temperature and decreasing pressure:
Increasing the temperature will favor the endothermic (forward) reaction. Decreasing pressure will favor the side with more moles of gas, which is the product side. So increasing temperature and decreasing pressure will both favor the forward reaction.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is:

[D]
