Refer the figure. In froth flotation, hydrophobic mineral particles ascend with air bubbles preferentially over hydrophilic mineral particles. The figure below shows a schematic of a water droplet placed on the surfaces of two mineral P and Q. Given this information, pick the CORRECT statement from the following:
(A) Mineral P ascends with air bubbles preferentially over mineral Q. (B) Mineral Q ascends with air bubbles preferentially over mineral P. (C) Both minerals P and Q ascend with the air bubbles without preference. (D) Both minerals P and Q sink to the bottom
