(A) Ductile-Brittle-Transition-Temperature (DBTT) increases is the correct answer. 

Explanation:

The addition of a small amount of carbon to iron can have different effects on its mechanical properties depending on the amount of carbon added. However, one of the incorrect statements about this effect is that the Ductile-Brittle-Transition-Temperature (DBTT) increases. In fact, the opposite is true, the addition of carbon can shift the DBTT to a lower temperature, meaning that the material will become more brittle at lower temperatures.

The other statements are true:
- Hardenability increases: the ability of the material to harden by heat treatment increases with the carbon content.
- Toughness increases: the ability of the material to absorb energy before fracturing increases with the carbon content up to a certain point.
- Yield point phenomenon occurs: the addition of carbon can cause a distinct yield point in the stress-strain curve, after which the material behaves plastically rather than elastically.
