P. Macrosegregation: It is the non-uniform distribution of alloying elements or composition within the casting caused by density differences and convection currents during solidification.  
Reason: 4. Density difference and convection currents.

Q. Fine grained structure: It is the feature of having small and uniform grain size in the casting.  
Reason: 3. Temperature gradients and supercooling.

R. Porosity: It is the presence of voids or cavities in the casting.  
Reason: 2. Gas evolution and shrinkage.

S. Dendrites: It is a crystal structure formed during solidification, which gives a treelike appearance.  
Reason: 1. Inoculation.

Therefore, the correct matching option is (D) P-4, Q-1, R-3, S-2.
