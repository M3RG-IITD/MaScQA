Group I: 

P. Eutectic - A mixture of two or more solid phases that melt or solidify simultaneously at a single temperature that is lower than for any other composition of the same components. 

Q. Peritectic - A reaction in which a solid and a liquid phase react to form a single, solid phase at a specific temperature and composition. 

R. Peritectoid - A reaction in which two solid phases react to form a single, solid phase at a specific temperature and composition. 

S. Monotectic - A reaction in which a single liquid phase separates into two liquid phases upon cooling.

Group II: 

1. 𝛾 + 𝛽 → 𝛼 - A reaction in which two solid phases react to form a single, different solid phase. 

2. 𝐿 → 𝛼 + 𝛽 - A reaction in which a liquid phase solidifies into two different solid phases. 

3. 𝐿1 → 𝐿2 + 𝛼 - A reaction in which a liquid phase transforms into a different liquid phase and a solid phase. 

4. 𝐿 + 𝛽 → 𝛼 - A reaction in which a liquid phase and a solid phase react to form a single, different solid phase. 

Based on these definitions, we can match the names in Group I with the corresponding reactions in Group II as follows: 

P. Eutectic - 𝐿 → 𝛼 + 𝛽 

Q. Peritectic - 𝐿1 → 𝐿2 + 𝛼 

R. Peritectoid - 𝛾 + 𝛽 → 𝛼 

S. Monotectic - 𝐿 + 𝛽 → 𝛼 

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(C) P-2, Q-4, R-1, S-3
