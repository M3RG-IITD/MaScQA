To solve this problem, we need to use Lever rule. The Lever rule states that the fraction of a two-phase (or multiphase) system that is in one phase is proportional to the distance between the overall composition of the system and the composition of the tie line that connects the two phase regions on a phase diagram. 

Here's how to use the Lever rule to solve this problem: 

1. Draw the tie line that connects the two-phase region on the phase diagram.

2. Determine the composition of each phase using the tie line. Since the overall composition of the alloy is $X_B$ = 0.7 and the phase fraction of β is 0.75, we can use the following equation to determine the compositions of the two phases: 

$X_{\alpha} = \frac{X_B - X_{\beta}}{X_{\alpha} - X_{\beta}} \times (1 - \phi_{\beta})$

$X_{\beta} = \frac{X_B - X_{\alpha}}{X_{\beta} - X_{\alpha}} \times \phi_{\beta}$

where $X_{\alpha}$ and $X_{\beta}$ are the compositions of the two phases, $\phi_{\beta}$ is the volume fraction of the β phase, and $X_{B}$ is the overall composition of the alloy. 

Plugging the given values into these equations gives: 

$X_{\alpha} = \frac{0.7 - 0.9}{0.4 - 0.9} \times (1 - 0.75) = 0.086$

$X_{\beta} = \frac{0.7 - 0.086}{0.9 - 0.086} \times 0.75 = 0.614$ 

So the compositions of the two phases are $X_{\alpha} = 0.086$ and $X_{\beta} = 0.614$. 

3. Use the lever rule to determine the maximum solubility of B in α. The lever rule equation is: 

$\frac{\text{fraction of }\alpha}{\text{fraction of }\beta} = \frac{X_B - X_{\beta}}{X_{\alpha} - X_{\beta}}$

Since we want to find the maximum solubility of B in α, we can rearrange this equation to solve for $X_{\alpha}$: 

$X_{\alpha} = X_{\beta} - \frac{X_{\beta} - X_B}{\text{fraction of }\alpha / \text{fraction of }\beta}$

Plugging in the known values gives: 

$X_{\alpha} = 0.614 - \frac{0.614 - 0.7}{0.25 / 0.75} = 0.523$

Therefore, the maximum solubility of B in α at temperature $T_1$ is 0.523. 

Answer: 
- 0.523
