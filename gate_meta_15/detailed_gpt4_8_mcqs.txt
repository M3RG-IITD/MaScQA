To find out which of the given minerals is used for the commercial extraction of Zn (zinc), let's analyze each option:

(A) Sphalerite
Sphalerite, also known as zinc blende or zinc sulfide (ZnS), is the primary ore of zinc. This means that zinc is obtained from sphalerite through various extraction processes.

(B) Magnetite
Magnetite is an iron ore, which is mainly composed of iron(II,III) oxide, Fe3O4. It is a source of iron and not zinc.

(C) Chalcopyrite
Chalcopyrite is a copper ore, primarily consisting of copper iron sulfide (CuFeS2). Although it sometimes contains traces of zinc, it is mainly used for extracting copper.

(D) Galena
Galena is a lead ore, which is mainly composed of lead sulfide (PbS). It is the primary source of lead, not zinc.

From the analysis, it is clear that Zn is commercially extracted from sphalerite.
