Creep resistance in polymers is an essential property that determines their long-term behavior when subjected to stress or load, especially at elevated temperatures or in harsh environments. Enhancements in creep resistance can significantly improve the performance, durability, and service-life of polymer materials. Let's analyze each of the given options to determine which one(s) is/are correct:

(A) Increasing the bulkiness of side groups:
The bulkiness of side groups can hinder the movement of polymer chains that may occur under stress or load, which can lead to an improvement in creep resistance. Large side groups may physically impede the slippage of adjacent chains and create a more rigid and stable network, allowing the material to withstand stress for more extended periods without significant deformation. Thus, this option is valid.

(B) Increasing the cross-link density:
Cross-linking is a process in which individual polymer chains are connected to each other by chemical bonds, forming a three-dimensional network structure. Higher cross-link density leads to a more robust and stable network, which improves the mechanical properties of the polymer, including its creep resistance. More cross-linking points can resist the slippage of the chains in the presence of stress, which further contributes to better creep resistance. This option is also valid.

(C) Addition of plasticizers:
Plasticizers are additives that decrease glass transition temperature, increase flexibility, and enhance the workability of a polymer. The addition of plasticizers can have the opposite effect on creep resistance, as they facilitate chain mobility and reduce the intermolecular forces between the polymer chains. Thus, this option is not valid.

(D) Annealing:
Annealing is a heat treatment process often applied to relieve the internal stresses within a material, especially after manufacturing or processing. It can enhance the polymer's overall performance by reallocating the stresses more uniformly across the material. However, annealing does not directly improve creep resistance, and its effect on this property may depend on the specific polymer and its initial state. Thus, this option does not always enhance creep resistance.

In conclusion, the correct answer is [A, B], as increasing the bulkiness of side groups and increasing the cross-link density can enhance creep resistance in polymers such as epoxies.
