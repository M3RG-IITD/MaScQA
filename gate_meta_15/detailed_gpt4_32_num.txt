To find the equilibrium ratio of the partial pressures of CO2 and CO at 1200 K and 1 atm, we can use the equation for the reaction quotient, Q, and the standard Gibbs free energy change, ∆G°.

At equilibrium, ∆G = 0, therefore:

∆G = ∆G° + RT ln(Q)

Where ∆G° is the standard Gibbs free energy change, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol K), T is the temperature (1200 K), and Q is the reaction quotient.

Now we can solve for the reaction quotient, Q:

0 = -8000 J/mol + (8.314 J/mol K) * (1200 K) * ln(Q)

8000 J/mol = (8.314 J/mol K) * (1200 K) * ln(Q)

Now, divide both sides by (8.314 J/mol K) * (1200 K):

8000 / (8.314 * 1200) = ln(Q)

0.807 = ln(Q)

Exponentiate both sides to solve for Q:

Q = e^(0.807) ≈ 2.24

The reaction quotient (Q) is a dimensionless number that relates the product of the partial pressures of the products to the product of the partial pressures of the reactants. In this case, the reaction is:

Fe3O4(s) + CO(g) ⇌ 3FeO(s) + CO2(g)

Since the solid phases do not contribute to the partial pressures, the reaction quotient Q can be given as:

Q = p(CO2) / p(CO)

Therefore, the equilibrium ratio of the partial pressures of CO2 and CO at 1200 K and 1 atm is:

p(CO2) / p(CO) ≈ 2.24

So, the correct answer is:
