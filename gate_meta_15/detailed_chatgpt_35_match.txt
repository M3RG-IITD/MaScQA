P. Al -  Electrolysis of Fused Salts
Q. Ti -  Halide Metallurgy
R. Cu -  Matte Smelting 
S. Fe -  Blast Furnace

Explanation:

Aluminum is extracted by electrolysis of fused salts (cryolite). Ti (Titanium) can be purified by halide metallurgy. Copper is obtained from its sulfide ore by smelting in a matte smelting furnace. Whereas, iron is extracted from iron ore in a blast furnace.

Therefore, the correct option is (Solved) - 
(B) P-3, Q-4, R-2, S-1
