To solve this problem, let's first understand the given situation and the question.

We have a pipe with water flowing through it, and points P and Q inside the pipe. A water-over-mercury manometer is used to measure the pressure difference between points P and Q. We are asked to find the correct expression for this pressure difference. 

Let's denote the pressure at point P as $P_P$ and the pressure at point Q as $P_Q$. The pressure difference between points P and Q can be written as $ΔP = P_P - P_Q$.

Now let's analyze the manometer. There are two columns of fluid in the manometer: one column with fluid of density $ρ_1$ (which is water) and height $h$, and another column with fluid of density $ρ_2$ (which is mercury) and height $H$. In order to find the pressure difference between P and Q, we need to find how the pressure changes in each column of fluid.

Let's first consider the column with fluid of density $ρ_1$ and height $h$. Starting at the top of the column (at point P) and moving down to the bottom of the column (at the interface of fluid 1 and fluid 2), the change in pressure in this column can be calculated using the hydrostatic pressure formula:

$ΔP_1 = ρ_1gh$

Next, let's consider the column with fluid of density $ρ_2$ and height $H$. Starting at the bottom of the column (at the interface of fluid 1 and fluid 2) and moving up to the top of the column (at point Q), the change in pressure in this column can be calculated using the hydrostatic pressure formula:

$ΔP_2 = ρ_2gH$

Since the pressure difference between P and Q ($ΔP$) is the sum of the pressure changes in the two columns of fluid, we can write:

$ΔP = ΔP_1 - ΔP_2 = ρ_1gh - ρ_2gH$

By factoring out $g$ from the equation, we get:

$ΔP = g(ρ_1h - ρ_2H)$

Comparing our result to the given answer choices, we can rewrite it as follows:

$ΔP = g(ρ_2 - ρ_1)(-H)$

Now, identify the correct choice:

(A) $ρ_2gH$ -- This is incorrect; it does not account for the density of fluid 1;
(B) $ρ_1gh$ -- This is incorrect; it does not account for the density of fluid 2;
(C) $(ρ_2 - ρ_1)gH$ -- This is incorrect; the calculated expression has a negative sign;
(D) $(ρ_2 - ρ_1)gh$ -- This is the correct answer.

So, the correct answer is:

$ΔP = (ρ_2 - ρ_1)gh \Rightarrow \boxed{[\text{D}]}$.
