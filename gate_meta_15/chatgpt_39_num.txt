We can use the relation:

$∆G = ∆H - T∆S$

Where,
∆G = Free energy change
∆H = Enthalpy change
T = Temperature
∆S = Entropy change

At the melting point (1356 K), the free energy change for solidification can be written as:

$∆G_1 = ∆H_1 - T_1∆S_1$

At an undercooled temperature of 1256 K, the free energy change can be written as:

$∆G_2 = ∆H_2 - T_2∆S_2$

We know, $∆G_1 = -1000 J mol^{-1}$, $T_1 = 1356 K$, and $\∆S_1$ (change in entropy) will be negative as the solid has less disorder than the liquid. Assuming that $\∆H_1$ and $\∆S_2$ do not change significantly on this temperature scale, we can write:

$-1000 = ∆H_1 - 1356\∆S_1$

Similarly, at an undercooled temperature of 1200 K, we can write:

$∆G_3 = ∆H_3 - T_3∆S_3$

Assuming that $\∆H_3$ and $\∆S_3$ do not change significantly on this temperature scale, we can write:

$∆G_3 = ∆G_1 - (T_3 - T_1)\∆S_1$

Substituting the values of $∆G_1$ and $T_1$, we get:

$∆G_3 = -1000 - (1200 - 1356) \∆S_1$

Simplifying, we get:

$∆G_3 = -1000 + 156\∆S_1$

Therefore, the free energy change for solidification at an undercooled temperature of 1200 K is $-1000 + 156\∆S_1$ J $mol^(-1)$.

Answer: 
$-1000 + 156\∆S_1$ J $mol^(-1)$
