The X-Ray powder pattern for a simple cubic crystal follows the rule that the sum of the squares of the Miller indices (h² + k² + l²) must be a perfect square. 

2nd peak:
(111): h² + k² + l² = 1² + 1² + 1² = 3 (Not a perfect square)
(100): h² + k² + l² = 1² + 0² + 0² = 1 (Perfect square)
(200): h² + k² + l² = 2² + 0² + 0² = 4 (Perfect square)
(110): h² + k² + l² = 1² + 1² + 0² = 2 (Not a perfect square)

Out of the given options, (100) and (200) correspond to perfect squares. However, we are looking for the 2nd peak, so (100) is the first peak, and (200) is the second peak.

Answer: [(200)]
