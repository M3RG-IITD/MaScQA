According to the Griffith's theory of brittle fracture, the fracture strength ($σ_f$) of a material with a critical flaw size ($c$) is as follows:

$σ_{f} = \sqrt{\dfrac{2 E 𝛾_s}{π c}}$

Here, $E$ is the elastic modulus of the material. The fracture strength is given for medium P, and we are supposed to find the fracture strength for medium Q.

Let's denote the fracture strength in medium P with the surface energy of $𝛾_{s_P}$ = 0.9 J $m^{−2}$ and fracture strength $σ_{f_P}$ as 300 MPa. For medium Q, the surface energy is $𝛾_{s_Q}$ = 0.1 J $m^{−2}$ and we need to find the fracture strength $σ_{f_Q}$.

First, we get the critical flaw size $c$ using medium P's data:

$σ_{f_P} = \sqrt{\dfrac{2 E 𝛾_{s_P}}{π c}}$
$300 × 10^6 = \sqrt{\dfrac{2E(0.9)}{π c}}$

Now, we square both sides of the equation:

$(300 × 10^6)^2 = \dfrac{2E(0.9)}{π c}$
$c = \dfrac{2E(0.9)}{π × (300 × 10^6)^2}$ ---(1)

Now, let's find the fracture strength in medium Q:

$σ_{f_Q} = \sqrt{\dfrac{2 E 𝛾_{s_Q}}{π c}}$
$σ_{f_Q} = \sqrt{\dfrac{2E(0.1)}{π c}}$

We already have the value of $c$ in equation (1), so we can substitute it here:

$σ_{f_Q} = \sqrt{\dfrac{2E(0.1)}{π × \dfrac{2E(0.9)}{π × (300 × 10^6)^2}}}$

Simplifying the equation:

$σ_{f_Q} = \sqrt{\dfrac{(0.1) × π × (300 × 10^6)^2}{(0.9)}}$
$σ_{f_Q} = \sqrt{\dfrac{(300 × 10^6)^2}{9}}$

Taking square root both sides:

$σ_{f_Q} = \dfrac{300 × 10^6}{3} = 100 × 10^6$

Putting the value in MPa:

$σ_{f_Q} = 100$ MPa

So, the fracture strength of the material in medium Q is 100 MPa.
