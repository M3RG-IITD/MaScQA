To answer this question, we'll need to know the basic principles of diffusion-controlled oxidation kinetics.

Diffusion-controlled oxidation kinetics is the process by which oxidation occurs due to the movement of atoms or ions through a solid, such as the oxide layer on a metal surface. This process can be described mathematically by Fick's Laws of Diffusion.

According to Fick's first law, the rate of oxidation is directly proportional to the concentration gradient, i.e., the rate of movement of oxidizing species(face, e.g., O2) through the oxide layer (x) is proportional to the change in concentration across the layer (dC/dx). 

Fick's second law states that the change in concentration of oxidizing species in the oxide layer with respect to time is proportional to the diffusion of oxidizing species through the oxide layer (∆x). Mathematically, it can be written as:

∂C/∂t = D * ∂²C/∂x²

Here,
- ∂C/∂t is the change in concentration with respect to time (oxidation kinetics)
- D is the diffusion coefficient (depends on temperature and material properties)
- ∂²C/∂x² is the second derivative of concentration with respect to the adherent oxide layer thickness

For diffusion-controlled oxidation kinetics, we're primarily concerned with the relationship between the adherent oxide layer thickness (∆x) and time (t). To find this relationship, we'll need to integrate Fick's second law.

Integrating Fick's second law with respect to thickness (∆x) and time (t), we get:

∆x = √(Dt)

This equation suggests that the adherent oxide layer thickness (∆x) is proportional to the square root of time (t) in diffusion-controlled oxidation kinetics.

Now, let's examine the options (A) P, (B) Q, (C) R, and (D) S to determine which curve represents diffusion-controlled oxidation kinetics based on the relationship derived above.

(A) P: This curve suggests a linear relationship between ∆x and t. This is not the case for diffusion-controlled oxidation kinetics, as we've deduced.

(B) Q: This curve suggests a logarithmic relationship between ∆x and t. Again, this does not match the derived relationship for diffusion-controlled oxidation kinetics.

(C) R: This curve suggests a relationship between ∆x and t as ∆x ∝ √t, which matches the relationship derived for diffusion-controlled oxidation kinetics. Therefore, this is the correct answer.

(D) S: This curve suggests an exponential relationship between ∆x and t, which is not the case for diffusion-controlled oxidation kinetics we derived.

So, the correct answer representing diffusion-controlled oxidation kinetics is (C) R.

Answer: [R]
