We are given the expression for configurational entropy due to ideal mixing in a binary A-B system:
$∆S_{mix}$ = -R*( $X_{A}*ln[X_{A}]$ +   $X_{B}ln[X_{B}]$)

We want to find the value of $X_A$ such that $∆S_{mix}$ is maximum. To do this, we will calculate the first and second derivatives with respect to $X_A$, set the first derivative equal to zero, and check that the second derivative is negative.

First, we note that $X_B = 1 - X_A$ since they are mole fractions in a binary system.

Now, proceed with finding the first derivative of $∆S_{mix}$ with respect to $X_A$:

$\frac{d(∆S_{mix})}{dX_A} = \frac{d(-R \cdot (X_A\cdot ln[X_A] + (1-X_A)\cdot ln[1-X_A]))}{dX_A}$

Using the chain rule and product rule:

$\frac{d(∆S_{mix})}{dX_A} = -R \cdot (\frac{1}{X_A} - \frac{1}{1-X_A})$

Now, we set the first derivative to zero and solve for $X_A$:

$-R \cdot (\frac{1}{X_A} - \frac{1}{1-X_A}) = 0$

$\frac{1}{X_A} - \frac{1}{1-X_A} = 0$

Multiply both sides by $X_A \cdot (1-X_A)$ to eliminate fractions:

$(1-X_A) - X_A = 0$

$1 - 2X_A = 0$

$X_A = \frac{1}{2}$

Now, let's check the second derivative to ensure this value corresponds to a maximum:

$\frac{d^2(∆S_{mix})}{dX_A^2} = \frac{d(-R \cdot (\frac{1}{X_A} - \frac{1}{1-X_A}))}{dX_A}$

Using the chain rule and quotient rule:

$\frac{d^2(∆S_{mix})}{dX_A^2} = -R \cdot (-\frac{1}{X_A^2} - \frac{1}{(1-X_A)^2})$

Now, let's plug in $X_A = \frac{1}{2}$:

$\frac{d^2(∆S_{mix})}{dX_A^2}\bigg|_{X_A=\frac{1}{2}} = -R \cdot (-\frac{1}{(\frac{1}{2})^2} - \frac{1}{(\frac{1}{2})^2})$

$\frac{d^2(∆S_{mix})}{dX_A^2}\bigg|_{X_A=\frac{1}{2}} = -R \cdot (-\frac{1}{\frac{1}{4}} - \frac{1}{\frac{1}{4}})$

$\frac{d^2(∆S_{mix})}{dX_A^2}\bigg|_{X_A=\frac{1}{2}} = -R \cdot (-4 - 4)$

$\frac{d^2(∆S_{mix})}{dX_A^2}\bigg|_{X_A=\frac{1}{2}} = 8R$

Since the second derivative is positive, the entropy is indeed maximum when $X_A = \frac{1}{2}$.

Therefore, the configurational entropy due to ideal mixing in a binary A-B system is maximum when:

$[X_A] = [\frac{1}{2}]$
