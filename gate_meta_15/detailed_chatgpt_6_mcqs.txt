The figure is not given, but based on the information provided, the correct answer can be deduced. 

Since the question states that in froth flotation, hydrophobic minerals (i.e. minerals which repel water) will ascend with air bubbles, it can be assumed that either mineral P or mineral Q is hydrophobic. 

Now, if the water droplet placed on the surface of mineral P wets the surface completely (i.e. spreads out and fully covers the surface), then mineral P is hydrophilic and will not ascend with the air bubbles. On the other hand, if the water droplet placed on the surface of mineral Q forms a high contact angle with the surface (i.e. does not spread out, but instead forms a droplet with a curved surface), then mineral Q is hydrophobic and will ascend with the air bubbles.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Mineral Q ascends with air bubbles preferentially over mineral P.
