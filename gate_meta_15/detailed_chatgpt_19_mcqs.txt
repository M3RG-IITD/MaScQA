To determine which manufacturing process is not used for producing fine-grained metals, we need to understand what each process entails:

(A) Electrodeposition: involves depositing metal ions onto a substrate using an electric current. This process can be used to produce thin films and coatings, but it is not typically used for producing bulk metals with fine grains.

(B) Czochralski method: a crystal growth technique used to produce single crystals of metals. This process is not typically used for producing fine-grained metals.

(C) Equi-Channel Angular Pressing (ECAP): a process used to refine the grain size of metals by repeatedly pressing and folding the metal. This process is commonly used for producing fine-grained metals.

(D) Sintering of milled powders: a process used to form solid shapes from powdered metals by heating the powder to a temperature below its melting point. This process can be used to produce fine-grained metals.

Therefore, the answer is (B) Czochralski method.
