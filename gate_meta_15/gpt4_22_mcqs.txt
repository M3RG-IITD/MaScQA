The stress required for Orowan dislocation bypass is inversely proportional to the interprecipitate spacing. That is,

stress1 * spacing1 = stress2 * spacing2

Let stress1 = 200 MPa, spacing1 = 500 nm, and spacing2 = 200 nm. We need to find stress2.

200 MPa * 500 nm = stress2 * 200 nm

stress2 = (200 MPa * 500 nm) / 200 nm

stress2 = (200 * 500) / 200

stress2 = 500 MPa

So, the stress required for Orowan dislocation bypass when the inter-precipitate spacing is reduced to 200 nm is 500 MPa.

Answer: [500]
