First, we need to use the formula for Gibbs free energy to calculate the equilibrium constant ($K$) at 1200 K:

$‚àÜùê∫¬∞ = ‚àíRT\ln{K}$

$-8000 = -8.314 \times 1200 \ln{K}$

$\ln{K} = \frac{-8000}{-8.314 \times 1200}$

$K = e^{\frac{-8000}{-8.314 \times 1200}} = 3.46$

Next, we can use the equilibrium constant to calculate the equilibrium ratio of $\frac{p_{CO_2}}{p_{CO}}$:

$K = \frac{p_{FeO}^3 p_{CO_2}}{p_{Fe_3O_4} p_{CO}}$

Since the reaction starts with pure $Fe_3O_4$ and pure $CO$, we can assume that the initial pressures of $Fe_3O_4$ and $FeO$ are negligible compared to the partial pressure of $CO$ and $CO_2$.

Therefore, we can simplify the equation to:

$K = \frac{p_{CO_2}}{p_{CO}}$

Plugging in the value of $K$, we get:

$\frac{p_{CO_2}}{p_{CO}} = 3.46$

Thus, the equilibrium ratio of $\frac{p_{CO_2}}{p_{CO}}$ is 3.46. 

Answer: 

- 3.46
