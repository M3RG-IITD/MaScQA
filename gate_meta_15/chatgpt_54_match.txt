The correct answer is:

(C) P-2, Q-4, R-1, S-3

Explanation:

- Creep resistance is improved by a fine grained two-phase microstructure, which can impede the movement of dislocations and grain-boundary sliding.
- Elastic modulus enhancement is achieved by coherent precipitates, which can act as barriers to dislocation motion and improve the homogeneity of the microstructure.
- Superplasticity is favored by a single crystal microstructure, which can allow for a high degree of deformation without fracturing, due to the absence of grain boundaries.
- Increased strength can be obtained with glass fibers in epoxy, which form a composite structure and can resist tensile and compressive stresses.
