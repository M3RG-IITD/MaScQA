Given:

Atomic weight of Fe = 56 g/mol

Atomic weight of $Fe_{2}O_{3}$ = 160 g/mol

Percentage of Fe in hot metal = 95%

Percentage of $Fe_{2}O_{3}$ in iron ore = 95%

Let the amount of iron ore required be x kg.

As per the question, all the iron in the ore goes to hot metal i.e.,

mass of Fe in iron ore = mass of Fe in hot metal

Now, let's calculate the mass of Fe in 1000 kg of hot metal.

Mass of hot metal = 1000 kg

Percentage of Fe in hot metal = 95%

Therefore, mass of Fe in hot metal = (95/100) x 1000 kg = 950 kg

We know that the hot metal is obtained by the reduction of $Fe_{2}O_{3}$ in iron ore.

The molecular weight of $Fe_{2}O_{3}$ = (2 x atomic weight of Fe) + (3 x atomic weight of oxygen)

= (2 x 56) + (3 x 16)

= 112 + 48

= 160 g/mol

Hence, one mole of $Fe_{2}O_{3}$ gives 2 moles of Fe.

So, the mass of Fe in $Fe_{2}O_{3}$ = (2 x atomic weight of Fe) = 2 x 56 = 112 g

Now, let's calculate the mass of iron ore required to get 1 kg of hot metal.

Mass of $Fe_{2}O_{3}$ required to get 2 moles of Fe = atomic weight of $Fe_{2}O_{3}$ = 160 g

Mass of $Fe_{2}O_{3}$ required to get 1 mole of Fe = (160/2) g = 80 g

Mass of $Fe_{2}O_{3}$ required to get 56 g of Fe = (80/2) g = 40 g

Therefore, 40 g of $Fe_{2}O_{3}$ gives 56 g of Fe.

Now, let's calculate the mass of iron ore required to get 950 kg of Fe.

Mass of iron ore required = (Mass of $Fe_{2}O_{3}$ required to get 56 g of Fe) x (Number of times 56 g of Fe is present in 950 kg)

= (40 g) x (950000 g/56 g)

= 678571.43 g

= 678.57 kg (approx.)

Therefore, the amount of iron ore required to produce 1000 kg of hot metal is approximately 678.57 kg.

Answer: [678.57 kg]
