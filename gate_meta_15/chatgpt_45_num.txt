Volume of the billet before forging = Volume of the pancake after forging.

Volume of billet = πr1^2h1, where r1 = radius of the billet and h1 = height of the billet.

Volume of pancake = πr2^2h2, where r2 = radius of the pancake and h2 = height of the pancake.

As the material is conserved, the volume of the billet before forging equals the volume of the pancake after forging.

πr1^2h1 = πr2^2h2

We are given h1 = 1.0 m and r1 = 0.25 m (diameter = 0.5 m)

We need to find r2 when h2 is given as 0.25 m.

π(0.25)^2(1.0) = πr2^2(0.25)

r2 = 0.5 m

Therefore, the diameter of the pancake is 1.0 m.

Answer: [1.0]
