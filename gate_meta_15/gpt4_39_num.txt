Let's denote the melting temperature as Tm (1356 K), the first undercooled temperature as T1 (1256 K), and the second undercooled temperature as T2 (1200 K).

We are given the free energy change for solidification at T1, ∆G^(L→S)_1 = -1000 J mol^(-1).

We need to find the free energy change for solidification at T2, ∆G^(L→S)_2.

According to the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation, we can find the relationship between free energy change and temperature:

∆H = -T (∂(∆G/T) / ∂T)

Where ∆H is the enthalpy change (latent heat of fusion) during the solidification process, which can be assumed to be constant in the temperature range we're considering.

Since ∆G = ∆H - T∆S (where ∆S is the entropy change), we can rewrite the equation as:

∆H = -T (∂(∆H/T - ∆S) / ∂T)

Let's integrate this equation within the temperature range from T1 to T2:

∫(d(∆G) = ∆H ∫(dT/T)

Integrating and evaluating the limits, we get:

∆G^(L→S)_2 - ∆G^(L→S)_1 = ∆H * (ln(T2) - ln(T1))

Now we can plug in the given values:

∆G^(L→S)_2 - (-1000 J/mol) = ∆H * (ln(1200) - ln(1256))

Let's find ∆H using the given melting point, Tm = 1356 K:

∆G^(L→S)_m = 0 (since free energy change at the melting point is zero)

0 = ∆H * (ln(1356) - ln(1256))

∆H = -1000 J/mol

Now, plug in ∆H into the previous equation:

∆G^(L→S)_2 - (-1000 J/mol) = -1000 J/mol * (ln(1200) - ln(1256))

∆G^(L→S)_2 = 1000 J/mol - 1000 J/mol * (ln(1200) - ln(1256))

∆G^(L→S)_2 ≈ -816.917 J/mol

Therefore, the free energy change for solidification at 1200 K is approximately -816.917 J mol^(-1).

Answer: [-816.917]
