Unfortunately, we cannot provide a detailed explanation to this question as it requires a reference image with plots labeled A, B, C, D, and S. 

However, we can provide you an overview of how Gibbs free energy (G) depends on temperature (T) for a single component system, and you can try to match this behavior with the given plots:

For a single component system, the Gibbs free energy (G) is related to the temperature (T) through the following equation:

ΔG = ΔH – TΔS

where ΔH is the enthalpy change, and ΔS is the entropy change.

1. In the solid phase, the molecules are tightly packed, and as the temperature increases, the entropy increases (particles have more freedom), and the enthalpy is relatively stable. Thus, the Gibbs free energy should decrease with increasing temperature in the solid phase.

2. At the melting point, solid starts to convert into liquid. The enthalpy change increases due to the heat absorbed during this process, but the entropy change is more significant because of the increased freedom of the liquid state. Hence, the Gibbs free energy will generally continue to decrease with increasing temperature in the liquid phase.

3. At the boiling point, liquid starts to convert into gas. Similar to the melting point, the enthalpy change increases, but the entropy change is dominant due to the gaseous state having more freedom compared to the liquid state. Thus, the Gibbs free energy will typically decrease even more with increasing temperature in the gas phase.

In conclusion, when selecting the correct plot of Gibbs free energy (G) vs. temperature (T) for a single component system, look for a graph that shows a decreasing Gibbs free energy as the temperature increases, considering phase transitions (solid, liquid, gas) as well.
