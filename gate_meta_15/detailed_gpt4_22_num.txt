To solve this problem, we can use the Orowan equation, which relates the stress required for Orowan dislocation bypass to the interprecipitate spacing. The Orowan equation is given by:

σ = Gb/L

Where:
σ is the stress required for Orowan dislocation bypass (in MPa),
G is the shear modulus of the material (in MPa),
b is the Burger's vector (in nm),
and L is the interprecipitate spacing (in nm).

We are given that the stress σ1 is 200 MPa when the interprecipitate spacing L1 is 500 nm. We can write this as:

σ1 = Gb/L1

We need to find the stress required (σ2) when the interprecipitate spacing L2 is reduced to 200 nm. We can write this as:

σ2 = Gb/L2

We can solve for the ratio of the stresses using the above equations to eliminate the unknown parameters G and b:

σ2/σ1 = (Gb/L2) / (Gb/L1)

The ratio of the stresses is:

σ2/σ1 = L1/L2

Now we can plug in the given values and solve for the stress σ2:

σ2/200 MPa = 500 nm / 200 nm

σ2 = (200 MPa) × (500 nm / 200 nm)

σ2 = 500 MPa

So, the stress required for Orowan dislocation bypass when the interprecipitate spacing is reduced to 200 nm is 500 MPa.

The answer is [500].
