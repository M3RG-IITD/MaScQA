To answer this question, let's first understand each metal forming technique mentioned in the options.

(A) Rolling: It is a process in which metal sheets are passed through a set of rollers which compresses and reduces the sheet's thickness. Although rolling can help in reducing the thickness, it cannot shape the object into a desired 3-D shape like that of a can.

(B) Forging: Forging is a process in which metal workpiece is deformed by applying compressive forces, usually using a hammer or a press. Forging is mostly used for products requiring high tensile strength or large deformation, but it is not suitable for creating hollow shapes like cans.

(C) Deep Drawing: Deep drawing is a sheet metal forming process in which a flat sheet of metal is formed into a hollow 3-D shape using a punch that pushes the sheet into a die cavity. This technique is extensively used for creating objects like cans, utensils, and similar products with a large axisymmetric depth-to-diameter ratio.

(D) Extrusion: Extrusion is a process in which a metal workpiece is forced through a die with a specific cross-sectional shape. This process is mainly used to create objects with continuous length and consistent cross-sectional profile, like rods, tubes, and rails. It is not suitable for the production of cans, which require a specific hollow shape.

Now, analyzing the given options, it can be concluded that the most suitable metal forming technique for producing soft drink cans from aluminum sheets is:

Answer: [C] Deep drawing
