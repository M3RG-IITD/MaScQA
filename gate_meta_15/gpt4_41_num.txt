To solve this problem, we can use the equation for diffusion times:

$$t_2 = t_1 \frac{D_1}{D_2}$$

Where $t_1$ is the time at the first temperature (1273 K), $D_1$ is the diffusivity at the first temperature, $t_2$ is the time at the second temperature (1373 K), and $D_2$ is the diffusivity at the second temperature.

We are given that $t_1 = 10\,\text{hours}$, $D_1 = 10^{-19}\,\text{m}^2\text{s}^{-1}$, and $D_2 = 10^{-18}\,\text{m}^2\text{s}^{-1}$. Plug in the values and solve for $t_2$:

$$t_2 = 10\,\text{hours} \cdot \frac{10^{-19}\,\text{m}^2\text{s}^{-1}}{10^{-18}\,\text{m}^2\text{s}^{-1}}$$

$$t_2 = 10\,\text{hours} \cdot \frac{1}{10}$$

$$t_2 = 1\,\text{hour}$$

So, the time required to achieve the same extent of homogenization at 1373 K is 1 hour. 

The answer is [1].
