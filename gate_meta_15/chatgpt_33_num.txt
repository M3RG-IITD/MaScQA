First, we need to calculate the percentage of iron in $Fe_2O_3$. Since the atomic weight of the iron in the compound is 2x56=112 g and that of the compound is 160 g, the percentage of iron in $Fe_2O_3$ is:

$$\frac{112}{160} \times 100 \% = 70\%$$

Since the iron ore contains 95% $Fe_2O_3$ and the rest is gangue, the percentage of iron in the ore is:

$$0.95 \times 70\% = 66.5\%$$

Therefore, to produce 1000 kg of hot metal containing 95% Fe, we need:

$$\frac{1000\text{ kg} \times 0.95 \times 100\%}{66.5\% \times 100\%} = 1422.56 \text{ kg}$$

So, we need 1422.56 kg of iron ore to produce 1000 kg of hot metal.

Answer: 

- 1422.56 kg
