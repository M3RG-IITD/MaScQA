Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We are given that the hot metal produced contains 95% Fe. We need to produce 1000 kg of hot metal. So, first, we will find out how much Fe is present in 1000 kg of hot metal.

2. Next, we are given that the iron ore charged into the furnace contains 95% $Fe_2O_3$. We will find out how much Fe is present in 1 mole of $Fe_2O_3$.

3. Then, we will determine how many moles of $Fe_2O_3$ are required to produce the required amount of Fe.

4. Finally, we will calculate the mass of iron ore required based on the moles we found in the previous step.

Step 1: Calculate the mass of Fe in 1000 kg of hot metal

Since the hot metal contains 95% Fe, the mass of Fe in 1000 kg of hot metal is:

mass of Fe = 1000 kg * 95% = 1000 kg * 0.95 = 950 kg

Step 2: Calculate the mass of Fe in 1 mole of $Fe_2O_3$

The atomic weight of Fe is 56 g $mol^{-1}$ and the molecular weight of $Fe_2O_3$ is 160 g $mol^{-1}$.
In the compound $Fe_2O_3$, there are two moles of Fe, so the mass of Fe in 1 mole of $Fe_2O_3$ is 2 * 56 g = 112 g.

Step 3: Calculate the moles of $Fe_2O_3$ required to produce the Fe in the hot metal

Since there are 112 g of Fe in 1 mole of $Fe_2O_3$, we can find the required moles of $Fe_2O_3$ as follows:

moles of $Fe_2O_3$ = (mass of Fe in hot metal) / (mass of Fe in 1 mole of $Fe_2O_3$)
moles of $Fe_2O_3$ = 950 kg / (112 g/mol * (1 kg/1000 g))
moles of $Fe_2O_3$ = 950 / (0.112)

Step 4: Calculate the mass of iron ore required

Since the iron ore contains 95% $Fe_2O_3$, we can find the mass of iron ore required:

mass of iron ore = (moles of $Fe_2O_3$ * molecular weight of $Fe_2O_3$) / 0.95
mass of iron ore = (950 / 0.112 * 160 g $mol^{-1}$ * (1 kg/1000g)) / 0.95

Now let's calculate the mass of iron ore required:

mass of iron ore = (950 / 0.112 * 160 / 1000) / 0.95
mass of iron ore â‰ˆ 1435 kg

So, approximately 1435 kg of iron ore is required to produce 1000 kg of hot metal.

The correct answer is [1435].
