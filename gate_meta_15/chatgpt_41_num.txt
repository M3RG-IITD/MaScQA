We can use the following relation between diffusivity and time required for homogenization:

$\frac{t_1}{t_2} = (\frac{D_1}{D_2})^2$

Where $t_1$ and $t_2$ are the times required for homogenization at temperatures $T_1$ and $T_2$ respectively, and $D_1$ and $D_2$ are their respective diffusivities.

Substituting the given values:

$\frac{t_{1273K}}{t_{1373K}} = (\frac{D_{1373K}}{D_{1273K}})^2$

$\frac{10}{t_{1373K}} = (\frac{10^{-18}}{10^{-19}})^2$

Simplifying:

$t_{1373K} = \frac{10}{10^{-4}} = 10^5$ hours

Therefore, the time required to achieve the same extent of homogenization at 1373 K is 100,000 hours.

Answer: 

- 100,000 hours
