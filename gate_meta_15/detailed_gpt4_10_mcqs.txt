To answer this question, we need to understand the concept behind the diffusion process and how the presence of lattice, grain boundaries, and free surfaces affect the rate of diffusion.

Diffusion is the movement of atoms or molecules from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration through different paths. In materials such as metals, there are three major paths of diffusion: through the lattice, along grain boundaries, and along free surfaces.

1. Lattice Diffusion ($D_L$): Lattice diffusion occurs within the crystal lattice structure where atoms move through the lattice, driven by the concentration gradient or temperature. This is the slowest process because atoms need to overcome the strong atomic bonding and move through dense lattice structures, which requires high energy. 

2. Grain Boundary Diffusion ($D_{GB}$): Grain boundary diffusion occurs along the borders between grains in a polycrystalline material. These boundaries have disordered atomic structures, which allows for diffusion with lower energy compared to lattice diffusion. This makes grain boundary diffusion faster than lattice diffusion, but slower than free surface diffusion.

3. Free Surface Diffusion (Surface Diffusion) ($D_S$): Free surface diffusion (or surface diffusion) occurs along the open surfaces, interfaces, or edges of the material where atoms are not constrained by surrounding atoms. Since atoms on the surface have fewer neighboring atoms and weaker bonding, they can move easily and quickly, making surface diffusion the fastest among the three types.

Based on this comparison, we can say:

$$D_S > D_{GB} > D_L$$

So, the correct answer is (D) $D_S > D_{GB} > D_L$.

To summarize the steps and comparison:

1. Lattice diffusion (${D_L}$) is slow because it requires significant energy to move through the dense lattice due to strong atomic bonding.
2. Grain boundary diffusion (${D_{GB}}$) is faster than lattice diffusion because the disorder in atomic structure provides lower energy paths for diffusion.
3. Free surface diffusion (${D_S}$) is the fastest among the three types because the weak bonding and fewer neighboring atoms on the surface provide easy movement.
