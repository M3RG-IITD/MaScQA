Let's analyze each process in Column I and find the most appropriate mechanism from Column II:

(P) Blast furnace iron making process:
This process involves the reduction of iron ore with carbon in the presence of a flux (limestone) to produce pig iron. It is an example of carbothermic reduction.
Hence, P matches with 3.

(Q) Hall-Heroult's process:
This is an electrolytic process for extracting aluminum from aluminum oxide (alumina). The process takes place in a molten salt (cryolite) electrolyte. This is an example of fused salt electrolysis.
Hence, Q matches with 4.

(R) Basic oxygen furnace steel making process:
This process involves blowing oxygen through molten pig iron to remove impurities and produce steel. This process is an example of oxidation.
Hence, R matches with 2.

(S) Kroll's process:
This is a process used to produce titanium by reducing titanium tetrachloride with a more reactive metal, such as magnesium. This is an example of metallothermic reduction.
Hence, S matches with 1.

So, the correct matching is P-3, Q-4, R-2, and S-1. 
The correct answer is therefore option (C) [P-3, Q-4, R-2, S-1].
