The angle of contact should be less than or equal to the angle of friction given by:
$$\theta \leq \tan^{-1}(\mu)$$
where $\mu$ is the coefficient of friction.

Substituting the given value of $\mu=0.1$, we get:
$$\theta \leq \tan^{-1}(0.1) \approx 5.7^\circ$$

Therefore, the angle of contact should be less than or equal to 5.7 degrees.

Answer: 
- 5.7 degrees.
