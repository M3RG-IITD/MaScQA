To match the materials from Column I with their applications in Column II, we need to understand the characteristics and properties of each material and their suitability for specific applications.

(P) Gray iron: Gray iron has excellent castability, wear resistance, and damping capacity. It is widely used for casting applications and is commonly used as the base structure of heavy machines. Therefore, P matches with 2.

(Q) Ductile iron: Ductile iron has high strength, ductility, and excellent resistance to wear and fatigue. It is commonly used for valve and pump bodies, as well as in the automotive and pipe industries. Therefore, Q matches with 3.

(R) Zirconium alloy: Zirconium alloys have excellent corrosion resistance, low neutron absorption cross-section, and high temperature resistance, which makes them suitable as cladding for uranium fuel in nuclear reactors. Therefore, R matches with 1.

(S) Beryllium-Copper alloy: Beryllium-copper alloys have high strength, good electrical and thermal conductivity, and excellent resistance to wear and fatigue. They are widely used in high-stress, high-temperature applications, such as jet aircraft landing gear bearings. However, there is a slight numbering issue in the question. Jet aircraft landing gear bearings are not labeled with a number in Column II.

Considering the information above, we can create the following matches: P-2, Q-3, R-1, and S-(the correct number for jet aircraft landing gear bearings).

Since the options do not include a perfect match, we'll choose the closest one which is (D) P-2, Q-3, R-1, S-4, with the understanding that the number for jet aircraft landing gear bearings should be corrected.

Correct answer: [(D) P-2, Q-3, R-1, S-4] (with the understanding that the number for jet aircraft landing gear bearings should be corrected).
