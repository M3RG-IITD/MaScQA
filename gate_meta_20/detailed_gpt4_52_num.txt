Given that the crack growth rate (da/dN) is proportional to $(ΔK)^3$. Let's express this relationship as:

da/dN = C$(ΔK)^3$

Where C is a constant of proportionality, ΔK is the stress intensity range, and da/dN is the rate of crack growth.

Now, we are given that when the crack length (a) increases by a factor of 2, we need to find the factor by which the crack growth rate (da/dN) increases.

Let the initial values be represented by the subscript 1:

$ΔK_1 = ΔK$
$da/dN_1 = C(ΔK_1)^3 = C(ΔK)^3$

When the crack length (a) increases by a factor of 2, let's denote the new values with the subscript 2:

$ΔK_2 = 2ΔK$
$da/dN_2 = C(ΔK_2)^3 = C(2ΔK)^3$

Now we need to find the ratio of the new crack growth rate ($da/dN_2$) to the initial crack growth rate ($da/dN_1$) to determine the factor by which the crack growth rate increases:

$ΔR = \dfrac{da/dN_2}{da/dN_1}$

By substituting the expressions for $da/dN_1$ and $da/dN_2$ from above, we get:

$ΔR = \dfrac{C(2ΔK)^3}{C(ΔK)^3}$

The constant of proportionality (C) cancels out:

$ΔR = \dfrac{(2ΔK)^3}{(ΔK)^3}$

Now simplify by substituting $2ΔK$ for $ΔK_2$:

$ΔR = \dfrac{(2ΔK)^3}{(ΔK)^3} = (\dfrac{2ΔK}{ΔK})^3$

Simplify further:

$ΔR = (2)^3$

$ΔR = 8$

So when the crack length increases by a factor of 2, the crack growth rate increases by a factor of 8. Answer: [8]
