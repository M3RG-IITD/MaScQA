To solve this problem, we can use the fracture mechanics approach and apply the following equation:

$σ_{max} = \frac{K_{1c}}{Y \cdot a^{1/2}}$

Where:
- $σ_{max}$ is the maximum allowed tensile stress on the component (in MPa)
- $K_{1c}$ is the fracture toughness (in MPa·m^1/2)
- $Y$ is the crack geometry factor (dimensionless)
- $a$ is the crack length (in meters)

Given values:
- $K_{1c}= 30$ MPa·m^1/2
- Y = 1 (assuming crack geometry factor of unity)
- The Non-Destructive Test (NDT) can only detect cracks larger than 1mm. So, we'll consider the minimum detectable crack length for our calculation: $a = 0.001$ meters (1 mm in meters)

Now, let's calculate the maximum allowed tensile stress without keeping the margin of safety yet:

$σ_{max} = \frac{K_{1c}}{Y \cdot a^{1/2}}$

$σ_{max} = \frac{30}{1 \cdot (0.001)^{1/2}}$

$σ_{max} = \frac{30}{0.03162} \approx 948.67$ MPa

Now, let's keep a 10% margin of safety. To do this, we'll reduce the stress by 10%:
 
$σ_{allowed} = σ_{max} \cdot (1 - Margin\; of\; Safety)$

$σ_{allowed} = 948.67 \cdot (1 - 0.1)$

$σ_{allowed} = 948.67 \cdot 0.9 \approx 853.8$ MPa  

Finally, rounding off to the nearest integer, we get: 

$σ_{allowed} \approx 854$ MPa

So, the maximum allowed tensile stress on the component, keeping a 10% margin of safety, is approximately 854 MPa.
