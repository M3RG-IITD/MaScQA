In order to match the elements in Column I with their electronic behavior in Column II, we will first understand the electronic behavior of each type.

1. Ferromagnetic materials are those that can be magnetized and have a strong response to a magnetic field. The common examples are iron, nickel, and cobalt.
2. Superconducting materials can conduct electricity without resistance when they are cooled below a certain temperature. Examples include elements such as mercury and some alloys.
3. Semiconducting materials have electrical conductivity between that of a metal and an insulator. Classic examples include elements like silicon and germanium.
4. Diamagnetic materials are those that create an induced magnetic field in the opposite direction when they are subjected to an external magnetic field. Examples include copper, gold, and silver.

Now, let's match the elements in Column I with their electronic behaviors:

- (P) Copper: Copper is a diamagnetic element. Thus, P matches with 4.
- (Q) Iron: Iron is a ferromagnetic element. Thus, Q matches with 1.
- (R) Mercury: Mercury is a superconducting element (when cooled below a certain temperature). Thus, R matches with 2.
- (S) Silicon: Silicon is a semiconducting element. Thus, S matches with 3.

So, the correct matches are P-4, Q-1, R-2, S-3. Therefore, the answer is (C).

Thus, the list with the correct answer is [C].
