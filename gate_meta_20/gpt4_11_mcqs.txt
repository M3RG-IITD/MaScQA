Given that the solid spheres X and Y are of identical diameter, they have the same geometry. To determine the time required for the center of sphere Y to reach 800K, we need the ratio of the two thermal diffusivities and the given time for sphere X.

The ratio of the thermal diffusivities of sphere X to sphere Y is:

100 * 10^(-6) / 25 * 10^(-6) = 4

According to the property of heat conduction for solid spheres of identical geometry, the time required for the centers to reach the same temperature is inversely proportional to the square of the ratio of their thermal diffusivities.

Let t be the time required for the center of sphere Y to reach 800K.

t = 1 * (4)^2
t = 1 * 16
t = 16 hours

So the correct answer is (D) 16 hours.
