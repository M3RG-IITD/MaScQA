To solve this problem, we'll first find the velocity at which the liquid metal enters the mold cavity. We can use the following formula for free fall:

v^2 = u^2 + 2as

where v is the final velocity, u is the initial velocity, a is the acceleration due to gravity, and s is the height from which the liquid is falling. In this case, u = 0, a = 9.8 $m/s^2$, and s = 0.5 m.

v^2 = 0 + 2 * 9.8 * 0.5
v^2 = 9.8
v = sqrt(9.8)
v ≈ 3.13 $m/s$

Now, we can find the flow rate, which is the volume of liquid flowing into the mold per unit time (Q = A * v). In this case, A is the cross-sectional area of the gate (0.2 $m^2$), and v is the velocity of the stream (3.13 $m/s$).

Q = 0.2 * 3.13
Q ≈ 0.626 $m^3/s$

Finally, we need to find the time required to fill the mold. The mold has a volume of 10 $m^3$, so we can find the required time by dividing the mold volume by the flow rate:

t = V / Q
t = 10 / 0.626
t ≈ 15.97 seconds

Rounding off to the nearest integer, the time required to fill the mold is approximately 16 seconds.

The answer is [16].
