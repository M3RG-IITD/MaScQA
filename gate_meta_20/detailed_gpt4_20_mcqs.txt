To solve this question, we first need to understand what cold working and recrystallization are, and how they affect the properties of metals.

Cold working or cold forming is the process of plastically deforming a metal below its recrystallization temperature, typically at room temperature. This process introduces a large number of dislocations and vacancies into the metal's crystal structure, which leads to the following consequences:

1. The metal becomes harder and stronger due to the increased density of dislocations, which impede the movement of other dislocations.
2. The ductility of the metal decreases because of the increased dislocation density and reduced atom mobility.
3. The stored energy in the metal increases due to the presence of dislocations and vacancies, which create internal stress in the crystal structure.

Recrystallization is a process that occurs when a cold-worked metal is heated to a temperature below its melting point but above its recrystallization temperature. During recrystallization, the crystal structure rearranges itself, removing the dislocations and vacancies introduced during cold working. This process results in the formation of new, strain-free grains, which have a lower density of dislocations.

Now let's evaluate each of the statements given in the question:

(A) A heavily cold-worked metal will yield a coarser recrystallized grain size.

The grain size of a recrystallized metal depends on the balance between nucleation and grain growth. A heavily cold-worked metal will have a high driving force for recrystallization due to the large amount of stored energy. This high driving force favors the nucleation of new grains, which means that more grain boundaries will form, and the final grain size will be finer (smaller) rather than coarser (larger).

(B) A heavily cold-worked metal will possess a lower driving force for recrystallization.

This statement is incorrect because, as mentioned earlier, a heavily cold-worked metal will have a high driving force for recrystallization. The stored energy in the metal, created by the dislocation density and vacancies, creates a driving force for recrystallization to reduce the internal stress and energy.

(C) A heavily cold-worked metal will have a higher energy barrier for nucleation of recrystallized grains.

This statement is incorrect because the energy barrier for nucleation decreases with increasing stored energy. A heavily cold-worked metal will have a high stored energy, which facilitates the nucleation of new, strain-free grains. Therefore, the energy barrier for nucleation will be lower, not higher.

(D) A heavily cold-worked metal will recrystallize at lower temperatures.

This statement is correct. A heavily cold-worked metal has a lot of stored energy, which promotes recrystallization. As a result, the recrystallization temperature decreases. A lower recrystallization temperature implies that the metal will recrystallize at a lower temperature compared to a less cold-worked metal, given it has enough time to go through the recrystallization process.

So, the correct answer is:

[D]
