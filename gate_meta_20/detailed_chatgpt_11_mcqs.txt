We can use the formula for thermal diffusivity, which relates the rate of change of temperature to the rate of heat flow through a material:

$$\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \alpha \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2}$$

where $T$ is the temperature, $t$ is time, $x$ is distance from the center, and $\alpha$ is the thermal diffusivity.

Since both spheres have identical diameters, we can assume that the temperature distribution is symmetrical about the center, and so we can simplify the equation to:

$$\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \alpha \frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(r^2\frac{\partial T}{\partial r}\right)$$

where $r$ is the distance from the center.

We can separate the variables by assuming that $T$ can be written as a product of functions of $t$ and $r$:

$$T(t,r) = f(t)g(r)$$

Substituting this into the equation, we get:

$$\frac{1}{\alpha f}\frac{df}{dt} = \frac{1}{r^2g}\frac{d}{dr}\left(r^2\frac{d g}{dr}\right)$$

Since the left-hand side of the equation depends only on $t$, and the right-hand side depends only on $r$, they must be equal to a constant, which we will call $-\lambda^2$. This gives two separate differential equations:

$$\frac{df}{dt} = -\lambda^2\alpha f$$

and

$$\frac{d}{dr}\left(r^2\frac{d g}{dr}\right) + \lambda^2 r^2 g = 0$$

The first equation is a simple exponential decay with a time constant of $\alpha/\lambda^2$. The second equation is the Bessel equation, which has solutions of the form:

$$g(r) = A J_0(\lambda r) + B Y_0(\lambda r)$$

where $J_0$ and $Y_0$ are the Bessel functions of the first and second kind, respectively. Since the temperature at the center of the sphere must remain finite, we have $g(0) = A$. Since the temperature at the surface of the sphere must also remain finite, we have $g(d/2) = 0$, where $d$ is the diameter of the sphere. This gives us the boundary conditions:

$$g(0) = A = \text{finite}$$

and

$$J_0(\lambda\frac{d}{2}) + B Y_0(\lambda\frac{d}{2}) = 0$$

The equation for $f(t)$ gives us the time constant:

$$\alpha/\lambda^2$$

We can use the given information about sphere X to find $\lambda$ and hence the time constant:

$$\frac{800-1000}{1\text{ hour}} = \alpha\frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(r^2\frac{\partial T}{\partial r}\right)$$

Using the simplification that $T(t,r) = f(t)g(r)$, we can rewrite this equation as:

$$\frac{800-1000}{1\text{ hour}} = \frac{\alpha}{r^2}\frac{d}{dr}\left(r^2\frac{d g}{dr}\right)$$

At the center of the sphere, $g'(0) = 0$ (since the temperature gradient must be zero at $r=0$, which is the axis of symmetry). This means that the Bessel function reduces to $J_0(\lambda r)$, and the boundary condition at the surface is $J_0(\lambda d/2) = 0$.

The first zero of $J_0(x)$ is approximately 2.405, so we can use this to find $\lambda$:

$$J_0(\lambda\frac{d}{2}) = 0 \Rightarrow \lambda \approx \frac{2.405}{d/2}$$

Plugging this value of $\lambda$ into the time constant equation, we get:

$$\text{time constant} = \frac{\alpha}{\lambda^2} \approx 80 \text{ hours}$$

Finally, we can use this time constant to find the time required for sphere Y to reach 800K:

$$f(t) = e^{-t/\text{time constant}}$$

We want to find the time $t$ at which $f(t) = 800/1000 = 0.8$:

$$0.8 = e^{-t/80}$$

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get:

$$\ln 0.8 = -\frac{t}{80}$$

Solving for $t$, we get:

$$t \approx 16 \text{ hours}$$

Therefore, the answer is (D) 16 hours.
