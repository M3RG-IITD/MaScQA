Given: $[C]_(1 wt.% Henrian Std. State)$ + $[O]_(1 wt.% Henrian Std. State)$ → $(CO)_(1 atm. Std. State)$. ΔG° = -19840 -40.65 T J. R = 8.314 $J.mol^(-1).K^(-1)$. Assume: 1. Equilibrium between dissolved carbon [C], dissolved oxygen [O], and CO (gas) at 1 atmpshere. 2.Henry's law is valid for both [C] and [O]. A basic oxygen furnace operator, at the end of oxygen blow, measures the dissolved oxygen content in the steel as 0.03 wt.% and the steel temperature as 1800K. The carbon content [C] in the steel is?(round off to two decimal places)
