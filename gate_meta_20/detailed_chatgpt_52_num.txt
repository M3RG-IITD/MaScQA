We are given that da/dN ∝ $(ΔK)^(3)$, where, a is the crack length and N is the number of cycles. This can be written as:

da/dN = C * $(ΔK)^(3)$

where C is a constant of proportionality.

Now, when the crack length doubles, we can assume that the stress intensity range ΔK remains constant (since the mean stress is given to be zero). Therefore, we can write:

da/dN = C * $(ΔK)^(3)$ = C * (2ΔK)^(3) = 8C * $(ΔK)^(3)$

So, the crack growth rate will increase by a factor of 8 when the crack length doubles.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

- 8
