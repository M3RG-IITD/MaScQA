To find the driving force for liquid copper to transform to solid, we can use the following formula for the change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) during a phase change:

ΔG = ΔH - TΔS

Where ΔH is the enthalpy of melting, T is the temperature, and ΔS is the entropy change during the melting process. Since the process is the reverse of melting (i.e., solidifying), we can write the formula as:

ΔG = -ΔH + TΔS

First, we need to find the entropy change during melting (ΔS). We can use the formula:

ΔS = ΔH / Tm

Where Tm is the melting temperature. Plugging in the values for copper:

ΔS = (13 * 10^3) / 1356
ΔS ≈ 9.587 J.K^(-1).mol^(-1)

Next, substitute the values of ΔH, T, and ΔS into the formula for ΔG:

ΔG = -(13 * 10^3) + (1353 * 9.587)
ΔG ≈ -13000 + 12978.13
ΔG ≈ -21.87 J.mol^(-1)

The magnitude of the driving force is the absolute value of ΔG:

|ΔG| ≈ 21.9 J.mol^(-1) (rounded to one decimal place)

So the correct answer is [21.9].
