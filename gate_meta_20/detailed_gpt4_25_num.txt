To find the number of atoms per unit area in the (100) plane of Pb, we first need to determine the lattice parameter (a) for the FCC structure.

Step 1: Determining lattice parameter (a)
The atomic radius (r) of Pb is given as 0.175 nm. In an FCC structure, the lattice parameter (a) can be calculated using the following formula:

a = 2√2 * r

Substitute the given value of r:

a = 2√2 * 0.175
a ≈ 0.494 nm

Step 2: Calculate the area of the (100) plane
For the (100) plane, the area can be calculated as a square with side length equal to the lattice parameter (a):

Area = a²
Area ≈ (0.494 nm)²
Area ≈ 0.244 nm²

Step 3: Calculate the number of atoms in the (100) plane of the unit cell
In an FCC structure, each corner atom is shared by 8 adjacent unit cells, and each face-centered atom is shared by 2 adjacent unit cells. In the (100) plane of Pb, there are 4 corner atoms and no face-centered atoms. Therefore, each unit cell contributes:

(4 corner atoms × 1/8) + (0 face-centered atoms × 1/2) = 4/8 = 1/2

So, each (100) plane in the FCC structure contains half an atom per unit cell.

Step 4: Calculate the number of atoms per unit area
Now we can calculate the number of atoms per unit area in the (100) plane of Pb by dividing the number of atoms per unit cell by the area of the unit cell:

Number of atoms per unit area = (1/2) / 0.244 nm²
Number of atoms per unit area ≈ 2.05 atoms/nm²

Rounding off to the nearest integer, we get:

Number of atoms per unit area ≈ 2 atoms/nm²

So, the number of atoms per unit area in the (100) plane of Pb is approximately 2 atoms/nm².
