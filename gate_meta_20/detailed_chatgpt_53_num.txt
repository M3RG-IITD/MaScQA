We can use Bernoulli's equation to solve this problem. Bernoulli's equation states that the sum of the pressure, kinetic energy, and potential energy per unit volume of a fluid is constant along a streamline. In this problem, we can assume that the streamline is vertical, and therefore the velocity of the fluid at the surface of the liquid pool in the mold is zero. We can write the equation as follows:

$P_1 + \frac{1}{2}\rho v_1^2 + \rho g h_1 = P_2 + \frac{1}{2}\rho v_2^2 + \rho g h_2$

where $P_1$ and $P_2$ are the pressures at the surface of the liquid pool in the mold and at the top of the stream, respectively, $\rho$ is the density of the fluid, $v_1$ and $v_2$ are the velocities at these two points, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $h_1$ is the depth of the liquid pool in the mold, and $h_2$ is the height of the stream above the liquid pool. 

Since the velocity at the surface of the liquid pool is zero, we can simplify the equation to:

$P_1 + \rho g h_1 = P_2 + \frac{1}{2}\rho v_2^2 + \rho g h_2$

We can assume that the pressure at the top of the stream is atmospheric pressure, and therefore $P_2 = P_{atm}$. We can also assume that the velocity of the stream at the top is very close to its terminal velocity, which can be calculated using the equation:

$v_t = \sqrt{\frac{2mg}{\rho A C_d}}$

where $m$ is the mass flow rate, $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the stream, and $C_d$ is the discharge coefficient. In this problem, we can assume that $C_d = 1$, since we are ignoring any fluid friction and drag effects. Therefore, we can write:

$v_t = \sqrt{\frac{2gh_2}{C_d}}$

We know that the volume of the mold cavity is 10 $m^3$, and therefore the mass of the liquid metal that needs to be poured into the mold is:

$m = \rho V = \rho A h_1$

We can combine all of these equations to solve for the time it takes to fill the mold:

$t = \frac{m}{\dot{m}} = \frac{\rho A h_1}{\dot{m}}$

where $\dot{m}$ is the mass flow rate, which can be calculated using the equation:

$\dot{m} = A v_2 \rho$

We can substitute the expressions for $v_t$ and $h_2$ into this equation, and simplify to get:

$\dot{m} = \frac{C_d A}{\sqrt{2gh_2}}\sqrt{\frac{\rho g A h_2}{2}}\rho$

We can substitute this expression for $\dot{m}$ into the expression for $t$, and simplify to get:

$t = \frac{h_1}{C_d}\sqrt{\frac{2h_2}{g}}$

We know that $h_1 + h_2 = 0.5$ m, and therefore we can write:

$h_1 = 0.5 - h_2$

We can substitute this expression for $h_1$ into the expression for $t$, and simplify to get:

$t = \frac{0.5 - h_2}{C_d}\sqrt{\frac{2h_2}{g}}$

Now we can find the value of $h_2$ that minimizes $t$ using calculus. We can calculate the derivative of $t$ with respect to $h_2$ and set it equal to zero:

$\frac{dt}{dh_2} = \frac{1}{C_d}\sqrt{\frac{h_2}{2g}} - \frac{0.5 - h_2}{2C_d}\sqrt{\frac{2}{gh_2}} = 0$

Solving for $h_2$, we get:

$h_2 = \frac{1}{3}$ m

Finally, we can substitute this value of $h_2$ into the expression for $t$, and round off to the nearest integer to get the answer:

$t \approx 11$ seconds
