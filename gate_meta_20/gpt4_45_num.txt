To calculate the Ni content in the weld pool, we need to first determine the weight percentage of Ni in each of the original plates and the filler rod. Then, we can average these values by taking into account their contributions to the dilution (20% each for plates and 60% for the filler rod).

Let's start with the Fe-10 wt.% Ni plate:
Ni content in this plate = 10 wt.% 

Now let's look at the Fe-20 wt.% Cr-5 wt.% Ni plate:
Ni content in this plate = 5 wt.%

Finally, the filler rod has 20 wt.% Ni-80 wt.% Cr composition:
Ni content in the filler rod = 20 wt.%

To find the average Ni content in the weld pool considering their contribution to dilution:

Ni content in the weld pool = (10 wt.% * 20% + 5 wt.% * 20% + 20 wt.% * 60%)
Ni content in the weld pool = (0.2 * 10 + 0.2 * 5 + 0.6 * 20)
Ni content in the weld pool = (2 + 1 + 12)

Ni content in the weld pool = 15 wt.%

So, the Ni content in the weld pool is approximately 15 wt.% (rounded off to the nearest integer).

The answer is [15].
