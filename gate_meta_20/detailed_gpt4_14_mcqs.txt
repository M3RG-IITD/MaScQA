To find the angle between two neighboring tetrahedral bonds in silicon having a diamond cubic structure, we need to first know the arrangement of atoms in this structure and then use geometrical concepts to determine the angle.

Step 1: Understanding the diamond cubic structure

The diamond cubic structure is a type of crystalline lattice formed by repeating a pattern of 8 face-centered cubic (fcc) unit cells. In the diamond cubic structure, each silicon atom is covalently bonded to four neighboring silicon atoms, forming a tetrahedron. Each unit cell contains 8 tetrahedral sites, with each site hosting a silicon atom.

Step 2: Finding the angle between two neighboring tetrahedral bonds

Given a tetrahedron with four silicon atoms, we will determine the angle formed between two bonds originating from a single atom. 

Consider one of the silicon atoms as the center of the tetrahedron. Label it A. Now label the other three silicon atoms as B, C, and D. We want to find the angle formed between bonds AB and AC. 

First, let's calculate the edge length of the tetrahedron, which is the distance between any two neighboring silicon atoms. Since the diamond cubic structure has the edge length (a) for one unit cell, the face diagonal of the diamond cubic unit cell would be √2 * a.

But the bond lengths AB and AC in a diamond cubic structure are half of that face diagonal. Therefore, the edge length (L) of the tetrahedron is:

L = 1/2 * √2 * a

Now, let's first find the distance between B and C. This is equal to the distance between their images on an adjacent diamond cubic unit cell. The face diagonal of the cubic unit cell is √2 * a, and the tetrahedron edge length is half of that (L).

So, the distance between atoms B and C, (BC) is:

BC = 2 * L = √2 * a

Since all bond lengths and the distance between the atoms B and C are known, we can use the law of cosines to find the angle θ between the bonds AB and AC. The law of cosines states:

BC^2 = AB^2 + AC^2 - 2(AB)(AC)cos(θ)

Substitute known values:

(√2 * a)^2 = (1/2 * √2 * a)^2 + (1/2 * √2 * a)^2 - 2(1/2 * √2 * a)(1/2 * √2 * a)cos(θ)

2a^2 = 1/2a^2 + 1/2a^2 - a^2cos(θ)

Rearrange the equation to find cos(θ):

cos(θ) = (2a^2 - 1/2a^2 - 1/2a^2) / a^2

cos(θ) = (1/2)

Now, to find the angle θ, take the inverse cosine:

θ = cos^(-1)(1/2)

θ ≈ 109.47°

Now, rounding off the angle to one decimal place, we find:

θ ≈ 109.5°

Hence, the angle between two neighboring tetrahedral bonds in silicon having a diamond cubic structure is approximately 109.5°, which is the correct answer.

Answer: [109.5°]
