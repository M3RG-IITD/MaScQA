Given: 1. Avogadro number is 6.02 * $10^(23)$. 2. Density of Si is 2.33 * $g.cm^(-3)$. 3. Atomic weight of P is 30.97. 4. Charge of electron is 1.6 * $10^(-19)A.s$ 5. Mobility of electron is 0.2 $m^(2).V^(-1).s^(-1)$. Zone refining of Si results in residual P content of 0.1 parts per billion by weight. The electrical conductivity($Î©^(-1).m^(-1)$) of this Zone refined Si is?(round off to two decimal places).
