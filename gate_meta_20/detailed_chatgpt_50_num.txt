First, we need to calculate the number of P atoms present in the Zone refined Si using the given weight percentage. 

1 part per billion = 1/1,000,000,000 = 1 * $10^(-9)$

Weight of P in 1 gram of Si = (0.1 * $10^(-9)$) * 1 gram = 1 * $10^(-10)$ grams 

Number of P atoms in 1 gram of Si = (1 * $10^(-10)$)/30.97 * Avogadro number = 5.03 * $10^(12)$ atoms 

Now, we can calculate the electrical conductivity using the formula: 

Electrical conductivity = (n * q * $\mu$) / density 

Where, 
n = number of electrons per unit volume 
q = charge of electron 
$\mu$ = mobility of electron 
density = density of Si 

n = (1 / (8 * $10^(22)$)) * Avogadro number = 7.53 * $10^18$ electrons/m^3 (assuming Si is an intrinsic semiconductor) 

Substituting the given values, 

Electrical conductivity = (7.53 * $10^18$ * 1.6 * $10^(-19)$ * 0.2) / 2.33 = 1.03 * $10^2$ $Ω^(-1).m^(-1)$ 

Therefore, the electrical conductivity of the Zone refined Si is 103.00 $Ω^(-1).m^(-1)$ (rounded off to two decimal places). 

Answer: [103.00]
