The correct answer is (A) GP zone → θ`` → θ` → θ. 

Explanation:
Al-4 wt% Cu alloy undergoes precipitation hardening or age hardening process. During the process, the alloy is heated to a certain temperature and held for a period of time to allow for the formation of precipitates. The precipitates strengthen the alloy by obstructing the movement of dislocations within the crystal structure.

The precipitation sequence in Al-4 wt% Cu alloy is as follows:

1. GP Zone (Guinier-Preston Zone): This is the initial stage of precipitation hardening, where small solute clusters form within the aluminum matrix. These clusters are known as GP zones and are not visible under an optical microscope.

2. θ`` (Theta double prime): θ`` is the next stage in precipitation hardening, where the GP zones transform into coherent θ`` precipitates. θ`` precipitates have a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure and are visible under an optical microscope.

3. θ` (Theta prime): With increasing aging time, the θ`` precipitates grow in size and coherency is lost. The θ`` precipitates then transform into θ` precipitates, which have an ordered FCC crystal structure. θ` precipitates are also visible under an optical microscope.

4. θ (Theta): As aging time increases further, the θ` precipitates grow in size and coarsen. The θ` precipitates eventually transform into θ precipitates, which have a disordered FCC crystal structure. θ precipitates are visible under an optical microscope.

Hence, the correct sequence of precipitation during aging of Al-4 wt% Cu alloy is GP zone → θ`` → θ` → θ.
