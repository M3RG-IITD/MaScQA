We will check each option to find the correct answer.

(A) To be mutually perpendicular, we need the dot product of XY, YZ, and XZ to be 0.
XY = (-1*-1) + (-1*2) + (1*1) = 1 - 2 + 1 = 0
YZ = (-1*1) + (2*0) + (1*1) = -1 + 0 + 1 = 0
XZ = (-1*1) + (-1*0) + (1*1) = -1 + 0 + 1 = 0
All of them are 0, so they are mutually perpendicular.

(B) If the volume of the scalar triple product (also called the box product) of the vectors (X, Y, Z) is zero, then they are coplanar.
Scalar triple product = |(X.Y)Z - (X.Z)Y| = |XY.Z - XZ.Y|
XY.Z = 0 (already calculated above)
XZ.Y = (-1*-1) + (-1*2) + (1*1) = 1 - 2 + 1 = 0
The scalar triple product is zero, so they are coplanar.

(C) Let N be the normal vector to the plane containing Y and Z. To find N, we need to do the cross product of Y and Z:
N = Y × Z = (-1i - 2j + k) × (i + k) = -3j + 2k
The angle between N and X can be obtained by the dot product rule:
cos(theta) = (Nx * Xx + Ny * Xy + Nz * Xz) / (|N| * |X|)
Nx, Ny, Nz = -3, 2, 1
Xx, Xy, Xz = -1, -1, 1
|N| = sqrt((-3)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(14)
|X| = sqrt((-1)^2 + (-1)^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(3)
cos(theta) = (-3*(-1) + 2*(-1) + 1*1) / (sqrt(14) * sqrt(3)) = 1/sqrt(42)
theta = arccos(1/sqrt(42))
Checking if the angle is 30°:
theta = 30° = pi/6, so cos(theta) = sqrt(3)/2.

1/sqrt(42) is not equal to sqrt(3)/2. So, the angle between N and X is not 30°.

(D) The angle between N and Z can be obtained by the dot product rule:
cos(theta) = (Nx * Zx + Ny * Zy + Nz * Zz) / (|N| * |Z|)
Zx, Zy, Zz = 1, 0, 1
|Z| = sqrt(1^2 + 0^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2)
cos(theta) = (-3*1 + 2*0 + 1*1) / (sqrt(14) * sqrt(2)) = -1/sqrt(28)
theta = arccos(-1/sqrt(28))
Checking if the angle is 60°:
theta = 60° = pi/3, so cos(theta) = 1/2.

-1/sqrt(28) is not equal to 1/2. So, the angle between N and Z is not 60°.

Based on the analysis above, option (A) X, Y, and Z are mutually perpendicular and option (B) X, Y, and Z are coplanar are both true. Therefore, the correct answer is [(A), (B)].
