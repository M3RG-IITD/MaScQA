To find the corrosion rate, we need to first convert the given values to the appropriate units and then apply the formula for corrosion rate. 

Given values:
Exposed surface area = 50 cm² 
Weight loss = 200 g 
Time = 10 years

Step 1: Convert the exposed surface area from cm² to m².
1 m² = 10,000 cm² (since 1 m = 100 cm and 1 m² = 100x100 cm²)
So, 50 cm² = 50/10,000 = 0.005 m².

Step 2: Convert the weight loss from grams to kilograms.
1 kg = 1,000 g.
So, 200 g = 200/1,000 = 0.2 kg.

Step 3: Use the formula for corrosion rate.
Corrosion rate (CR) = (weight loss) / (exposed surface area * time).

CR = (0.2 kg) / (0.005 m² * 10 years).
CR = 0.2 / 0.05.
CR = 4 kg.m^(-2).year^(-1).

So, the corrosion rate is approximately 4 kg.m².year^(-1).

The correct answer is [4].
