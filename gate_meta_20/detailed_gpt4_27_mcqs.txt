In a FCC (face-centered cubic) crystal, dislocation reactions are feasible if the following two conditions are met:

1. The Burger's vector is conserved in the reaction.
2. All the dislocations involved have the same smallest common integral denominator (SCID).

Let's evaluate each option:

(A) (1/2)[0 -1 1] → (1/6)[1 -2 1] + (1/6)[-1 -1 2]

To check the conservation of the Burger's vector, add the vectors on the right side and multiply them by their respective denominators:

(1/6)[1 -2 1] * 6 = [1 -2 1]
(1/6)[-1 -1 2] * 6 = [-1 -1 2]

Now add the resulting vectors:
[1 -2 1] + [-1 -1 2] = [0 -3 3]

The denominator of the left side is 2 while the right side has 6, so we need to make them equal by multiplying the left side by 3:
(3)(1/2)[0 -1 1] = [0 -3 3]

Now, the Burger's vector is conserved. However, the SCID on the left side is 2 and on the right side it is 6. The SCID is not the same, so this reaction is NOT feasible.

(B) (1/2)[1 -1 0] + (1/2)[1 -1 0] → [1 -1 0]

Burger's vector is conserved:
(1/2)[1 -1 0] + (1/2)[1 -1 0] = [1 -1 0]

SCID is the same on both sides (2). This reaction is feasible.

(C) (1/6)[1 1 -2] + (1/3)[1 1 1] → (1/2)[1 1 0]

To check the conservation of the Burger's vector, add the vectors on the left side and multiply them by their respective denominators:

(1/6)[1 1 -2] * 6 = [1 1 -2]
(1/3)[1 1 1] * 3 = [1 1 1]

Now add the resulting vectors:
[1 1 -2] + [1 1 1] = [2 2 -1]

The denominator of the right side is 2, so we need to make the left side have the same denominator by multiplying it by 2:
(2)[2 2 -1] = [1 1 0]

Now, the Burger's vector is conserved. However, the SCID on the left side is 6 and on the right side it is 2. The SCID is not the same, so this reaction is NOT feasible.

(D) (1/2)[-1 0 1] → (1/6)[-2 1 1] + (1/6)[-1 -1 2]

To check the conservation of the Burger's vector, add the vectors on the right side and multiply them by their respective denominators:

(1/6)[-2 1 1] * 6 = [-2 1 1]
(1/6)[-1 -1 2] * 6 = [-1 -1 2]

Now add the resulting vectors:
[-2 1 1] + [-1 -1 2] = [-3 0 3]

The denominator of the left side is 2 while the right side has 6, so we need to make them equal by multiplying the left side by 3:
(3)(1/2)[-1 0 1] = [-3 0 3]

Now, the Burger's vector is conserved. However, the SCID on the left side is 2 and on the right side it is 6. The SCID is not the same, so this reaction is NOT feasible.

Based on the analysis above, the correct answer is:

[(A), (C), (D)]
