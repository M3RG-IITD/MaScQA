We can use the formula below to calculate the number of atoms per unit area:

$$\text{Number of atoms per unit area}=\frac{Z\times N\times a^2}{4}$$

Where:
- Z is the atomic number of the element
- N is the Avogadro's number
- a is the lattice parameter of the crystal structure 

For FCC, the lattice parameter is related to the atomic radius by the equation:

$$a = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{3}r$$

where r is the atomic radius.

Substituting the given values, we get:

$$a=\frac{4\sqrt{2}}{3}\times0.175\text{ nm}=0.383\text{ nm}$$

Z for Pb is 82 and N is $6.022\times10^{23}$.

To find the number of atoms per unit area in the (100) plane, we first need to determine the lattice constant in the [100] direction. Since the [100] direction is perpendicular to the (100) plane, we know that the lattice constant along this direction is equal to the side length of the square formed by the intersection of four unit cells.

From the crystal structure, we know that there are four unit cells per plane in the [100] direction. Therefore, the lattice constant in the [100] direction is:

$$d = a\sqrt{2}=0.383\text{ nm}\times\sqrt{2}=0.542\text{ nm}$$

Now, we can calculate the area of the square formed by the intersection of four unit cells:

$$\text{Area} = d^2 = 0.542\text{ nm}\times0.542\text{ nm}=0.293\text{ nm}^2$$

Finally, we can use the formula to find the number of atoms per unit area:

$$\text{Number of atoms per unit area}=\frac{Z\times N\times a^2}{4}=\frac{82\times6.022\times10^{23}\times(0.383\text{ nm})^2}{4}=2.654\times10^{15}\text{ atoms/nm}^2$$

Rounding off to the nearest integer, we get:

Answer: [3e+15].
