We can use the Arrhenius equation for creep rate, which states that the creep rate (ε) is related to temperature (T) as follows:

ε = A * exp(-Q / (R * T))

where A is a constant, Q is the activation energy for creep, and R is the gas constant.

We're given that the creep rate at 980K is 20 times the creep rate at 890K. Let ε₁ be the creep rate at 890K, and ε₂ be the creep rate at 980K. Then:

ε₂ = 20 * ε₁

Using the Arrhenius equation for both temperatures, we have:

A * exp(-Q / (R * 890)) = ε₁
A * exp(-Q / (R * 980)) = ε₂

Substitute ε₂ with 20 * ε₁:

A * exp(-Q / (R * 980)) = 20 * A * exp(-Q / (R * 890))

Divide both sides by A * exp(-Q / (R * 890)):

exp(-Q / (R * 980)) / exp(-Q / (R * 890)) = 20

Combine the exponentials:

exp(Q / (R * 890) - Q / (R * 980)) = 20

Now, let's find the temperature (T_x) at which the creep rate is 5 times the creep rate at 890K:

ε_x = 5 * ε₁

Using the Arrhenius equation:

A * exp(-Q / (R * T_x)) = ε_x = 5 * A * exp(-Q / (R * 890))

Divide both sides by A * exp(-Q / (R * 890)):

exp(-Q / (R * T_x)) / exp(-Q / (R * 890)) = 5

Combine the exponentials:

exp(Q / (R * 890) - Q / (R * T_x)) = 5

Now, we have two equations:

1. exp(Q / (R * 890) - Q / (R * 980)) = 20
2. exp(Q / (R * 890) - Q / (R * T_x)) = 5

We notice the common term in both equations, so we can rewrite the second equation in terms of the first:

exp(Q / (R * 890) - Q / (R * T_x)) = 5 * exp(-(Q / (R * 980) - Q / (R * 890)))

Now, set Q / (R * 980) - Q / (R * 890) = y:

exp(Q / (R * 890) - Q / (R * T_x)) = 5 * exp(-y)

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

(Q / (R * 890) - Q / (R * T_x)) = -ln(5) * y

Substituting y:

(Q / (R * 890) - Q / (R * T_x)) = (-ln(5)) * (Q / (R * 980) - Q / (R * 890))

(Q / (R * 890) - Q / (R * T_x)) / (Q / (R * 980) - Q / (R * 890)) = -ln(5)

This equation relates T_x to the other temperatures (890 and 980). To find the value of T_x, we can solve for T_x:

1 / (T_x - 890) = -ln(5) / (980 - 890)

T_x - 890 = -90 / ln(5)
T_x = 890 - (90/ln(5))

Calculating T_x:

T_x ≈ 983

Therefore, the temperature at which the creep rate is 5 times the creep rate at 890 K is approximately 983 K. So,

x = 983

The answer in list form:
