Answer: (D) Electrical insulator.

Explanation:

A dielectric material is an electrical insulator that can be polarized by an electric field. When a dielectric material is placed in an electric field, the electrons in the material rearrange themselves, and the material becomes polarized. This polarization creates an electric field that opposes the electric field applied to the material. Due to this behavior, dielectric materials are also known as electrical insulators. 

Option (A), Electrical conductor, is incorrect because an electrical conductor conducts electricity and does not prevent the flow of current as an insulator or a dielectric material would.

Option (B), Metallic magnet, is incorrect because a magnet is a material that can exert a magnetic force on other materials and does not necessarily relate to conductivity or insulating behavior.

Option (C), Two coupled electrical conductors, is incorrect because it refers to a system in which two electrical conductors are connected in a way to exchange current or voltage, and does not relate to the properties of dielectric materials.
