Let's assume initially the crack length is a1 and the stress intensity range is ΔK1, so the crack growth rate is given by:

da/dN ∝ (ΔK1)^3

Now, suppose the crack length increases by a factor of two, making the new crack length a2 = 2 * a1. We have to find the new crack growth rate due to this increase in crack length.

We know that the stress intensity factor K is related to crack length as:

K = Y * σ * √(π * a)

Where Y is the geometry factor and σ is the applied stress. The equation shows that K is directly proportional to the square root of the crack length (a). So when we double the crack length (a2), the stress intensity factor K will also change. Let's find the new stress intensity range ΔK2.

ΔK2 ∝ √(2 * a1)

Now we can find the new crack growth rate da/dN:

da/dN ∝ (ΔK2)^3

da/dN ∝ ([(√(2 * a1))^3] ∝ (2 * a1)^(3/2)

Now, let's find the ratio of the new crack growth rate to the initial crack growth rate:

(da/dN)_new / (da/dN)_initial = [(2 * a1)^(3/2)] / [a1^3]

After simplifying the equation, we get:

(da/dN)_new / (da/dN)_initial = 2^(3/2)

Now, we can calculate the value of 2^(3/2):

(da/dN)_new / (da/dN)_initial ≈ 2.83

So, the crack growth rate will increase by a factor of approximately 2.83 when the crack length increases by a factor of two.

The answer is [2.83].
