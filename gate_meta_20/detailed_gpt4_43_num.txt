To find the anodic current density at an overpotential of 120 mV, we will make use of the Tafel equation for anodic reaction:

$\eta_a = a_a + b_a * log(i_a)$

Where:
- $\eta_a$ = anodic overpotential (in V)
- $a_a$ = anodic intercept, a constant (in V)
- $b_a$ = anodic Tafel slope (in V)
- $i_a$ = anodic current density (in $A.cm^{-2}$)

We are given that the anodic Tafel slope ($b_a$) is 0.06 V and the overpotential ($\eta_a$) is 120 mV (which equals to 0.12 V).

However, we need to find the anodic intercept ($a_a$) first. For this, we will use the limiting current density equation:

$i_L = n * F * D * C / \delta$

Where:
- $i_L$ = limiting current density (in $A.cm^{-2}$)
- $n$ = number of electrons involved in the reaction (in this case, 4 for the overall reaction)
- $F$ = Faraday's constant (96,485 C/mol)
- $D$ = diffusion coefficient (2.42 * $10^{-5} cm^2.s^{-1}$)
- $C$ = concentration of dissolved oxygen (15 mM or 15 * $10^{-3} mol/cm^3$)
- $\delta$ = diffusion layer thickness (0.06 cm)

Let's first calculate the limiting current density ($i_L$):

$i_L = 4 * 96,485 * 2.42 * 10^{-5} * 15 * 10^{-3} / 0.06$

$i_L \approx 0.00964 A.cm^{-2}$

Now, at the limiting current density, the overpotential ($\eta_L$) is equal to anodic intercept ($a_a$):

$a_a = 0.06 * log(0.00964/i_0)$

Where $i_0$ is the exchange current density. It can be calculated from the Tafel equation:

$i_0 = 10^{a_a/b_a}$

Now, let's substitute the values of $a_a$ and $b_a$:

$log(0.00964/i_0) = \frac{0.12}{0.06}$

$log(0.00964/i_0) = 2$

Now, we can solve for $i_0$:

$i_0 = 0.00964 / 10^2$

$i_0 \approx 9.64 * 10^{-5} A.cm^{-2}$

Finally, we can find the anodic current density ($i_a$) at the given overpotential of 120 mV (0.12 V) using the Tafel equation:

$i_a = i_0 * 10^{(\eta_a / b_a)}$

$i_a = 9.64 * 10^{-5} * 10^{(0.12 / 0.06)}$

$i_a \approx 0.009638 A.cm^{-2}$

Rounding off to three decimal places, we get the anodic current density:

$i_a \approx 0.010 A.cm^{-2}$

Thus, the anodic current density at an overpotential of 120 mV is approximately 0.010 $A.cm^{-2}$.
