To solve this problem, we need to use the Arrhenius equation, which relates the creep rate (also known as the steady-state creep rate) to temperature. The general form of the Arrhenius equation is:

Creep rate (ε) = A * exp(-Q/RT)

Here,
ε = steady-state creep rate
A = pre-exponential factor (a constant)
Q = activation energy for creep (a constant, expressed in Joules)
R = gas constant (8.314 J/mol-K)
T = absolute temperature (in Kelvin)

Now, we are given that the creep rate increases by a factor of 20 when the temperature is increased from 890K to 980K. Let's represent the creep rate at 890K as ε1 and the creep rate at 980K as ε2. Then, we can write:

ε2 = 20 * ε1

Using the Arrhenius equation, we can represent each of these creep rates in terms of temperature:

ε1 = A * exp(-Q/(R * 890K))
ε2 = A * exp(-Q/(R * 980K))

Since ε2 = 20 * ε1, we can substitute these expressions into the equation:

A * exp(-Q/(R * 980K)) = 20 * (A * exp(-Q/(R * 890K)))

The pre-exponential factor (A) cancels out:

exp(-Q/(R * 980K)) = 20 * exp(-Q/(R * 890K))

We are also given that the creep rate at a temperature of x K will be 5 times the creep rate at 890 K. Let ε3 represent the creep rate at x K, then:

ε3 = 5 * ε1

Using the Arrhenius equation again:

ε3 = A * exp(-Q/(R * x K))

Since ε3 = 5 * ε1, we can substitute the expressions again:

A * exp(-Q/(R * x K)) = 5 * (A * exp(-Q/(R * 890K)))

The pre-exponential factor (A) cancels out again:

exp(-Q/(R * x K)) = 5 * exp(-Q/(R * 890K))

Now we have two equations:

1) exp(-Q/(R * 980K)) = 20 * exp(-Q/(R * 890K))
2) exp(-Q/(R * x K)) = 5 * exp(-Q/(R * 890K))

To solve for x, we can divide equation 1 by equation 2:

[exp(-Q/(R * 980K))] / [exp(-Q/(R * x K))] = 20 / 5

exp(-Q/(R * x K)) = exp(-Q/(R * 980K)) / 4

Now we can take the natural logarithm of both sides:

-Q/(R * x K) = ln[exp(-Q/(R * 980K)) / 4]

-Q/(R * x K) = -Q/(R * 980K) - ln(4)

Now isolate x:

x = (Q * 980) / (Q + ln(4) * R * 980)

Finally, to find x to the nearest integer, we round the result:

x = round((Q * 980) / (Q + ln(4) * R * 980))

We do not have the values of Q here, so we cannot get an exact numerical value for x. The final expression for x in terms of Q is:

[round((Q * 980) / (Q + ln(4) * R * 980))]
