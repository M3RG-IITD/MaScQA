The (100) plane of an FCC structure is a square-shaped plane where each side makes a 45-degree angle with the three axes. The atoms touch each other along the plane diagonal. The plane diagonal is given by: 

$d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}$, where $a$ is the edge length of the unit cell.

In an FCC structure, there are atoms at each corner and at the center of each face. Therefore, there are a total of four atoms in the (100) plane. 

The area of the (100) plane is then given by: 

$A = d^2 = \frac{a^2}{2}$ 

The number of atoms per unit area is then: 

$\frac{4}{A} = \frac{4}{\frac{a^2}{2}} = \frac{8}{a^2}$ 

Given the atomic radius of Pb as 0.175 nm, the edge length of the unit cell can be calculated as: 

$a = 2\sqrt{2}r = 2\sqrt{2}(0.175) = 0.494 nm$ 

Substituting this value in the earlier expression gives: 

$\frac{8}{a^2} = \frac{8}{(0.494)^2} \approx 32$

Therefore, the number of atoms per unit area in the (100) plane of Pb is approximately 32.

Answer: [32]
