Step 1: Understanding the question and given information.
The question is asking about the properties of heavily cold-worked metal. The options are (A) yield a coarser recrystallized grain size, (B) possess a lower driving force for recrystallization, (C) have a higher energy barrier for nucleation of recrystallized grains, and (D) recrystallize at lower temperatures.

Step 2: Understanding the concept of cold-working and recrystallization.
Cold-working is a process of deforming a metal at room temperature to make it stronger and harder. However, this process also results in the formation of defects in the metal's crystal structure, such as dislocations. Recrystallization is a process that occurs when a cold-worked metal is heated to a certain temperature, and new grains with a defect-free crystal structure are formed to replace the deformed grains.

Step 3: Understanding the effect of cold working on recrystallization.
Heavily cold-worked metals have a high density of defects, especially dislocations. These defects act as nucleation sites for new grains during recrystallization. Therefore, heavily cold-worked metals have a lower energy barrier for nucleation of recrystallized grains, which means they are more likely to recrystallize. However, the high density of defects also means that the recrystallized grains will be finer, not coarser, than in a lightly cold-worked metal. Additionally, the driving force for recrystallization is higher in heavily cold-worked metals, as they have a greater need to replace the deformed grains with defect-free grains. Finally, heavily cold-worked metals require a higher temperature to recrystallize, as the energy barrier for nucleation is lower.

Step 4: Choosing the correct answer.
Option (A) is incorrect, as heavily cold-worked metals yield finer recrystallized grains, not coarser. Option (B) is also incorrect, as heavily cold-worked metals possess a higher driving force for recrystallization, not a lower one. Option (C) is correct, as heavily cold-worked metals have a lower energy barrier for nucleation of recrystallized grains. Option (D) is incorrect, as heavily cold-worked metals recrystallize at higher temperatures, not lower ones.

Step 5: Writing the correct answer.
The correct answer is (C) have a higher energy barrier for nucleation of recrystallized grains. 

Therefore, the correct answer is:
- (C) have a higher energy barrier for nucleation of recrystallized grains.
