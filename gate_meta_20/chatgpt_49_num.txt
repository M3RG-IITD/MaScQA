The mass balance equation for sulphur is:

Mass of S in steel + Mass of S in slag = Total Mass of S

Initially, Mass of S in steel = 0.03 wt.% of 1000 kg steel = 0.3 kg

Finally, Mass of S in steel = 0.015 wt.% of 1000 kg steel = 0.15 kg

Therefore, the total mass of sulphur that needs to be removed = 0.3 - 0.15 = 0.15 kg

Let x be the quantity of slag needed in kg.

The weight percent of S in the slag can be calculated as follows:

[(wt.% S)in slag]/[(wt.% S) in steel] = 50

[(wt.% S)in slag]/0.03 = 50

(wt.% S)in slag = 1.5

Mass of S in slag = (1.5/100) * x

Therefore, the mass balance equation becomes:

0.15 + (1.5/100) * x = x * (1.5/100)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 10 kg (rounded off to the nearest integer)

Therefore, 10 kg of slag is needed to desulphurize the steel.
