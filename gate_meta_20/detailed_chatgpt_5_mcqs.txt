An electrolytic cell involves a non-spontaneous reaction that is driven by an external voltage source, whereas a galvanic cell involves a spontaneous reaction that produces an external voltage. The process that is an example of an electrolytic cell is:

(B) Charging of a rechargeable battery

In this process, an external voltage source is connected to the battery, causing a non-spontaneous reaction that drives the recharge of the battery. The other processes listed are examples of galvanic cells or other forms of corrosion protection.
