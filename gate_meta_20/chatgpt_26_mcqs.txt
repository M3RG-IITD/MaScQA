The correct answer is (C) Position 1: unstable equilibrium; Position 2: stable; Position 3: unstable. At position 1, dislocation Z is in an unstable equilibrium because it is equidistant from dislocations X and Y, which have opposite Burgers vectors. Any deviation from this position will result in a net force acting on dislocation Z, driving it away from position 1. At position 2, dislocation Z is in a stable equilibrium because it is closer to dislocation X than to dislocation Y, resulting in a net force pulling it towards position 2. At position 3, dislocation Z is again in an unstable equilibrium because it is equidistant from dislocations X and Y, with the same configuration as position 1.
