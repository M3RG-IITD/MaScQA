The driving force for a process is the difference between the current state of the system and the state of equilibrium. In this case, the current state is liquid copper at a temperature of 1353 K, and the equilibrium state is solid copper at a temperature of 1356 K. The driving force for the liquid to transform to solid is therefore the difference in Gibbs free energy between the two states.

The Gibbs free energy change for a process can be calculated using the formula:

ΔG = ΔH - TΔS

where ΔH is the enthalpy change, T is the temperature, and ΔS is the entropy change. Since the process involves the melting of copper, ΔS is positive (since the entropy of liquid copper is higher than that of solid copper). However, since we are interested in the process of solidification (not melting), we need to reverse the sign of ΔS:

ΔG = ΔH - T(-ΔS) = ΔH + TΔS

Substituting in the values given in the question, we get:

ΔG = 13 kJ/mol + 1353 K * (-0.042 J/mol/K)

Note that we need to convert the units of ΔS from J/mol/K (given in the data) to kJ/mol/K, to match the units of ΔH:

ΔG = 13 kJ/mol - 56.83 kJ/mol

ΔG = -43.8 kJ/mol

Therefore, the magnitude of the driving force for liquid copper to transform to solid copper at a temperature of 1353 K is 43.8 kJ/mol. 

Final answer: [43.8 kJ/mol]
