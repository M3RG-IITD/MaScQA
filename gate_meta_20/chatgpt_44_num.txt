We can use the following equation to solve the question:

$$
t=\frac{(k\rho)^{-1}}{(1/3)\Delta c^2}
$$

where t is the time taken for the oxide film to grow to a thickness of Δc, k is the parabolic rate constant, and ρ is the density of the oxide.

Plugging in the given values:

$$
t=\frac{(3\times10^{-6} \text{ g}^2.\text{cm}^{-4}.\text{s}^{-1})(6.5 \text{ g.cm}^{-3})^{-1}}{(1/3)(2 \text{ }\mu\text{m})^2}=0.0129 \text{ s} = \boxed{0.01 \text{ s (rounded off to two decimal places)}}
$$
