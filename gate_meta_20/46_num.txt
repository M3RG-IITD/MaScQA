Assume:( 1. Incompressible flow with no friction losses. 2. Density of air is 1kg $m^(-3)$. Density of water is 1000 kg $m^(-3)$. Acceleration due to gravity is 9.8 $ms^(-2)$.) Figure shows schematic of a venturimeter. The cross sectional area is 100 $mm^2$ at A and is 50 $mm^2$ at B. If the air is flowing through the venturimeter at a flow rate of $10^(-3)m^(3).s^(-1), the height(in mm) H in the air-over-water manometer is?(round off to the nearest integer)
