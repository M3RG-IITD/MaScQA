Based on the given information, we know that the initial temperature is 300K and the adiabatic flame temperature when burned with stoichiometric oxygen is 5975K. When burning with excess oxygen, the adiabatic flame temperature will be lower since there will be an excess of water formed which will absorb some of the heat. Therefore, the answer is option (C) lower than 5975 K irrespective of the amount of excess oxygen.
