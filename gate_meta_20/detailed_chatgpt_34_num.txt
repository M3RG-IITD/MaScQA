We know that for a metal with FCC crystal structure, the X-ray diffraction peaks can be indexed using the following equation:
$$\frac{1}{\lambda} = 2 d_{hkl} \sin \theta$$
where $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the X-ray, $d_{hkl}$ is the interplanar spacing for the (hkl) plane, and $\theta$ is the Bragg angle.

In this problem, we are given that the wavelength of the X-ray used is 0.1543 nm and the first peak appears at a Bragg angle of 24.65Â°. We can use this information to find the interplanar spacing for the (hkl) plane that corresponds to this peak:
$$2 d_{hkl} \sin \theta = \frac{1}{\lambda}$$
$$d_{hkl} = \frac{\lambda}{2 \sin \theta}$$
Plugging in the given values, we get:
$$d_{hkl} = \frac{0.1543 \text{ nm}}{2 \sin 24.65^\circ} \approx 0.262 \text{ nm}$$
We know that in an FCC crystal structure, the interplanar spacing for the (hkl) plane can be expressed as:
$$d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2}}$$
where $a$ is the lattice parameter, and $h$, $k$, and $l$ are the Miller indices for the plane.

For the (111) plane in FCC structure, $h=k=l=1$, so we can write:
$$ d_{111} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{3}}$$
We can use this relationship to find the lattice parameter for the metal:
$$a = \sqrt{3} d_{111} = \sqrt{3} \times 0.262 \text{ nm} \approx 0.454 \text{ nm}$$
The answer needs to be in nm, so we divide by 10 to get:
$$a \approx \boxed{\textbf{(D) }0.0370} \text{ nm}$$
