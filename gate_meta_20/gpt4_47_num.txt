Given data:
Ball mill inner diameter (d) = 3.26 m
Angular distance between OB and BC (angle ∠BOC) = 120°
Acceleration due to gravity (g) = 9.8 $m.s^{-2}$

Let's analyze the situation at point C.
As the ball moves along the path CDA, two effects will happen. First, when the ball leaves the wall, a centrifugal force will push the ball away from the center of rotation. Second, the gravitational force will act to pull the ball down.

For the ball to travel freely along the path CDA without sticking to the wall, the centrifugal force F_c must exactly balance the horizontal component of the gravitational force F_g_horizontal at point C. To analyze this force balance, we consider the angle ∠BOC and break gravitational force into its horizontal and vertical components.

At point C, the horizontal component of the gravitational force acting on the ball is:
F_g_horizontal = m * g * cos(∠BOC)

The centrifugal force acting on the ball is:
F_c = m * r * ω^2, where r = d / 2 (half of the diameter) and ω is the angular velocity.

As per the force balance at point C:
F_c = F_g_horizontal

m * r * ω^2 = m * g * cos(∠BOC)

Now solve for ω:
ω^2 = (g * cos(∠BOC)) / r

We can convert the angular velocity ω to the rotational speed N (in rpm):

N = (60 * ω) / (2 * pi)

So, we have:
N = (60 * sqrt((g * cos(∠BOC)) / r)) / (2 * pi)

Plug in the given values:

N = (60 * sqrt((9.8 * cos(120°)) / (3.26 / 2))) / (2 * pi)

N ≈ 8.8 rpm (rounded to one decimal place)

So, the rotational speed of the mill is approximately 8.8 rpm.
