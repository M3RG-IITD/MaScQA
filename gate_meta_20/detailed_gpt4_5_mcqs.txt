An electrolytic cell is a type of electrochemical cell where an electric energy is used to drive a non-spontaneous redox reaction. Let's discuss each option to see which one best fits the description of an electrolytic cell.

(A) Corrosion of a metal rod in the ambient atmosphere:
Corrosion is a natural process that occurs when a metal is exposed to the atmosphere and reacts with surrounding substances, such as water and oxygen, to form more stable metal oxides. This is a spontaneous redox process and not an example of an electrolytic cell.

(B) Charging of a rechargeable battery:
When a rechargeable battery is being charged, an external voltage is applied to reverse the spontaneous discharge reaction occurring within the battery. This process forces the electrons to flow in the opposite direction and regenerate the reactants from the products, restoring the battery's capacity. This is an example of a non-spontaneous redox reaction being driven by electric energy, which fits the description of an electrolytic cell.

(C) Discharging of a rechargeable battery:
During the discharging of a rechargeable battery, the stored chemical energy is converted into electrical energy as the spontaneous redox reaction occurs within the battery. This is a spontaneous process and not an example of an electrolytic cell.

(D) Sacrificial cathodic protection system:
In a sacrificial cathodic protection system, a more active metal (often zinc or magnesium) is connected to the metal to be protected (typically steel or iron). The sacrificial metal corrodes in preference to the protected metal and acts as the anode in a galvanic cell. This is a spontaneous redox process which occurs without the need for any external electrical energy, hence not an electrolytic cell.

Based on the above analysis, the correct answer is:
