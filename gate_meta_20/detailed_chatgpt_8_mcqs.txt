Superplasticity is the ability of certain materials to exhibit very large elongations (typically more than several hundred percent) without fracturing, under certain conditions like high temperature and low strain rates. The correct answer to the given question is (B) High strain-rate sensitivity. 

Explanation:

Superplasticity is a unique property of some materials that occur when they are deformed under certain conditions. Fine-grained metals and alloys are known to exhibit superplasticity because of their special microstructural characteristics. One of the key requirements for a material to exhibit superplasticity is high strain-rate sensitivity. 

In simple terms, strain-rate sensitivity refers to the change in flow stress (resistance to deformation) of a material with a change in the deformation rate. Materials that exhibit high strain-rate sensitivity (SRS) show a decrease in flow stress as the deformation rate decreases. This behavior is opposite to that of conventional metals, which show an increase in flow stress with decreasing deformation rate. 

For superplastic deformation to occur, a balance must exist between the deformation-induced grain growth and grain-boundary sliding. Fine-grained materials possess a large number of grain boundaries that facilitate grain-boundary sliding. The strain-rate sensitivity of the material is an important factor that determines whether grain-boundary sliding or grain growth is the dominant process for superplastic deformation. 

In summary, high strain-rate sensitivity is a requirement for superplasticity because it enables grain-boundary sliding and fine-grained microstructures to undergo large plastic deformation without fracturing. Other factors such as low strain-hardening exponent and uniform deformation are desirable but not essential for superplastic deformation. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) High strain-rate sensitivity.
