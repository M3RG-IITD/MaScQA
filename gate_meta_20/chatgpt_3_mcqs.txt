The slip system in a FCC copper crystal must satisfy the Schmid's law, which states that for a slip to occur, resolved shear stress on the slip plane in the slip direction must exceed a critical value. This critical value of resolved shear stress is given by $\tau_{CRSS} = \frac{\mu}{\sqrt{2}}$, where $\mu$ is the shear modulus of the material. 

Using this law, we can calculate the critical resolved shear stress for each of the given slip systems in FCC copper crystal and eliminate the invalid one.

(A) (1 1 1)[1 -1 0]: The slip direction is [1 -1 0], and the Miller indices of the slip plane (1 1 1) are normal to [1 -1 0]. The resolved shear stress on this slip system is $\tau = \frac{\sqrt{6}}{6}\sigma$, where $\sigma$ is the applied tensile stress in a direction normal to the slip plane. This slip system is valid as $\tau_{CRSS} = \frac{\mu}{\sqrt{2}} < \frac{\sqrt{6}}{6}\sigma$.

(B) (-1 1 1)[0 1 1]: The slip direction is [0 1 1], and the Miller indices of the slip plane (-1 1 1) are normal to [0 1 1]. The resolved shear stress on this slip system is $\tau = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\sigma$, where $\sigma$ is the applied tensile stress in a direction normal to the slip plane. This slip system is valid as $\tau_{CRSS} = \frac{\mu}{\sqrt{2}} < \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\sigma$.

(C) (1 -1 1)[1 0 -1]: The slip direction is [1 0 -1], and the Miller indices of the slip plane (1 -1 1) are normal to [1 0 -1]. The resolved shear stress on this slip system is $\tau = \frac{\sqrt{6}}{6}\sigma$, where $\sigma$ is the applied tensile stress in a direction normal to the slip plane. This slip system is valid as $\tau_{CRSS} = \frac{\mu}{\sqrt{2}} < \frac{\sqrt{6}}{6}\sigma$.

(D) (1 1 -1)[1 0 1]: The slip direction is [1 0 1], and the Miller indices of the slip plane (1 1 -1) are normal to [1 0 1]. The resolved shear stress on this slip system is $\tau = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\sigma$, where $\sigma$ is the applied tensile stress in a direction normal to the slip plane. This slip system is not valid as $\tau_{CRSS} = \frac{\mu}{\sqrt{2}} > \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\sigma$.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) (1 1 -1)[1 0 1]. 

Answer: 
- (D) (1 1 -1)[1 0 1]
