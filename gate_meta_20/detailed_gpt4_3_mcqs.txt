To determine whether a slip system is valid in a FCC copper crystal, we need to check if the slip plane and slip direction follows the two basic criteria for a valid slip system:

1. The slip plane should be a close-packed plane, i.e., the plane with the highest linear density of atoms.
2. The slip direction should be a close-packed direction, i.e., the direction with the highest linear density of atoms within the plane.

For an FCC crystal, the close-packed planes are the {1 1 1} type planes, and the close-packed directions are the <1 1 0> type directions.

Let's examine each slip system:

(A) (1 1 1)[1 -1 0]

Slip plane: (1 1 1) - This is a {1 1 1} type plane, which is a close-packed plane in an FCC crystal.
Slip direction: [1 -1 0] - This is a <1 1 0> type direction, which is a close-packed direction in an FCC crystal.
Thus, this is a valid slip system.

(B) (-1 1 1)[0 1 1]

Slip plane: (-1 1 1) - This is a {1 1 1} type plane, which is a close-packed plane in an FCC crystal.
Slip direction: [0 1 1] - This is NOT a <1 1 0> type direction, which is not a close-packed direction in an FCC crystal.
Thus, this is NOT a valid slip system.

(C) (1 -1 1)[1 0 -1]

Slip plane: (1 -1 1) - This is a {1 1 1} type plane, which is a close-packed plane in an FCC crystal.
Slip direction: [1 0 -1] - This is a <1 1 0> type direction, which is a close-packed direction in an FCC crystal.
Thus, this is a valid slip system.

(D) (1 1 -1)[1 0 1]

Slip plane: (1 1 -1) - This is a {1 1 1} type plane, which is a close-packed plane in an FCC crystal.
Slip direction: [1 0 1] - This is a <1 1 0> type direction, which is a close-packed direction in an FCC crystal.
Thus, this is a valid slip system.

So the correct answer is:

[B]
