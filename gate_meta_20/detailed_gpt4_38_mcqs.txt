We will analyze both the Assertion [a] and Reason [r] separately and then determine their relationship.

Assertion [a]: The rate of homogenization in a dilute substitutional solid solution of B in A is controlled by the diffusivity of B.

This assertion is true. In a substitutional solid solution, the solute atoms of B substitute for some of the solvent atoms of A. Homogenization refers to the process of achieving a uniform distribution of solute atoms (B) throughout the solvent lattice (A). The degree to which the solute atoms are able to diffuse and distribute themselves in the solvent lattice determines the rate of homogenization. Hence, the diffusivity of B plays a crucial role in controlling the rate of homogenization.

Reason [r]: Atomic migration cannot occur along dislocations and grain boundaries.

This reason is false. In fact, atomic migration can occur more easily along dislocations and grain boundaries as compared to the main lattice. Dislocations and grain boundaries are regions with higher energy and lower atomic packing than the ideal lattice, which offer a faster path for the diffusion of atoms. Atomic migration through these paths accelerates the homogenization process.

As [a] is true and [r] is false, the correct answer is (D) [a] is true but [r] is false.

Answer: [D]
