In a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure, the diffraction peaks can be observed only for the reflections that satisfy the condition of h + k + l = even, where h, k, and l are the Miller indices.

Step 1: Calculate the Bragg equation
The Bragg equation is given by:
nλ = 2d * sin(θ)

Here, n=1 (since we are considering the first peak), and the wavelength λ = 0.1543 nm. The Bragg angle θ = 24.65°.

Step 2: Calculate the interplanar distance (d)
We can calculate the interplanar distance (d) using the Bragg equation:
d = (nλ) / (2 * sin(θ))
d = (1 * 0.1543) / (2 * sin(24.65))
d = 0.1543 / (2 * 0.41674)
d = 0.185 nm

Step 3: Calculate the lattice parameter (a)
For an FCC crystal structure, the interplanar distance (d) is related to the lattice parameter (a) by the formula:
d = a / (sqrt(h^2 + k^2 + l^2))

For the first peak, the smallest set of Miller indices that satisfies the condition h + k + l = even is h = 1, k = 1, and l = 0. Therefore, the Miller indices are (1, 1, 0).

Now, we can calculate the lattice parameter (a) using the interplanar distance (d) and the Miller indices (1, 1, 0):
a = d * sqrt(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)
a = 0.185 * sqrt(1^2 + 1^2 + 0^2)
a = 0.185 * sqrt(1 + 1)
a = 0.185 * sqrt(2)
a = 0.262 nm

Hence, the correct answer is (B) 0.262 nm.
