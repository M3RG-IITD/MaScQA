Let's work through this step by step:

1. First, we have to understand the hard sphere model of atomic structures. In this model, atoms are treated as solid spheres which are in contact with one another.

2. We're given the radius of the Fe atom as 0.124 nm.

3. Next, we need to know the arrangement of atoms in BCC (body-centered cubic) iron. In this structure, there are 8 atoms located at 8 corners of the cube and 1 atom at the center of the cube.

4. We need to find the positions of octahedral voids in BCC iron. In the BCC structure, octahedral voids are located at the midpoints of the edges (half the distance between the face-centered and corner atoms).

5. Now, let's calculate the size of the octahedral void. To do this, we can imagine drawing a straight line from one midpoint of the edge to another, passing through the face-centered point.

6. Let the edge length of the cube be 'a' (in nm). In BCC structure, the distance between two Fe atoms (located at the cube center and corner) can be calculated as:

   √3*a/2 = 2 * radius of Fe atom
   a = (2 * 0.124) * 2/√3
   
7. Calculate the edge length 'a':

   a ≈ 0.287 nm

8. Now, we can calculate the distance between two midpoints of the edges. This can be done by considering a right triangle with the midpoint distance (d) as the hypotenuse and half of the edge length (a/2) as one of the legs.

   d^2 = (a/2)^2 + (a/2)^2

9. Calculate the distance d:
   
   d ≈ 0.204 nm

10. Finally, to find the radius of the largest interstitial atom that can be accommodated in the octahedral void, we can subtract the radius of the Fe atom from half of the distance between the two octahedral voids:

    Largest interstitial atom radius ≈ (d - edge length of two Fe atoms touching each other)/2

11. Calculate the radius of the largest interstitial atom:

    Largest interstitial atom radius ≈ (0.204 - 2*0.124)/2 ≈ 0.042 nm (rounded to three decimal places)

The radius of the largest interstitial atom that can be accommodated in an octahedral void in BCC iron without distorting the lattice is approximately 0.042 nm.

Answer: [0.042]
