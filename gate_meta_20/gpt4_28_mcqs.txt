We can use the Nernst equation to find the relationship between the concentrations of the Fe(+2) and Zn(+2) ions in the cell. The Nernst equation is:

E = E° - (RT/nF) * ln(Q)

Where E is the cell potential, E° is the standard cell potential, R is the gas constant (8.314 J.mol^(-1).K^(-1)), T is the temperature in Kelvin (298 K), n is the number of moles of electrons transferred in the reaction, F is the Faraday's constant (96500 C.mol^(-1)), and Q is the reaction quotient.

First, let's determine the standard cell potential, E°, for the overall reaction:

E°(overall) = E°(Fe(+2)/Fe) - E°(Zn(+2)/Zn)

E°(overall) = (-0.44 V) - (-0.76 V)

E°(overall) = 0.32 V

Now, we can use the Nernst equation to find the ratio of the concentrations of the ions:

0.5 V = 0.32 V - (8.314 J.mol^(-1).K^(-1) * 298 K / (2 * 96500 C.mol^(-1)) * ln([Fe(+2)]/[Zn(+2)]))

0.18 V = -(8.314 J.mol^(-1).K^(-1) * 298 K / (2 * 96500 C.mol^(-1))) * ln([Fe(+2)]/[Zn(+2)])

Now, we will solve for the ln([Fe(+2)]/[Zn(+2)]):

ln([Fe(+2)]/[Zn(+2)]) = - (0.18 V * 2 * 96500 C.mol^(-1)) / (8.314 J.mol^(-1).K^(-1) * 298 K)

ln([Fe(+2)]/[Zn(+2)]) = - 11.44

Now, we will find the ratio [Fe(+2)]/[Zn(+2)] by raising e to the power of the result:

[Fe(+2)]/[Zn(+2)] = e^(-11.44) ≈ 1.03 * 10^(-5)

So, the ratio of the concentration of [Fe(+2)] to [Zn(+2)] ions in the cell is of the order of 10^(-5). Therefore, the correct answer is (B) $10^(-5)$.
