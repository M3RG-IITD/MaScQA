To calculate the quantity of slag needed for desulphurization, we need to know the initial amount of sulphur in the steel and the final amount of sulphur after desulphurization. 

Given: 
Initial weight of steel, w = 1000 kg 
Initial S content in steel, C1 = 0.03 wt.%
Final S content in steel, C2 = 0.015 wt.% 

Let x be the weight of slag required for desulphurization. 

We know from the given partition ratio that: 

[(wt.%S)in slag]/[(wt.%S) in steel] = 50 

Or, [(wt.%S)in slag] = 50 x [(wt.%S) in steel] 

At the initial state, the weight of S in the steel, ws1 = w x C1 
And the weight of S in the slag, wslag1 = x x [(wt.%S)in slag] 

At equilibrium, the total weight of S remains constant. Therefore, 

(ws1 - ws2) = (wslag2 - wslag1) 

Where ws2 = w x C2 and wslag2 = x x [(wt.%S)in slag] 

Substituting the values and simplifying, we get: 

x = ws1 - ((ws1 - ws2)/(1 + [(wt.%S)in slag])) 

Plugging in the values, we get: 

x = 1000 x 0.03 - ((1000 x 0.03 - 1000 x 0.015)/(1 + 50)) 

x = 25 kg (rounded off to the nearest integer) 

Therefore, the quantity of slag needed for desulphurization is 25 kg.
