In green sand casting, the part that is NOT typically a part of the gating system is (D) Pouring basin. 

Explanation:

The gating system in green sand casting includes the following components:

1. Sprue: It is a vertical channel through which the molten metal enters the mold cavity. 

2. Runner: It is a horizontal channel that connects the sprue to the mold cavity. 

3. Riser: It is an extra cavity that holds excess molten metal, allowing it to solidify and feed molten metal to the casting as it contracts.
 
4. Gate: It is the point where the molten metal enters the mold cavity from the runner.
 
There is no pouring basin involved in the gating system of green sand casting.
