The Rockwell hardness test is a method used to measure the hardness of materials. It is determined by measuring the depth of penetration of an indenter under a large load compared to the penetration made by a preload.

There are several different Rockwell hardness scales, each with a different indenter type and load combination. One of the scales is the Rockwell C scale, which is used to test the hardness of materials such as hardened steels and cemented carbides.

Now, let's analyze each option:

(A) Diamond cone: The diamond cone, also known as the Brale indenter, is used for Rockwell A and Rockwell C scales.

(B) 10mm steel ball: The 10mm steel ball indenter is used in the Rockwell B scale, which is used to test the hardness of materials like brass, aluminum, etc.

(C) Diamond pyramid: The diamond pyramid, also known as the Vickers indenter, is not used in Rockwell hardness testing. It is used in Vickers hardness testing.

(D) 1/16 in. steel ball: The 1/16 in. steel ball indenter is used in Rockwell E, F, and N scales, which are used to test thin and soft materials.

Based on the information above, the correct answer for the indenter used in Rockwell hardness measurements on the C scale is:

[A] A diamond cone
