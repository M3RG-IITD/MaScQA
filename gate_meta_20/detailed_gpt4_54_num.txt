Given the reaction:

$[C]_{(1\,\text{wt.%}\,\text{Henrian}\,\text{Std.}\,\text{State})} + [O]_{(1\,\text{wt.%}\,\text{Henrian}\,\text{Std.}\,\text{State})} \to (CO)_{(1\,\text{atm.}\,\text{Std.}\,\text{State})}$

The Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) is given as:

ΔG° = -19840 - 40.65T J

We also have the gas constant (R) given as:

R = 8.314 J.mol⁻¹.K⁻¹

Assuming equilibrium between dissolved carbon [C], dissolved oxygen [O], and CO (gas) at 1 atmosphere, and Henry's law is valid for both [C] and [O].

At equilibrium, the reaction quotient (Q) is equal to the equilibrium constant (K). The reaction quotient for the reaction can be written as:

$Q = \frac{[CO]}{[C][O]} $

At equilibrium:

$K = \frac{[CO]}{[C][O]} $

We can also relate ΔG°, K, and R using the following formula:

ΔG° = -RT ln(K)

Let's solve for K:

$K = e^{-\frac{\Delta G^{\circ}}{RT}}$

Plug in the given values:

$K = e^{-\frac{(-19840 - 40.65 \times 1800)}{8.314 \times 1800}}$

$K \approx 1.9383 \times 10^{-11}$

Now we know that the dissolved oxygen content in the steel is 0.03 wt.% and the steel temperature is 1800K.

Since Henry's law is valid for both [C] and [O]:

$\frac{[O]}{1\,\text{wt.%}} = \frac{0.03\,\text{wt.%}}{1\,\text{wt.%}}$

$[O] = 0.03$

Substitute the values of [O] and K into the equilibrium expression:

$K = \frac{[CO]}{[C][O]}$

$1.9383 \times 10^{-11} = \frac{[CO]}{[C] \times 0.03}$

Assuming 1:1 stoichiometry of the reaction, we can set [C]=[CO]. Hence, 

$1.9383 \times 10^{-11} = \frac{[C]}{[C] \times 0.03}$

Solve for [C]:

$[C] = 1.9383 \times 10^{-11} \times 0.03$

$[C] \approx 5.815 \times 10^{-13}$ (in wt.%)

To convert the result to two decimal places:

$[C] \approx 0.00$ (in wt.%)

So, the carbon content [C] in the steel is approximately 0.00 wt.%.
