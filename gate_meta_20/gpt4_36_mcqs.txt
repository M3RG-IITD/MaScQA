We can use the lever rule to find the amount (in wt.%) of eutectic constituent present in the alloy Mg-50 wt.% Sn.

According to the lever rule:

$$\frac{Weight \; of \; eutectic \; constituent}{Total \; weight} = \frac{50 - 36.9}{14.48 - 36.9}$$

Solving for the weight of eutectic constituent:

$$Weight \; of \; eutectic \; constituent = \frac{50 - 36.9}{14.48 - 36.9} × 100$$

$$Weight \; of \; eutectic \; constituent = \frac{13.1}{-22.42} × 100 = 0.5842 × 100$$

The amount (in wt.%) of eutectic constituent present in the alloy is approximately 58.42%.

However, since we need to pick from the available options, 62% (C) is the closest answer. Thus, the correct answer is [C].
