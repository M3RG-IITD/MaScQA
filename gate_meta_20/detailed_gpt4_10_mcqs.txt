To answer this question, let's first understand the concept of adiabatic flame temperature.

The adiabatic flame temperature is the highest temperature that can be achieved when a fuel is burnt in a stoichiometric mixture with pure oxygen. When there is no heat transfer between the system (combustion chamber) and the surroundings, the process is said to be adiabatic.

Now, let's consider the combustion reaction of propane:

C₃H₈ + 5O₂ → 3CO₂ + 4H₂O

In this reaction, 1 mole of propane reacts with 5 moles of oxygen to produce 3 moles of carbon dioxide and 4 moles of water.

Now let's analyze the given conditions with the possible answer choices:

(A) Equal to 5975K irrespective of the amount of excess oxygen:

Under stoichiometric conditions (1 mole of propane reacting completely with 5 moles of oxygen), the adiabatic flame temperature is 5975K. If there is excess oxygen, the combustion reaction remains the same, but there will be unused oxygen molecules in the system. As a result, some of the heat generated from the combustion will be absorbed by the excess oxygen molecules, thus lowering the overall adiabatic flame temperature. So this option is incorrect.

(B) Higher than 5975K irrespective of the amount of excess oxygen:

Since excess oxygen absorbs some of the heat generated during the combustion process, the adiabatic flame temperature cannot be higher than the stoichiometric case of 5975K. So this option is incorrect.

(C) Lower than 5975K irrespective of the amount of excess oxygen:

As explained earlier, the excess oxygen will absorb some heat, reducing the overall adiabatic flame temperature. So this option is correct.

(D) Higher or lower than 5975K depending on the amount of excess oxygen:

The adiabatic flame temperature can only be lower in the presence of excess oxygen, as explained earlier. So this option is incorrect.

Hence, the correct answer is (C) lower than 5975 K irrespective of the amount of excess oxygen.
