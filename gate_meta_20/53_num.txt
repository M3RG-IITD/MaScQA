Given: 1. Acceleration due to gravity is 9.8 $m.s^(-2)$. Cross-sectional area of gate is 0.2 $m^2$. In a top gated mold, liquid metal enters the mold cavity as freely falling stream under gravity from a height of 0.5m. Ignore the fluid friction due to viscosity and the drag due to changes in the direction of flow. If the volume of the mold cavity is 10 $m^3$, then the time(in seconds) required to fill the mold is?(roound off to nearest integer)
