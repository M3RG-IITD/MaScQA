We need to match the reactors in Column I with the corresponding products in Column II.

Column I: 
(P) COREX (Q) MIDREX (R) Flash smelting reactor (S) Submerged arc furnace

Column II: 
1. Sponge iron
2. Copper matte
3. Hot metal or pig iron
4. Ferrochrome

Let's analyze each reactor and their corresponding products:

(P) COREX: 
The COREX process is a smelting reduction process used for the production of hot metal, which is a form of pig iron. Therefore, COREX corresponds to product 3, Hot metal or pig iron.

(Q) MIDREX: 
MIDREX is a direct reduction process that uses natural gas to reduce iron ore into sponge iron or direct reduced iron (DRI), which is a form of metallic iron with low carbon content. Therefore, MIDREX corresponds to product 1, Sponge iron.

(R) Flash smelting reactor: 
Flash smelting is a process used in the production of non-ferrous metals, particularly copper. In this process, copper concentrate is reacted with oxygen to produce copper matte, which is a mixture of copper sulfide and iron sulfide. Therefore, Flash smelting reactor corresponds to product 2, Copper matte.

(S) Submerged arc furnace: 
Submerged arc furnaces are used in the production of various ferroalloys, including ferrochrome. Ferrochrome is an alloy of chromium and iron, produced by electric arc carbothermic reduction of chromite. Therefore, Submerged arc furnace corresponds to product 4, Ferrochrome.

Now, let's match the reactors and products:

P - 3, Q - 1, R - 2, S - 4

The correct option is (C).

Answer: [(C) P-3, Q-1, R-2, S-4]
