To solve this problem, we need to use the following formula to find the angle of bite (also known as the angle of wrap or contact angle) in cold-rolling:

tan(α) ≤ μ

where
α = angle of bite (in degrees)
μ = coefficient of friction between sheet and roll (given as 0.1)

First, we need to find the angle in radians by taking the inverse tangent (arctan) of both sides:

α ≤ arctan(μ)
α ≤ arctan(0.1)

Now, we will calculate the arctan(0.1) which will give the value of α in radians:

α ≤ arctan(0.1)
α ≤ 0.0997 radians

Next, we need to convert this radian value into degrees using the following conversion:

1 radian = 180°/π

α ≤ 0.0997 * (180°/π)
α ≤ 5.71°

Finally, we round off the angle to one decimal place:

α ≤ 5.7°

So, the angle of bite should be less than or equal to 5.7 degrees for the sheet to be drawn into rolls in cold-rolling.

The final answer: [5.7°]
