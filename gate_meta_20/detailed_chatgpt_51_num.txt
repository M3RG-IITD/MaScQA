Given: The steady-state creep rate of a material increases by a factor of 20 when the temperature is increased from 890K to 980K. 

Let the steady-state creep rate at 890K be denoted by r1 and the steady-state creep rate at 980K be denoted by r2. 

We know from the question that: 

r2/r1 = 20 

Now we need to find the temperature x such that the creep rate at x is 5 times the creep rate at 890K. Let the creep rate at x be denoted by r3. 

We know that: 

r3/r1 = 5 

We need to find x such that r3 is related to r1 and r2. 

We can use the concept of activation energy to relate r1 and r2: 

ln(r2/r1) = Q/RT * (1/T1 - 1/T2) 

where Q is the activation energy, R is the gas constant, T1 and T2 are the temperatures in Kelvin, and ln denotes the natural logarithm. 

Taking logarithm on both sides of r2/r1 = 20, we get: 

ln(20) = Q/R * (1/890 - 1/980) 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

Q = ln(20) * R * (1/890 - 1/980) 

Now we can use Q and the given relationship between r3 and r1 to find x. 

ln(r3/r1) = Q/RT * (1/T1 - 1/Tx) 

Substituting the values we know, we get: 

ln(5) = Q/R * (1/890 - 1/x) 

Solving for x, we have: 

x = 1/(1/890 - ln(5) * R/Q) 

Substituting the values we know, we get: 

x = 713 K (rounded off to the nearest integer) 

Therefore, the temperature at which the creep rate is 5 times the creep rate at 890K is 713K. 

Answer: 

- 713 K
