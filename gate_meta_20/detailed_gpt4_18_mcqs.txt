Step 1: Understand the question
The question asks to identify the type of material produced by a Cupola furnace. We are given four options: cast irons, plain carbon steels, copper alloys, and aluminum alloys.

Step 2: Know what a Cupola furnace is
A Cupola furnace is a type of shaft or vertical furnace used to melt metals and create metal castings. The furnace has layers of alternating fuel (usually coke) and a mixture of metal, limestone, and other flux materials.

Step 3: Determine the material produced by a Cupola furnace
Cupola furnaces are primarily designed for melting cast iron, which is a process for producing iron by re-melting pig iron in a refractory-lined furnace known as a cupola.

Step 4: Eliminate the incorrect options

A) Cast irons: As mentioned above, Cupola furnaces are mainly used to produce cast iron.

B) Plain carbon steels: Cupola furnaces are not used to produce plain carbon steels, as the temperature generated in these furnaces is not high enough to melt steel.

C) Copper alloys: Cupola furnaces are also not used to produce copper alloys, as the melting temperatures of copper alloys are different from cast iron, and the furnaces are not designed for this process.

D) Aluminum alloys: Cupola furnaces are not used to produce aluminum alloys, as aluminum alloys require different melting temperatures and production methods than cast iron.

Step 5: List the correct answer
Based on the information above, the correct answer is (A) cast irons. The Cupola furnace is primarily used to produce cast irons.
