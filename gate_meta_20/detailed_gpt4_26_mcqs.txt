To determine the stability of dislocation Z in positions 1, 2, and 3, we must consider the forces acting on it due to dislocations X and Y. These forces will either attract or repel Z, depending on their net effect. 

The force between two edge dislocations with identical Burgers vectors is repulsive if they are on the same slip plane, and attractive if they are on different slip planes. For dislocations X and Y, since they are fixed and separated by 2h on the same slip plane, they will generate repulsive forces. 

Now let's consider the forces acting on dislocation Z in positions 1, 2, and 3. 

Position 1:
In this position, dislocation Z is equidistant from dislocations X and Y, and it is in the same slip plane as them. Dislocation X and Y generate repulsive forces on Z, which cancel each other since Z is in the middle. This means there is no net force acting on dislocation Z, which results in an unstable equilibrium. The slightest disturbance can cause Z to move away from this position. Thus, position 1 is an unstable equilibrium.

Position 2:
In this position, dislocation Z is directly above dislocation X in a parallel slip plane. This results in attractive forces between Z and both X and Y, causing it to be more stable than position 1. However, dislocation X is closer to Z as compared to dislocation Y, and hence the attractive force due to X is much more significant. This causes a net force towards dislocation X and results in instability. Thus, position 2 is unstable.

Position 3:
In this position, dislocation Z is exactly between dislocations X and Y in a parallel slip plane. Since both X and Y are equidistant from Z, the attractive forces from both dislocations have the same magnitude, which results in a net force of zero. This equilibrium position is stable, and any small disturbance will cause dislocation Z to be attracted back to this position. Thus, position 3 is stable.

In conclusion, the correct answer is (D) Position 1: stable equilibrium; Position 2: unstable; Position 3: stable.
