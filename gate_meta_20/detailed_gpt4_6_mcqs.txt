Selective leaching is a process that occurs in alloys where one of the metal components is preferentially removed from the alloy through corrosion or other chemical reactions, leaving behind a porous structure that often has reduced mechanical strength. This process is also known as dealloying or parting.

Now let's examine each statement.

(A) The lower atomic weight element is leached: Selective leaching is not directly based on atomic weight. It is mainly dependent on electrochemical and thermodynamic factors.

(B) The element having higher diffusivity is leached: While diffusivity can play a role in the migration of elements during selective leaching, it is not the primary determining factor. Electrochemical and thermodynamic factors are more relevant.

(C) The more electronegative element is leached: This statement is correct. Selective leaching primarily depends on the electrochemical potential difference between the alloying elements, where the more electronegative or more reactive element is preferentially removed from the alloy. This is because the more electronegative element can form a more stable oxide or compound when it comes in contact with the corroding medium, promoting selective leaching.

(D) The element with lower density is leached: Density does not directly determine the selective leaching of elements in a binary alloy. Electrochemical and thermodynamic factors are more important.

In conclusion, the correct answer is:
[C] The more electronegative element is leached
