To solve this problem, we need to first understand what an isotropic material is and what elastic constants are, and then find out how many independent elastic constants are there for such a material.

An isotropic material is a material that has the same properties in all directions. In other words, the material behaves the same way, regardless of the direction of the applied force or whether it's being compressed or expanded, etc.

Elastic constants are the parameters that describe how a material responds to forces or deformation. They are used to describe the relationships between stress and strain in the material. The most common elastic constants are Young's modulus (E), shear modulus (G), and bulk modulus (K).

Now, let's find out the number of independent elastic constants for an isotropic material.

In general, there are 6 independent elastic constants needed to describe the material behavior of an anisotropic (non-uniform) material. These are the three normal (Young's modulus, E), three shear (Shear modulus, G), and three bulk (Bulk modulus, K) constants.

However, for isotropic materials, the number of independent elastic constants is reduced due to the fact that some of these constants are related to one another. The relationship between elastic constants can be given by:

1. E = 2G(1 + ν)
2. E = 3K(1 - 2ν)
3. G = 3K(1 - 2ν) / 2(1 + ν)

where ν is Poisson's ratio.

As you can see, there are three equations that define the relationship between the elastic constants. So, in this case, we only need two independent elastic constants to describe the behavior of an isotropic material. We can derive the third constant from any of the two constants using these equations.

Therefore, the number of independent elastic constants for an isotropic material is 2 (Option B).

To summarize:

An isotropic material has the same properties in all directions. Elastic constants describe how a material responds to forces or deformation. Generally, for an anisotropic material, we have 6 independent elastic constants, but for an isotropic material, some of the constants are related, and we only need 2 independent elastic constants. Thus, the correct answer is 2 (Option B).
