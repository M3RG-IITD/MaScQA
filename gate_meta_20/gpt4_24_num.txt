The angle of bite can be found using the equation:

angle of bite ≤ 2 × arctan(μ)

where μ is the coefficient of friction.

Plugging in the given coefficient of friction (0.1):

angle of bite ≤ 2 × arctan(0.1)

Calculating the arctan(0.1) and converting the result to degrees:

arctan(0.1) ≈ 0.1 radians
angle of bite ≤ 2 × (0.1 × (180 / π))
angle of bite ≤ 2 × (5.7)

Therefore, the angle of bite should be less than or equal to:

angle of bite ≤ 11.4 degrees

Rounded off to one decimal place: [11.4]
