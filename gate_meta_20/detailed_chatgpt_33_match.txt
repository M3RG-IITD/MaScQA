Column I: 

- (P) COREX
- (Q) MIDREX
- (R) Flash smelting reactor
- (S) Submerged arc furnace

Column II:

- 1. Sponge iron
- 2. Copper matte
- 3. Hot metal or pig iron
- 4. Ferrochrome

Explanation:

- COREX is a smelting reduction process that produces hot metal or pig iron by directly reducing iron ore in a shaft furnace using non-coking coal. Therefore, P corresponds to 3.
- MIDREX is a process in which iron ore pellets are reduced in a vertical shaft furnace by means of a reduction gas derived from natural gas. Sponge iron is the product. Therefore, Q corresponds to 1.
- Flash smelting is a smelting process for sulfur-containing ores, including chalcopyrite. Copper matte is the product. Therefore, R corresponds to 2.
- Submerged arc furnace is used for the production of ferroalloys, including ferrochrome. Ferrochrome is the product. Therefore, S corresponds to 4.

The correct answer is (D) P-3, Q-1, R-4, S-2.
