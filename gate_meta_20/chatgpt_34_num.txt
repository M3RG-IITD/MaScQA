We know that for a FCC crystal,

d = a/√2, where d is the distance between the crystal planes and a is the lattice parameter.

Also, for a diffraction peak, we have the Bragg's law: nλ = 2dsinθ, where n is the order of the reflection, λ is the wavelength of the X-ray and θ is the Bragg angle.

From the given data, we can calculate the d value using Bragg's law:

nλ = 2dsinθ
1(0.1543nm) = 2d(sin24.65°)
d = 0.1543nm/(2sin24.65°) = 0.262nm

Now, using the equation for FCC lattice, we can calculate a:
d = a/√2
a = d * √2 = 0.262nm * √2 = 0.370nm

Therefore, the lattice parameter of the metal is 0.370 nm.

Answer: (D) 0.370
