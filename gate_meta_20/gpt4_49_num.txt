Let x be the weight of the slag needed.

Initially, the weight of the sulphur in steel is 0.03% * 1000 kg = 0.3 kg S.

After desulphurization, the weight of sulphur in steel is 0.015% * 1000 kg = 0.15 kg S.

Thus, 0.15 kg of sulphur has been transferred to the slag.

Since the equilibrium sulphur partition ratio is 50, the weight of sulphur in the slag is 50 times the remaining sulphur content in the steel. That is:

(wt.%S) in slag = 50 * (wt.%S) in steel after desulphurization
(wt.%S) in slag = 50 * 0.015 = 0.750

Now we can find the weight of slag needed:

x * 0.750 = 0.15 kg S
x = 0.15 kg S / 0.750
x = 0.2 kg

Therefore, the quantity of slag needed is approximately 0.2 kg, rounded off to the nearest integer: [0].
