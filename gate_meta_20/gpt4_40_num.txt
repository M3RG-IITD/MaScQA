In the hard sphere model, the interstitial atom will fit into the octahedral void without distorting the lattice if the sum of its radius and the radius of the Fe atom does not exceed half the diagonal of the unit cell. 

In a BCC lattice, the body diagonal can be related to the edge length "a" as follows:

diagonal^2 = a^2 + a^2 + a^2
diagonal = a * √3

The edge length can be related to the diameter of an Fe atom, which is twice its radius:

a = 4 * radius_Fe

Now, let's find "a":

radius_Fe = 0.124 nm
a = 4 * 0.124 = 0.496 nm

Now, we can find the length of the diagonal:

diagonal = a * √3 = 0.496 * √3 = 0.859 nm

The sum of the radius of the largest interstitial atom(radius_I) and the radius of the Fe atom should not exceed half the length of the diagonal:

radius_I + radius_Fe = 0.859 / 2

Now, let's find the radius_I:

radius_I = (0.859 / 2) - radius_Fe = 0.859/2 - 0.124 = 0.4305 - 0.124 = 0.3065 nm

Therefore, the radius of the largest interstitial atom that can be accommodated in an octahedral void in BCC iron without distorting the lattice is approximately 0.307 nm (rounded off to three decimal places). The answer should be written inside a list as follows:

[0.307]
