We can use Torricelli's theorem to solve this problem.

Torricelli's theorem states that the velocity of a fluid, flowing out of an opening in a tank containing the fluid, is equal to the velocity which a freely falling body would acquire if it fell from a height equal to the distance between the opening and the free surface of the fluid.

In this case, the opening is the gate through which the liquid metal enters the mold cavity, and the free surface of the fluid is the surface of the liquid in the gate. The height from which the liquid falls into the mold cavity is given as 0.5m.

Using Torricelli's theorem, we can write:

v = sqrt(2gh)

where v is the velocity of the liquid as it enters the mold cavity, g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.8 $m.s^{-2}$), and h is the height from which the liquid falls (0.5m).

Substituting the values, we get:

v = sqrt(2*9.8*0.5) = 3.13 m/s

The volume of the mold cavity is given as 10 $m^3$, and the cross-sectional area of the gate is 0.2 $m^2$. The volume flow rate can be calculated as:

Q = A*v

where Q is the volume flow rate, A is the cross-sectional area of the gate, and v is the velocity of the liquid.

Substituting the values, we get:

Q = 0.2*3.13 = 0.626 $m^3/s$

The time required to fill the mold can be calculated as:

t = V/Q

where t is the time, V is the volume of the mold cavity, and Q is the volume flow rate.

Substituting the values, we get:

t = 10/0.626 = 15.98 s

Rounding off to the nearest integer, we get:

t = 16 s

Therefore, the time required to fill the mold is 16 seconds.
