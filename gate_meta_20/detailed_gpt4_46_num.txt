Given:

1. Incompressible flow with no friction losses.
2. Density of air: ρ_air = 1 kg/m^3
3. Density of water: ρ_water = 1000 kg/m^3
4. Acceleration due to gravity: g = 9.8 m/s^2
5. Cross-sectional area at A: A1 = 100 mm^2 = 100 * 10^(-6) m^2
6. Cross-sectional area at B: A2 = 50 mm^2 = 50 * 10^(-6) m^2
7. The flow rate (Q) is given to be 10^(-3) m^3/s

The principle employed in solving this problem is the continuity equation and Bernoulli's equation.

Continuity equation: Q = A1 * v1 = A2 * v2

We can find the velocities at points A and B.

v1 = Q / A1
v1 = (10^(-3) m^3/s) / (100 * 10^(-6) m^2) = 10 m/s

Similarly,

v2 = Q / A2
v2 = (10^(-3) m^3/s) / (50 * 10^(-6) m^2) = 20 m/s

Now, let's use the Bernoulli's equation:

P1 + (1/2) * ρ_air * v1^2 + ρ_air * g * h1 = P2 + (1/2) * ρ_air * v2^2 + ρ_air * g * h2

Since the pressure at the same height in the manometer is the same, we have:

P1 + ρ_air * g * h1 = P2 + ρ_air * g * h2
=> P1 - P2 = ρ_air * g * (h2 - h1)
=> P1 - P2 = ρ_air * g * H, where H = (h2 - h1)

We can substitute the Bernoulli's equation to obtain the above equation:

ρ_air * g * H = (1/2) * ρ_air * v2^2 - (1/2) * ρ_air * v1^2
=> H = [(1/2) * v2^2 - (1/2) * v1^2] / g
=> H = [(1/2) * (20 m/s)^2 - (1/2) * (10 m/s)^2] / (9.8 m/s^2)

Solving for H,

=> H = (200 - 50) / 9.8
=> H = 150 / 9.8
=> H = 15.306 m

Since we need the height H in millimeters, we convert it:

H = 15.306 m * 1000 = 15,306 mm

Rounded off to the nearest integer, H = 15306.

The height H in the air-over-water manometer is approximately 15306mm. 

Answer: [15306]
