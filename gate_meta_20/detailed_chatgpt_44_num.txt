The parabolic rate law is given as:

$w^2 = kt$

where:

$w$ = oxide thickness
$k$ = parabolic rate constant
$t$ = time

First, we need to convert the thickness of the oxide film from micrometer $(µm)$ to centimeter $(cm)$:

$1 µm = 10^{-4} cm$

Therefore, the thickness of the oxide film in centimeters is:

$w = 2 µm * 10^{-4} = 2 * 10^{-4} cm$

Substituting the given values in the parabolic rate law, we get:

$(2 * 10^{-4})^2 = 3 * 10^{-6} * t$

Solving for $t$:

$t = \frac{(2 * 10^{-4})^2}{3 * 10^{-6}}$

$t = \frac{4 * 10^{-8}}{3 * 10^{-6}}$

$t = 0.0133 s$

Therefore, the time taken for the oxide film to grow to a thickness of 2 µm is 0.01 seconds (rounded off to two decimal places).

Answer: [0.01]
