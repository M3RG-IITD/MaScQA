We have the parabolic rate constant k_p = 3 * $10^(-6) g^(2).cm^(-4).s^(-1)$ (units are important). 

We know that the oxide film grows in a parabolic manner. The equation for the growth of the oxide film is:

x^2 = k_p * t / (ρ * M)

where x is the thickness of the oxide film, t is the time taken for the film to grow to that thickness, ρ is the density of the oxide, and M is the molar mass.

We are given the thickness x = 2 µm = 2 * $10^(-4) cm$, and the density ρ = 6.5 $g.cm^(-3)$. To solve for time t, we'll assume that the molar mass M of the oxide is constant during the process (since it doesn't affect the proportionality).

x^2 = (k_p * t) / (ρ * M)

t = (x^2 * ρ * M) / k_p

t = ((2 * $10^(-4) cm)^2 * 6.5 $g.cm^(-3)$ * M) / (3 * $10^(-6) g^(2).cm^(-4).s^(-1)$)

t ≈ (8 * $10^(-8) cm^2$$ * 6.5 $g.cm^(-3)$ * M) / (3 * $10^(-6) g^(2).cm^(-4).s^(-1)$)

t ≈ 2.167 * $10^(-1) M s$

Since the molar mass M is constant, we can just approximate the value of t:

t ≈ 2.17 * $10^(-1) M s$

We approximate the time taken for the oxide film to grow to a thickness of 2 µm as:

t ≈ 0.217 M seconds

We'll round off to two decimal places inside the list: [0.22 M]
