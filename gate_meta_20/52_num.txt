Crack growth is being continuously measured in a test specimen subjected to constant amplitude cyclic stress with a mean stress of zero. The crack growth rate is related to the stress intensity range, ΔK as da/dN ∝ $(ΔK)^(3)$, where, a is the crack lenght and N is the number of cycles. When the crack length increases by a factor of two, the crack growth rate will increase by a factor of?(round off to one decimal place).
