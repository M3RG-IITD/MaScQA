To find the Nickel content in the weld pool, we need to consider the contribution of dilution from each plate as well as the filler rod. 

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Calculate the contribution of each element from Plate 1:

Composition of Plate 1: Fe-10 wt.% Ni
Dilution from Plate 1: 20%

Ni contribution from Plate 1 = 10 wt.% Ni * 20% = 2 wt.% Ni

2. Calculate the contribution of each element from Plate 2:

Composition of Plate 2: Fe-20 wt.% Cr-5 wt.% Ni
Dilution from Plate 2: 20%

Ni contribution from Plate 2 = 5 wt.% Ni * 20% = 1 wt.% Ni

3. Calculate the contribution of each element from the filler rod:

Composition of filler rod: 20 wt.% Ni-80 wt.% Cr
Dilution from filler rod: 100% - (20% + 20%) = 60%

Ni contribution from filler rod = 20 wt.% Ni * 60% = 12 wt.% Ni

4. Add up the contributions of Nickel from each source:

Total Ni content in the weld pool = Ni from Plate 1 + Ni from Plate 2 + Ni from filler rod
Total Ni content = 2 wt.% Ni + 1 wt.% Ni + 12 wt.% Ni
Total Ni content = 15 wt.% Ni

Round off to the nearest integer:

Ni content in the weld pool = 15 wt.% Ni

The Nickel content in the weld pool is approximately 15 wt.%.
