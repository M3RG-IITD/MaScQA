Answer: (A) Both [a] and [r] are true and [r] is the correct reason for [a].

Explanation:
Low alloy steels used for medium-temperature creep resistance often contain additions of strong carbide-forming elements such as chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, and vanadium. These elements form carbides that act as obstacles to dislocation movement, thereby increasing the strength and creep resistance of the steel.

During creep deformation, the steel is subjected to sustained loading and high temperatures, which cause the steel to deform plastically over time. This deformation is caused by the movement of dislocations through the crystal lattice of the steel. The strong carbide-forming elements in the steel act as obstacles to this dislocation movement, which helps prevent excessive deformation and creep.

The reason given in [r] is also correct. As the steel deforms, the particles with higher misfit with the matrix (i.e. the carbide particles) lose their coherency, which means they become less well-defined and less effective at hindering dislocation movement. This can lead to a weakening of the steel over time.

Therefore, both [a] and [r] are true, and [r] is the correct reason for [a].
