In cold-rolling process, the sheet is drawn into rolls by applying force to reduce the thickness of the sheet. To achieve this, the sheet is passed through a set of rollers which apply pressure and pull the sheet through.

The angle of contact, also known as the angle of bite, is the angle between the incoming sheet and the tangent to the roll at the point of contact. This angle plays an important role in determining the force required to pull the sheet through the rollers.

The coefficient of friction between the sheet and the roll is given as 0.1. We can use this value to calculate the maximum angle of contact for cold-rolling.

The maximum angle of contact is given by:

$\theta_{max} = \arctan(\mu)$

where $\mu$ is the coefficient of friction.

Substituting the given value of $\mu = 0.1$ into the above formula, we get:

$\theta_{max} = \arctan(0.1) \approx 5.7^\circ$

Therefore, the angle of contact (or angle of bite) should be less than or equal to approximately 5.7 degrees in cold-rolling.

Answer: 
- 5.7 degrees
