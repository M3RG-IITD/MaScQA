Superplasticity is the ability of a material to undergo extensive plastic deformation without breaking or fracturing under conditions such as high temperature and specific deformation rates. This property is usually observed in certain metals and alloys that exhibit large elongation when subjected to tensile loads.

To exhibit superplastic behavior, a material must satisfy several requirements:
1. Fine-grained microstructure
2. High strain-rate sensitivity
3. Low-strain hardening exponent
4. Stable grain growth during deformation

Now, let's discuss these requirements in detail and analyze each option.

(A) Coarse-grained microstructure
This statement is opposite to the actual requirement because superplastic behavior requires a fine-grained microstructure. Materials with fine grains exhibit better ductility due to the increased number of grain boundaries that can accommodate deformation. Fine grains also help in maintaining the stability of grain growth during deformation.

(B) High strain-rate sensitivity
This requirement is true. Strain-rate sensitivity (SRS) is the ability of a material to deform plastically at different rates depending on the applied stress. Superplastically deforming materials exhibit a high SRS value, typically greater than 0.3. This characteristic allows the material to flow and redistribute stress heterogeneities that usually lead to localized necking or cracking. Higher SRS values contribute to increased ductility and deformation capability in metals.

(C) Low strain-hardening exponent
This requirement is also true. Strain-hardening is the process by which metals become stronger as they are deformed plastically. In materials showing superplastic behavior, the strain-hardening exponent must be low. The low strain-hardening exponent ensures that the rate of hardening is minimal during deformation, which helps maintain the ductility and extending capabilities of the material.

(D) High modulus of elasticity
This statement is not relevant to superplastic behavior. The modulus of elasticity is a measure of the stiffness of a material, and it is not related to a material's deformation ability or ductility. Therefore, the modulus of elasticity is not a determining factor for superplastic behavior.

In conclusion, from the given options, the correct answer is:

[ (B) High strain-rate sensitivity, (C) Low strain-hardening exponent ]
