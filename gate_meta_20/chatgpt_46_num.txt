Since the flow is incompressible and there are no friction losses, we can apply Bernoulli's equation along a streamline. Let's assume the streamline follows the shape of the venturi tube.

At point A, the pressure is $P_A$, the velocity is $v_A$, and the cross-sectional area is $A_A = 100\ mm^2$. At point B, the pressure is $P_B$, the velocity is $v_B$, and the cross-sectional area is $A_B = 50\ mm^2$.

According to Bernoulli's equation:

$$P_A + \frac{1}{2}\rho v_A^2 + \rho g h = P_B + \frac{1}{2}\rho v_B^2$$

where $\rho$ is the density of the fluid, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $h$ is the height of the air-over-water manometer.

Since the flow is incompressible, the mass flow rate at A must be equal to the mass flow rate at B:

$$\rho v_A A_A = \rho v_B A_B$$

Substituting $A_A = 100\ mm^2$ and $A_B = 50\ mm^2$, and solving for $v_B$, we get:

$$v_B = 2v_A$$

Substituting this into Bernoulli's equation, we get:

$$P_A + \frac{1}{2}\rho v_A^2 + \rho g h = P_B + 2\frac{1}{2}\rho v_A^2$$

Simplifying and rearranging, we get:

$$h = \frac{(P_A - P_B)}{\rho g} + \frac{3}{2}\frac{v_A^2}{g}$$

We don't know $P_A$ and $P_B$, but we can use the air-over-water manometer to find the pressure difference. The pressure difference is the same as the weight difference between the two columns of fluid. Since the densities of air and water are known, we can calculate the weight of each column:

$$\text{pressure difference} = \text{weight difference} = \rho_{water} g (h_{right} - h_{left}) - \rho_{air} g H$$

We can rearrange this equation to solve for $H$:

$$H = \frac{\rho_{water}}{\rho_{air}}(h_{right} - h_{left}) - \frac{\text{pressure difference}}{\rho_{air} g}$$

We're given that the density of air is 1 $kg/m^3$ and the density of water is 1000 $kg/m^3$. Converting the cross-sectional areas to $m^2$ and the flow rate to $m^3/s$, we get:

$$A_A = 1\times10^{-4}\ m^2,\quad A_B = 5\times10^{-5}\ m^2,\quad \dot{V} = 10^{-3}\ m^3/s$$

The flow velocity at point A is:

$$v_A = \frac{\dot{V}}{A_A} = \frac{10^{-3}\ m^3/s}{1\times10^{-4}\ m^2} = 10\ m/s$$

The flow velocity at point B is:

$$v_B = 2v_A = 20\ m/s$$

We need to calculate the pressure difference or the weight difference. Let's start by calculating the weight difference. The area of the cross section of the manometer tube is 10 $mm^2$, so the weight difference per unit length is:

$$\Delta w = (\rho_{water} - \rho_{air}) g \times 10\ mm^2 = 9.8\times10^3\ N/m^3 \times (10^{-6}\ m^2) = 0.0098\ N/m$$

The weight difference between the two columns of fluid is the distance between them times $\Delta w$. We can estimate the distance between the two columns to be around $10\ mm$. Therefore, the weight difference is:

$$\text{weight difference} = 10\ mm \times 0.0098\ N/m = 0.098\ N$$

The pressure difference is the weight difference divided by the cross-sectional area of the manometer tube:

$$\text{pressure difference} = \frac{0.098\ N}{10^{-5}\ m^2} = 9800\ Pa$$

Now we can calculate $H$:

$$H = \frac{1000}{1}(h_{right} - h_{left}) - \frac{9800\ Pa}{1\times9.8\ m/s^2} = 1020 - 1000 = 20\ mm$$

Therefore, the height $H$ in the air-over-water manometer is 20 mm (rounded off to the nearest integer).
