According to the given information, we can write:

da/dN ∝ $(ΔK)^{3}$

We can write the above equation in terms of proportions as:

da/dN ∝ ΔK^{3}

This means that crack growth rate is directly proportional to (ΔK)^(3).

Now, according to the question, the crack length has increased by a factor of 2. This means that the final crack length is twice the initial crack length. Let's denote the initial crack length and growth rate as a and da/dN respectively, and the final crack length and growth rate as 2a and 2x(da/dN) respectively.

Now, we know that:

da/dN ∝ ΔK^{3}

Let's assume that the stress intensity factor range (ΔK) remains constant. This means that ΔK is constant for both initial and final lengths of the crack.

Thus, we can write:

da/dN α ΔK^{3}    (where α denotes proportionality)

For initial crack length (a), we can write:

da/dN = α(ΔK)^{3}

For final crack length (2a), we can write:

2x(da/dN) = 2xα(ΔK)^{3}

Simplifying the above equation, we get:

2x(da/dN) = α(ΔK)^{3} x 2^{3}

2x(da/dN) = α(ΔK)^{3} x 8

2x(da/dN) = 8(da/dN)

x = 4

Therefore, when the crack length increases by a factor of two, the crack growth rate will increase by a factor of 4.
