Isotropic materials have the same properties in all directions. Therefore, their elastic behavior is described by only two types of deformation: tension (or compression), and shear. The relationship between the stress and strain components can be represented by Hooke's law, which is a linear relationship between the two. 

For isotropic materials, the relationship between the stress and strain can be simplified to the following:

σij = Cijklεkl

where σij is the stress tensor, εkl is the strain tensor, and Cijkl are the elastic constants. Since the material is isotropic, the values of the elastic constants will be the same when i and j and k and l are swapped. This means that the total number of independent elastic constants is 21, but due to symmetry, it reduces to 6. 

The six independent elastic constants can be further reduced to only two by using the following relations:

C1111 = C2222 = C3333 = C1122 = C1133 = C2233
C1212 = C1313 = C2323 = (C1111 – C1122)/2
C44 = (C1111 – C1212)/2

Therefore, the number of independent elastic constants for isotropic materials is (B) 2.
