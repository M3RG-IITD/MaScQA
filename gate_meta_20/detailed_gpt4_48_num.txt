To find the driving force for the liquid to transform to solid, we can use the Gibbs free energy equation, which is given by:

ΔG = ΔH - TΔS

where ΔG is the change in Gibbs free energy, ΔH is the change in enthalpy (in this case, the enthalpy of melting), T is the temperature in Kelvin, and ΔS is the change in entropy. 

Since we are considering the melting process, we can relate the enthalpy change (ΔH) and entropy change (ΔS) as:

ΔH = T_m * ΔS

where T_m is the melting temperature of copper.

Now, we need to find the change in entropy (ΔS) for the melting process:

ΔS = ΔH / T_m

ΔS = 13 * 1000 J/mol / 1356 K

ΔS ≈ 9.587 J/(mol*K)

Now, we can find the Gibbs free energy (ΔG) for the cooling process, where the temperature is 1353 K:

ΔG = ΔH - T*ΔS

ΔG = 13 * 1000 J/mol - 1353 K * 9.587 J/(mol*K)

ΔG ≈ 13,000 J/mol - (1353 * 9.587) J/mol

ΔG ≈ 13,000 J/mol - 12,976.1 J/mol

ΔG ≈ 23.9 J/mol

Therefore, the magnitude of the driving force for liquid copper to transform to solid at 1353 K is approximately 23.9 J/mol.

The answer is: [23.9]
