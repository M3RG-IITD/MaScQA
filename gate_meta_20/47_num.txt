Assume: (1. There is no slip between the ball and the mill wall. 2. O is the rotational axis of the mill and OB is parallel to the vector g. 3. Inner diameter of ball mill is 3.26m. 4. Acceleration due to gravity g is 9.8 $m.s^(-2)$. For effective communition in a ball mill, it is desired that the balls travelling along the mill wall leave the wall at point C and travel freely in air along the path CDA, as shown in the figure. If ∠BOC is 120°, the rotational speed(in rpm) of the mill is?(round off to one decimal places) by performing suitable force balance at point C. Refer the image.
