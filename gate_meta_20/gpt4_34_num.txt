We can use Bragg's Law to solve this problem, which states: 

n * λ = 2 * d * sin(θ)

where n is an integer, λ is the wavelength of the X-ray, d is the interplanar spacing between crystal planes, and θ is the Bragg angle.

Since it's an elemental metal with an FCC crystal structure and the first peak shown, we can assume n = 1. The question gives us λ = 0.1543 nm and θ = 24.65°. Let's find the interplanar spacing (d) first:

1 * 0.1543 = 2 * d * sin(24.65°)
d = 0.1543 / (2 * sin(24.65°))

Now, in an FCC crystal structure, the lattice parameter (a) and the interplanar spacing (d) are related by the following equation for the {111} planes which give the first peak:

a^2 = d^2 * (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)

where h, k, and l are Miller indices. In our case, the first diffraction peak corresponds to the {111} planes, so we have:

a^2 = d^2 * (1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2)

Solving for the lattice parameter a:

a = sqrt(d^2 * 3)

Now substituting the value of d from the previous step:

a = sqrt((0.1543 / (2 * sin(24.65°)))^2 * 3)

a ≈ 0.362 nm

The given options do not have the exact value, but option (D) 0.370 nm is the closest. Therefore, we can choose this as the correct answer.

So, the lattice parameter (a) is approximately 0.370 nm. The correct answer is: [(D)].
