Assume: 1. Thermodynamic equilibrium. 2. No sulphur in the slag prior to desulphurization treatment. Given the equilibrium sulphur partition ratio between slag and steel, [(wt.%S)in slag]/[(wt.%S) in steel] is 50. 1000kg of liquid steel containing 0.03 wt.% S needs to be desulphurized using a slag to bring the sulphur content down to 0.015 wt.%. The quantity(in kg) of slag needed is?(round off to the nearest integer).
