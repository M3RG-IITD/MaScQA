We are given the Anodic Tafel Slope, diffusion coefficient of oxygen, diffusion layer thickness, and dissolved oxygen concentration. We need to find the anodic current density at an overpotential of 120 mV. 

First, let's convert the overpotential from mV to V:

Overpotential = 120 mV × (1 V / 1000 mV) = 0.120 V

Now we can use the Anodic Tafel equation:

$η = β_a log(i_a/i_0)$

Where:
$η$ - overpotential (0.120 V)
$β_a$ - Anodic Tafel slope (0.06 V)
$i_a$ - Anodic current density (what we want to find)
$i_0$ - Exchange current density

We need to find the exchange current density ($i_0$) in order to solve for the anodic current density ($i_a$).

To find $i_0$, we can use the following equation:

$i_0 = n.F.C_d.D^(1/2).δ^(-1/2)$

Where:
$n$ - number of electrons transferred (since it's an oxygen reduction reaction, n = 4)
$F$ - Faraday's constant (96485 C/mol)
$C_d$ - dissolved oxygen concentration (15 mM = 0.015 mol/L)
$D$ - diffusion coefficient of oxygen (2.42e-5 $cm^2/s$)
$δ$ - diffusion layer thickness (0.06 cm)

Now we can plug all these values into the equation and find $i_0$:

$i_0 = 4 × 96485 × 0.015 × (2.42 × 10^-5)^(1/2) × (0.06)^(-1/2)$
$i_0 ≈ 2.00 A/cm^2$

Now that we have $i_0$, we can use the Anodic Tafel equation to find $i_a$:

$η = β_a log(i_a/i_0)$
$0.120 = 0.06 × log(i_a / 2.00)$

Solving for $i_a$:

$i_a = 2.00 × 10^(0.120 / 0.06)$
$i_a ≈ 3.981 A/cm^2$

Rounded to three decimal places, the anodic current density at an overpotential of 120 mV is 3.981 $A/cm^2$. 

So the answer is [3.981].
