Given: 
Atomic weight of Sn = 118.7
Atomic weight of Mg = 24.3
Mg-Sn phase diagram: 
Eutectic 1: L(36.9 wt.% Sn) → α(14.48 wt.% Sn) + $Mg_2Sn$ at 561°C
Eutectic 2: L (97.87 wt.% Sn) → β-Sn (almost 100 wt.% Sn) + $Mg_2Sn$ at 203°C

We need to determine the amount of eutectic constituent present in the alloy, Mg-50 wt.% Sn, just below 561°C.

First, we need to determine the composition of the alloy, Mg-50 wt.% Sn. 

Atomic weight of Mg = 24.3
Atomic weight of Sn = 118.7

Let's assume that we have 100 g of the alloy. 
Thus, we have 50 g Mg and 50 g Sn in the alloy. 

Number of moles of Mg: (50 g Mg) / (24.3 g/mol) = 2.06 mol
Number of moles of Sn: (50 g Sn) / (118.7 g/mol) = 0.42 mol

Total moles in the alloy = 2.06 + 0.42 = 2.48 mol

Weight % of Mg in the alloy = (2.06 mol Mg) / (2.48 mol total) x 100% = 83.06%
Weight % of Sn in the alloy = (0.42 mol Sn) / (2.48 mol total) x 100% = 16.94%

Now, let's consider the eutectic reaction that occurs just below 561°C:
L(36.9 wt.% Sn) → α(14.48 wt.% Sn) + $Mg_2Sn$

The eutectic reaction means that at this particular temperature, the liquid phase (L) will transform into two solid phases, one phase with a lower Sn content (α) and the other phase with a higher Sn content ($Mg_2Sn$). The weight percentages of these solid phases can be calculated using the lever rule:

Weight % of α phase = (wt.% Sn in L - wt.% Sn in $Mg_2Sn$) / (wt.% Sn in α - wt.% Sn in $Mg_2Sn$) x 100%
= (36.9 - 0) / (14.48 - 0) x 100% = 254.36%

Weight % of $Mg_2Sn$ phase = 100% - weight % of α phase
= 100% - 254.36% = -154.36%

This result indicates that the weight percentage of the α phase is greater than 100% and the weight percentage of $Mg_2Sn$ is negative, which is not possible. 

Therefore, we can assume that the alloy is outside the two-phase (L + α + $Mg_2Sn$) region in the Mg-Sn phase diagram just below 561°C. This means that the alloy will only contain the α phase and no eutectic constituent. 

Thus, the amount of eutectic constituent present in the alloy, Mg-50 wt.% Sn, is approximately 0 wt.%.
