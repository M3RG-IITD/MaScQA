To find the electrical conductivity of zone refined Si, we will first determine the concentration of P dopant atoms in Si. Then, we will use this concentration to find the number of free electrons per unit volume. Finally, we will use the formula for electrical conductivity to find the desired value.

Step 1: Calculate concentration of P dopant atoms in Si
Given that the residual P content is 0.1 parts per billion by weight, this means that for every 1 billion atoms of Si, there are 0.1 P atoms.

Step 2: Determine the number of Si atoms per unit volume
The density of Si is given as 2.33 g/cm³. We can use this to find the number of Si atoms per unit volume.
Number of Si atoms = (density * volume) / atomic weight of Si
First, we need to find the atomic weight of Si. From the periodic table, the atomic weight of Si is approximately 28 g/mol. Now we calculate the number of Si atoms in unit volume:
(2.33 g/cm³ * 1 cm³) / (28 g/mol) = 0.0832 mol/cm³ of Si atoms

Now convert this to atoms per unit volume using Avogadro's number:
Number of Si atoms per cm³ = 0.0832 mol/cm³ * 6.02 * 10^23 atoms/mol = 5.01 *10^22 atoms/cm³

Step 3: Find the number of P atoms per unit volume
We know that the concentration of P atoms is 0.1 parts per billion by weight:
Number of P atoms per unit volume = (number of Si atoms per unit volume) * (0.1 / 1,000,000,000)
= 5.01 * 10^22 atoms/cm³ * (0.1 / 1,000,000,000) = 5.01 * 10^13 atoms/cm³

Step 4: Calculate the number of free electrons per unit volume
Given that each P atom donates one free electron in Si (n-type doping), we can assume that the number of free electrons per unit volume is equal to the number of P atoms per unit volume. Thus, the number of free electrons per unit volume is equal to 5.01 * 10^13 cm^(-3).

Step 5: Calculate electrical conductivity
The electrical conductivity is given by the formula:
σ = n * e * μ
where σ is the electrical conductivity, n is the number of free electrons per unit volume, e is the charge of an electron, and μ is the mobility of the electrons.

Given:
n = 5.01 * 10^13 cm^(-3) (Convert this to m^(-3): 5.01 * 10^13 cm^(-3) * (100 cm/m)^(-3) = 5.01 * 10^25 m^(-3))
e = 1.6 * 10^(-19) A⋅s (Coulombs)
μ = 0.2 m²⋅V^(-1)⋅s^(-1)

Put the values in the formula:
σ = (5.01 * 10^25 m^(-3)) * (1.6 * 10^(-19) A⋅s) * (0.2 m²⋅V^(-1)⋅s^(-1))
σ = 1.60 * 10^7 Ω^(-1)⋅m^(-1) (rounded to two decimal places)

The electrical conductivity of zone refined Si is 1.60 * 10^7 Ω^(-1)⋅m^(-1), rounded to two decimal places.

Answer: [1.60 * 10^7]
