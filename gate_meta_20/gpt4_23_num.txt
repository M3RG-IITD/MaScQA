To find the corrosion rate, we first need to convert the given values to the appropriate units.

Total exposed surface area (A) = 50 cm²
Weight lost (W) = 200 g = 0.2 kg
Time (t) = 10 years

First, convert cm² to m²:
1 m² = 100 cm x 100 cm = 10000 cm²
So, 50 cm² = 50 / 10000 = 0.005 m²

Now, we can use the formula for corrosion rate (CR):
CR = W / (A * t)

So the corrosion rate is:
CR = 0.2 kg / (0.005 m² * 10 years) = 4 kg.m².year⁻¹

Rounding off to the nearest integer, the corrosion rate is 4 kg.m².year⁻¹.
