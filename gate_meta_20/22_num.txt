Given, fracture toughness $K_(1c)$ = 30 MPa$m^(1/2)$ and assume crack geometry factor of unity. A component subjected to tensile stress in a mechanical device is monitored periodically for cracks by NDT. The NDT technique can only detect cracks( both surface and internal) which are larger than 1mm. Keeping a 10% margin of safety, the maximum allowed tensile stress(MPa) on the component will be? (round off to the neareest integer).
