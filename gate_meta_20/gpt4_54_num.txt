We know that, at equilibrium,
ΔG° = -RT * ln(K)

where
ΔG° is the standard Gibbs free energy change,
R is the gas constant,
T is the temperature, and
K is the equilibrium constant.

Given ΔG° = -19840 - 40.65T J

We can write the equilibrium constant K as:
K = e^(ΔG° / (-RT))

Let the wt.% of dissolved carbon [C] be x. 

Given: [O] = 0.03 wt.%.
At equilibrium, for the reaction:

[C] + [O] → (CO)

K = (CO) / ([C] * [O])

Since we are assuming that 1 wt.% Henrian standard state is equal to 1 atm standard state, the final equilibrium is at 1atm pressure of CO, so (CO) = 1 atm.

We can now substitute the values:

K = 1 / (x * 0.03)

Now, let's calculate the equilibrium constant K using the given values of ΔG° and T:

K = e^[(-19840 - 40.65 * 1800) / (-8.314 * 1800)]

K ≈ 1.7536 × 10^5

Now, we have the equilibrium constant K and the given [O] (0.03 wt.%), so we can calculate the wt.% of dissolved carbon [C]:

1.7536 × 10^5 = 1 /(x * 0.03)

Solving for x:

x = 1 / (1.7536 × 10^5 * 0.03)
x ≈ 0.001893

To convert x to wt.%:

Carbon content [C] = 0.001893 * 100 = 0.1893 wt.%

Rounding off to two decimal places, the dissolved carbon content in the steel is:

[C] ≈ 0.19 wt.%

So the answer is: [0.19]
