The dye penetrant test, also known as liquid penetrant inspection (LPI) or penetrant testing (PT), is a non-destructive testing method used to detect surface-breaking defects or flaws in various materials, including metal, glass, and plastic. In this method, a liquid with high surface wetting characteristics is applied on the surface of the material, and it seeps into any defects present due to capillary action. This test allows for the identification of any open-to-surface discontinuities, such as cracks and pores. 

Now, let's go over the options given:

(A) Magnetism: Magnetism is the basis of the magnetic particle inspection (MPI) method, which is used to detect surface and near-surface discontinuities in ferromagnetic materials like iron and steel. This method involves the use of magnetic particles and a magnetic field to detect flaws. It is not the basis of the dye penetrant test.

(B) Sound propagation: Sound propagation is the basis of the ultrasonic testing (UT) method, which uses high-frequency sound waves to detect and locate defects within the material. This method allows for the identification of both internal and surface-breaking flaws. It is not the basis of the dye penetrant test.

(C) X-ray absorption: X-ray absorption is the basis of radiographic testing (RT), which uses X-rays or gamma rays to detect and locate defects within the material. This method allows for the identification of both internal and surface-breaking flaws. It is not the basis of the dye penetrant test.

(D) Capillary action: Capillary action refers to the movement of a liquid through narrow spaces, such as cracks or pores, due to the cohesive force between the liquid molecules and adhesive force between the liquid and solid materials. Capillary action allows the liquid penetrant to seep into the flaws present on the material's surface during a dye penetrant test, making them visible for inspection.

So, the correct answer is:
