To determine which slip system is not valid, we need to first understand what slip planes and slip directions are possible in a FCC copper crystal.

FCC crystals have four {111} planes and three {100} planes, and since the {111} planes have a greater atomic density, they are more likely to be the slip planes. Each {111} plane has three possible slip directions: [1 1 0], [1 0 1], and [0 1 1].

Using this information, we can evaluate each of the slip systems given in the options:

(A) (1 1 1)[1 -1 0]: The slip plane is {111}, which is valid. The slip direction is [1 -1 0], which is not one of the three possible directions on the {111} plane. Therefore, this slip system is NOT valid.

(B) (-1 1 1)[0 1 1]: The slip plane is {111}, which is valid. The slip direction is [0 1 1], which is one of the three possible directions on the {111} plane. Therefore, this slip system is valid.

(C) (1 -1 1)[1 0 -1]: The slip plane is {111}, which is valid. The slip direction is [1 0 -1], which is not one of the three possible directions on the {111} plane. Therefore, this slip system is NOT valid.

(D) (1 1 -1)[1 0 1]: The slip plane is {1 -1 0}, which is not a valid slip plane in FCC. Therefore, this slip system is NOT valid.

Therefore, the answer is (D) (1 1 -1)[1 0 1].
