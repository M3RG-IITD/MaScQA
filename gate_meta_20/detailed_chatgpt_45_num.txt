To find the Ni content in the weld pool, we need to first calculate the composition of the weld metal.

Let's assume the weight of the weld metal to be 100 g.

From the given information, we know that 20% of the weld pool is contributed from each plate. This means that 40% (20% + 20%) is the dilution of the weld pool.

Therefore, the weight of the diluted metal (i.e. the combined weight of the base metal and filler metal) is:

100 g / (1 - 40%) = 166.67 g

Now, let's calculate the weight of each component in the diluted metal:

For the Fe-10%Ni plate, the weight of Ni is:

10 wt.% x 166.67 g x (1 - 40%) = 10 wt.% x 100 g = 10 g

For the Fe-20%Cr-5%Ni plate, the weight of Ni is:

5 wt.% x 166.67 g x (1 - 40%) = 5 wt.% x 100 g = 5 g

For the filler metal, the weight of Ni is:

20 wt.% x 100 g = 20 g

Therefore, the total weight of Ni in the diluted metal is:

10 g + 5 g + 20 g = 35 g

Finally, we can calculate the Ni content in the weld pool:

Ni content = (weight of Ni / total weight of diluted metal) x 100%

Ni content = (35 g / 166.67 g) x 100% = 21%

Therefore, the Ni content in the weld pool is 21%, rounded off to the nearest integer.
