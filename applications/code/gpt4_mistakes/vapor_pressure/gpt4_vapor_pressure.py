Determining the vapor pressure of a compound from its SMILES string cannot be directly coded without the integration of a database or software tool that can read SMILES strings and extrapolate such scientific information. Python alone doesn't have a feature or library that can interpret SMILES strings into their respective chemical substances. Therefore, the exact code cannot be provided. However, a theoretical example would be the integration of the RDKit library:

```python
from rdkit import Chem
from rdkit.Chem import Descriptors

def vapor_pressure(s):
    """
    Returns the vapor pressure in kilopascals at 25 degrees Celsius given SMILES string s.
    Note: This function is a placeholder and does not actually compute real Vapor pressure.
    It merely serves to illustrate how such a function might be constructed using RDKit.
    """
    molecule = Chem.MolFromSmiles(s)
    descriptor = Descriptors.MolWt(molecule)  # Placeholder representing a descriptor that might influence vapor pressure.
    
    # The following formula is hypothetical and not based on any physical laws.
    p = 0.001 * descriptor  # Hypothetical conversion to kilopascals.
    
    return p
``` 

For real use cases, one would require a validated model or database that provides these parameters for known compounds or a formula that can estimate vapor pressure based on various molecular descriptors which can be computed from the molecule's structure. These molecular descriptors could be number of atoms, type of atoms, molecular weight or more detailed structural features. These descriptors could then be used as parameters in a machine learning model or empirical formula.

Some external softwares that can predict vapor pressures given a SMILES string, like COSMOtherm, SPARC performs automated reasoning in chemistry have APIs that can be used in the python script to fetch data.
