Let's assume the volume fraction of SiC particles in the composite is denoted by 'φ'.

Now, using the rule of mixtures, we can write:

E/ρ = φ*E(SiC)/ρ(SiC) + (1-φ)*E(Al)/ρ(Al)

Given that the specific modulus of the composite is three times that of pure Al, we can write:

E/ρ = 3*(E(Al)/ρ(Al))

Substituting the values and simplifying, we get:

φ = 0.16

Therefore, the volume fraction of SiC particles in the composite is 0.16 or 16%. 

Answer: [0.16, 16%]
