The number of backscattered electrons depends on the atomic number of the elements present. Pb has a higher atomic number than Sn, therefore the α-phase will have a greater number of backscattered electrons compared to the β-phase.

Since the sample is at eutectic composition, the α- and β-phases will have equal area fractions. The backscattered electrons escaping from each phase will depend on the atomic number of the elements present in that phase.

Assuming that the incident electrons have enough energy to penetrate to the bottom of the sample, the backscattered electron intensity is given by the following equation:

I ∝ Z^1.67 

Where I is the intensity and Z is the atomic number of the elements present.

Therefore, we can calculate the ratio of backscattered electrons escaping from α-phase to that from β-phase as follows:

[(Pb)^1.67]/[(Sn)^1.67] = [(97)^1.67]/[(1)^1.67]/[(99)^1.67]/[(50)^1.67]

= 17.48/9.43

= 1.85

Therefore, the ratio of number of backscattered electrons escaping from α-phase to that from β-phase would be greater than 1. 

Answer: (C) Greater than 1
