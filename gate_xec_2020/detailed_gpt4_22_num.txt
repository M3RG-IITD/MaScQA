First, let's list the information provided:

- Diffusivity of carbon in iron (D) at 1100 °C = 6.0 * 10^(-11) m^2/s
- Initial carbon concentration (C0) = 0.1 wt%
- Surface carbon concentration (Cs) = 1.0 wt%
- Desired carbon concentration at 5mm depth (Cx) = 0.46 wt%
- Depth (x) = 5mm = 0.005m

We will use Fick's second law to find the time required for carburization.

Fick's second law, also known as the diffusion equation, is given by:

∂Cx/∂t = D * (∂²Cx/∂x²)

To find the time required for carburization, we need to use the complementary error function (erfc) solution to Fick's second law which is given by the following formula:

(Cx - C0) / (Cs - C0) = erfc(x / (2 * sqrt(D * t)))

Now, we plug in the given values and solve for t:

(0.46 - 0.1) / (1.0 - 0.1) = erfc(0.005 / (2 * sqrt(6.0 * 10^(-11) * t)))

0.36 / 0.9 = erfc(0.005 / (2 * sqrt(6.0 * 10^(-11) * t)))

0.4 = erfc(z), where z = 0.005 / (2 * sqrt(6.0 * 10^(-11) * t))

From the image, we find that when erfc(z) = 0.4, z ≈ 0.5. So, we have:

0.5 = 0.005 / (2 * sqrt(6.0 * 10^(-11) * t))

Now, let's solve for t:

0.5 = 0.005 / (2 * sqrt(6.0 * 10^(-11) * t))

0.005 = 2 * sqrt(6.0 * 10^(-11) * t) * 0.5

0.005 = sqrt(6.0 * 10^(-11) * t)

(0.005)^2 = 6.0 * 10^(-11) * t

25 * 10^(-6) = 6.0 * 10^(-11) * t

t = (25 * 10^(-6)) / (6.0 * 10^(-11))

t ≈ 4.17 * 10^4 s

Now, convert seconds to hours:

t ≈ 4.17 * 10^4 s * (1 hr / 3600 s) ≈ 11.6 hrs

Rounding off to the nearest integer, the carburization time necessary to achieve a carbon concentration of 0.46 wt% at a depth of 5mm at 1100 °C is 12 hours.
