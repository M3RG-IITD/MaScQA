Unfortunately, I cannot see the specific graphs labeled as I, II, III, and IV. Therefore, I cannot directly point out which one represents the variation of molar volume ($V_m$) of a liquid showing glass transition temperature ($T_g$) while cooling from its melting temperature ($T_m$).

However, I can explain the relationship and general behavior of molar volume and glass transition temperature, so you can determine the correct answer based on the graphs you have.

When a liquid is cooled from its melting temperature ($T_m$) to the glass transition temperature ($T_g$), the molecules of the liquid are slowing down due to the decrease in thermal energy. Consequently, the molar volume of the liquid ($V_m$) also tends to decrease during this cooling process, as the molecules are packing closer together.

When the liquid reaches the glass transition temperature ($T_g$), the liquid becomes a glass, a disordered and amorphous solid state. At this point, the liquid has lost enough thermal energy to prevent the molecules from sliding past one another, and they effectively become locked into a rigid structure. In this glassy state, the molar volume remains relatively constant with further decreases in temperature.

Therefore, to determine which graph represents this behavior, look for a graph showing a decreasing $V_m$ as temperature decreases from $T_m$ to $T_g$, and a relatively constant $V_m$ as the temperature continues to decrease past $T_g$. Depending on the specific shapes and trends shown in the graphs I, II, III, and IV, you should be able to identify the correct answer.
