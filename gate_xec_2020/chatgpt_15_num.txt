The surface energy per unit area for the {100} surface of FCC metal can be calculated as follows:

Surface energy of the {100} surface = (number of broken bonds / total number of bonds in the surface plane) * energy per bond

Since this is an FCC metal, there are 4 atoms per unit cell and each atom has 12 nearest neighbors. Therefore, the total number of bonds in the {100} surface plane is:

Total number of bonds in {100} plane = number of atoms in the plane * bonds per atom/2
= 4 * (12/2) 
= 24

For the {111} surface, we need to consider the area of the triangular surface formed by the {111} plane. This area can be calculated using the formula: 

Area of triangle = (1/2) * base * height

Here, the base length is equal to the interatomic distance along the {110} direction, since the {111} plane intersects the {110} planes. The height is equal to half the interatomic distance along the [111] direction, since the {111} plane passes through a single layer of atoms along the [111] direction. Therefore, we can write:

Area of {111} surface = (1/2) * (sqrt(2)*a) * (a/2)
= (sqrt(2)/4) * a^2

where a is the lattice constant.

The surface energy per unit area for the {111} surface can be calculated as follows:

Surface energy of the {111} surface = (number of broken bonds / total number of bonds in the surface plane) * energy per bond * area of surface

Since there are 3 atoms per unit cell in the {111} plane, each with 12 nearest neighbors, the total number of bonds in the {111} surface plane is:

Total number of bonds in {111} plane = number of atoms in the plane * bonds per atom/2
= 3 * (12/2)
= 18

We can assume that only the nearest neighbor broken bonds contribute to the surface energy. For the {100} plane, each atom has 4 nearest neighbors in the plane, so the number of broken bonds per atom is:

Broken bonds per atom in {100} plane = number of nearest neighbors not in the plane/2
= (12-4)/2
= 4

Therefore, the total number of broken bonds in the {100} plane is:

Total broken bonds in {100} plane = number of atoms in the plane * broken bonds per atom
= 4 * 4
= 16

For the {111} plane, each atom has 6 nearest neighbors not in the plane, so the number of broken bonds per atom is:

Broken bonds per atom in {111} plane = number of nearest neighbors not in the plane/2
= 6/2
= 3

Therefore, the total number of broken bonds in the {111} plane is:

Total broken bonds in {111} plane = number of atoms in the plane * broken bonds per atom
= 3 * 3
= 9

The energy per bond can be assumed to be the same for both surfaces. Therefore, the ratio of surface energy of {111} surface to {100} surface is given by:

(9/[(sqrt(2)/4)*a^2]) / (16/(24*a^2)) 
= (27/(sqrt(2)*16))
= 0.95 (rounded off to two decimal places)

Therefore, the answer is: [0.95]
