A ceramic material is periodically heated and cooled between 25° C and a higher temperature $T_f$. During thermal cycling, the material remains dimensionally constrained. The material can withstand a maximum compressive stress of 200 MPa without failure. Material's coefficient of thermal expansion is 7.5* $10^(-6)°C^(-1)$ and modulus of elasticity (E) is 200GPa. The lowest value of $T_f$( in °C) at which material will fail is?(round off to the nearest integer.). Assume that there is no plastic deformation during thermal cycling.
