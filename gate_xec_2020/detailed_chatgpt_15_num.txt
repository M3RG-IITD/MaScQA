For FCC crystal system, the Miller indices for {111} and {100} planes are as follows:

{111} plane: intercepts of a plane with the Cartesian axes are in the ratio 1:1:1, therefore, the Miller indices are [111].

{100} plane: plane passes through the origin and intercepts of a plane with the Cartesian axes are in the ratio 1:0:0, therefore, the Miller indices are [100].

Let us assume that the surface consists of a number of closely packed atoms. For surface creation, the bonds to the nearest neighbor atoms are broken for which we need to supply energy. Hence the surface energy is responsible for the energy required to break these bonds.

The surface energies for FCC metals for different crystal planes can be calculated by using the following approximated equation:

$$\gamma_{hkl}= \frac{E_{hkl}-E_{bul}}{2A}$$

where,

$E_{hkl}$ = total energy of atoms in the exposed surface.

$E_{bul}$ = total energy per atom for a bulk crystal.

$A$ = surface area of the crystal.

$\gamma_{hkl}$= surface energy.

Here, for FCC metal,

The total number of atoms in a unit cell is given by:

$$Z = (8\text{ corner atoms}\times \frac{1}{8}) + (6 \text{ face atoms}\times \frac{1}{2})= 4$$

The expression for energy of the FCC unit cell (per atom) is given by:

$$E_{total}= -\frac{Z\epsilon}{4}$$

where

$\epsilon$ = energy of each bond(in eV).

$Z$ = number of nearest neighbor atoms in a crystal structure.

For {111} surface:

The number of atoms in the surface layer of {111} is calculated as follows:

$${(1/d_{1})}^{2}+2{(\sqrt{2}/d_{1})}^{2}=1$$

where,

$d_{1}$ is the distance between {111} planes and is equal to $\sqrt{2}a$.

Here, $a$ is the lattice parameter.

Solving this equation gives:

$$d_{1}=\sqrt{\frac{2{a^{2}}}{3}}$$

Therefore, the number of atoms in one layer $= 6$.

The surface area of the unit cell = 6 atoms $\times$ area of an equilateral triangle formed by three atoms.

$$A_{111}= 6\sqrt{3}a^{2}/4$$

The total energy of the atoms in the first layer for an unbounded crystal (per atom) is $E_{total}/Z = -\epsilon/4$.

Total energy of the atoms in the first layer for a bounded crystal is given by $E_{layer} = -\frac{3\epsilon}{4}$.  This difference between the two cases is because there are three missing bonds due to the absence of next layer atoms.

$$E_{111}= 6\times E_{layer}=\frac{-9\epsilon}{2}$$

where,

$E_{layer}$ = energy required for the formation of the first layer for a bounded crystal.

Now, surface energy for {111} plane is:

$$\gamma_{111}= \frac{E_{111}-E_{total}}{2A_{111}}=\frac{9\epsilon}{16\sqrt{3}a^{2}}$$

For {100} surface:

The number of atoms in the surface layer of {100} is calculated as follows:

$d_{2}=a$

Therefore, the number of atoms in one layer $= 4$.

The surface area of the unit cell = 4 atoms $\times$ area of a square formed by four atoms.

$$A_{100}= 4a^{2}$$

The total energy of the atoms in the first layer for an unbounded crystal (per atom) is $E_{total}/Z = -\epsilon/4$.

Total energy for the atoms in the first layer for a bounded crystal is given by $E_{layer} = -\frac{\epsilon}{2}$. This difference between the two cases is because there are two missing bonds in the direction perpendicular to the surface.

$$E_{100}=4\times E_{layer}=-2\epsilon$$

where,

$E_{layer}$ = energy required for the formation of the first layer for a bounded crystal.

Now, surface energy for {100} plane is:

$$\gamma_{100}= \frac{E_{100}-E_{total}}{2A_{100}}=\frac{\epsilon}{4a^{2}}$$

The ratio of surface energy of {111} surface to {100} surface is given by:

$$\frac{\gamma_{111}}{\gamma_{100}}=\frac{(\frac{9\epsilon}{16\sqrt{3}a^{2}})}{(\frac{\epsilon}{4a^{2}})}= \frac{9}{4\sqrt{3}}\approx1.64$$

Hence, the ratio of surface energy of {111} surface to {100} surface for FCC crystal is 1.64 (approx).
