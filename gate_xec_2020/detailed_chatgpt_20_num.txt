Given: Specific modulus of Al-SiC composite = 3 x Specific modulus of Al

Let's assume a volume fraction of SiC particles as 'Vf' in the composite.

Now, using the rule of mixture for specific modulus, we have:

Specific modulus of Al-SiC composite = [(1 - Vf) x Specific modulus of Al] + [Vf x Specific modulus of SiC]

Since we know that Specific modulus of Al-SiC composite = 3 x Specific modulus of Al, we can substitute that in the above equation and simplify:

3 x Specific modulus of Al = [(1 - Vf) x Specific modulus of Al] + [Vf x Specific modulus of SiC]

3 = (1 - Vf) + Vf x [Specific modulus of SiC/Specific modulus of Al]

3 - 1 = Vf x [Specific modulus of SiC/Specific modulus of Al]

2 = Vf x [Specific modulus of SiC/Specific modulus of Al]

Vf = 2 x [Specific modulus of Al/Specific modulus of SiC]

Now, we need to find the values of Specific modulus of Al and SiC.

From the reference material, Specific modulus of aluminum and silicon carbide are 70 GPa and 450 GPa respectively.

Substituting these values in the above equation, we get:

Vf = 2 x [70 / 450]

Vf = 0.31 (rounded off to two decimal places)

Therefore, the volume fraction of SiC particles required in the composite to have a specific modulus three times that of pure Al under iso-strain condition is approximately 0.31.
