The formula for calculating the transmittance(T) of light through a material of thickness x and absorption coefficient α is:

T = exp(-αx)

Here, α = $10^3$ $m^{-1}$ and x is the thickness of the shaded material.

Also, the reflectance(R) of the material is given as 0.05. This means that 95% of the incident light is either transmitted or absorbed by the material.

Using the formula for transmittance, we get:

T = exp(-αx) = exp(-10^3*x)

We do not know the exact value of x, but we know that the total thickness of the shaded material is equal to the distance between the two parallel lines in the diagram. Let's assume this distance to be d.

Now, we know that the incident light is either reflected or transmitted by the material. Hence, the intensity of the incident light(I°) must be equal to the sum of the intensities of the reflected and transmitted light.

I° = I + R*I°    (where R*I° is the intensity of the reflected light)

Solving for I, we get:

I = I°/(1+R) = I°/(1+0.05) = 0.9524*I°

Hence, the transmittance(T) is given as:

T = exp(-αx) = exp(-10^3* (d/2) )    (Since the light passes through the material twice, we take half the thickness)

Finally, substituting the values, we get:

T = exp(-10^3* (0.02/2) ) = 0.818

Therefore, the transmittance of light through the material is 0.818.
