To determine the ratio of the number of backscattered electrons escaping from α-phase to that from β-phase, we need to find the atomic number (Z) contrast, which is a key factor affecting the intensity of backscattered electrons in scanning electron microscopes.

The number of backscattered electrons is proportional to the average atomic number (Z) of the material being scanned. This means that materials with higher atomic numbers will produce more backscattered electrons than materials with lower atomic numbers.

In the given problem, we have the following information:

α-phase: contains ~97 wt% Pb (atomic number 82)
β-phase: contains ~99 wt% Sn (atomic number 50)

Now, we need to find the average atomic number (Z) for each phase.

For α-phase, the average atomic number (Zα) can be calculated as follows:

Zα = (0.97 * Z_Pb) + (0.03 * Z_Sn)
where Z_Pb is the atomic number of Pb and Z_Sn is the atomic number of Sn.

Zα = (0.97 * 82) + (0.03 * 50)

Zα ≈ 79.64

Similarly, for the β-phase, the average atomic number (Zβ) can be calculated as follows:

Zβ = (0.99 * Z_Sn) + (0.01 * Z_Pb)

Zβ = (0.99 * 50) + (0.01 * 82)

Zβ ≈ 50.32

Now, we need to calculate the ratio of backscattered electrons escaping from α-phase to that from β-phase:

Ratio = (number of backscattered electrons from α-phase) / (number of backscattered electrons from β-phase)

As the number of backscattered electrons is proportional to the average atomic number (Z), we can write:

Ratio = Zα / Zβ

Ratio = 79.64 / 50.32

Ratio ≈ 1.582

Since the ratio is greater than 1, the correct answer is (C) Greater than 1.

Final answer: [(C) Greater than 1].
