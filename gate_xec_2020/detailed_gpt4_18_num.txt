To find the saturation magnetic moment of Fe₃O₄ per formula unit in terms of Bohr magnetons (µ_B), we first need to understand the magnetic moments of the cations in the structure.

Fe₃O₄ can be represented as FeO.Fe₂O₃, with Fe²⁺ ions in FeO and Fe³⁺ ions in Fe₂O₃. The Fe²⁺ ions are in the tetrahedral sites, while half of the octahedral sites are occupied by Fe³⁺ ions and the other half by Fe²⁺ ions. 

To find the magnetic moment of an ion, we can use the formula:

magnetic moment (µ) = √(n(n+2)) µ_B

where n is the number of unpaired electrons, and µ_B is the Bohr magneton.

1. Determine the electronic configuration of Fe²⁺ and Fe³⁺ ions:

Fe (atomic number 26) has the electronic configuration: [Ar] 3d^6 4s^2
Fe²⁺ (removing 2 electrons): [Ar] 3d^6
Fe³⁺ (removing 3 electrons): [Ar] 3d^5

2. Find the number of unpaired electrons:

Fe²⁺ (3d^6) has 4 unpaired electrons.
Fe³⁺ (3d^5) has 5 unpaired electrons.

3. Calculate the magnetic moments of Fe²⁺ and Fe³⁺ ions:

Fe²⁺: µ(Fe²⁺) = √(4(4+2)) µ_B = √(4*6) µ_B = 4.89898 µ_B
Fe³⁺: µ(Fe³⁺) = √(5(5+2)) µ_B = √(5*7) µ_B = 5.56776 µ_B

4. Determine the net magnetic moment per formula unit:

Considering that the magnetic moments of octahedral and tetrahedral sites are antiparallel:

Net magnetic moment = (1 tetrahedral Fe²⁺ * magnetic moment of Fe²⁺) - (1 octahedral Fe²⁺ * magnetic moment of Fe²⁺) - (2 octahedral Fe³⁺ * magnetic moment of Fe³⁺)

Net magnetic moment = (1 * 4.89898 µ_B) - (1 * 4.89898 µ_B) - (2 * 5.56776 µ_B) = -11.13552 µ_B

Since the magnetic moment is antiparallel to each other, it implies the direction of magnetic moment is opposite. So, we can take the absolute value of the net magnetic moment:

Net magnetic moment = |-11.13552 µ_B| = 11.13552 µ_B

So, the saturation magnetic moment of Fe₃O₄ per formula unit in terms of Bohr magnetons (µ_B) is 11.13552 µ_B.

The correct answer is [11.13552].
