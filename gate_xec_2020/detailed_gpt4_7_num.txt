Given, the fracture toughness ($K_{IC}$) of the ceramic is 1 MPa.m^(1/2). The maximum stress (σ) is 200 MPa and the geometrical factor (f) is 1.2. We need to find the maximum value of half crack length 'a' (in micrometers) below which the material does not fail.

The critical stress intensity factor ($K_{IC}$) for the ceramic can be given by the equation:

$K_{IC}$ = σ * √(π * a) * f

where
$K_{IC}$ = fracture toughness (1 MPa.m^(1/2))
σ = maximum stress (200 MPa)
a = half crack length
f = geometrical factor (1.2)

We need to solve for 'a' using the given values:

1 MPa.m^(1/2) = 200 MPa * √(π * a) * 1.2

To remove the units and make the equation dimensionless, we consider the conversion factor:
1 MPa = 10^6 Pa
1 m = 10^6 µm

1 * 10^6 Pa * 10^(-6) µm^(1/2) = 200 * 10^6 Pa * √(π * a) * 1.2

1 * 10^(-6) m^(1/2) = 240 * 10^6 Pa * √(π * a)

Now, we can solve for 'a':

1 / (240 * 10^6 * √π) = √a
(1 / 240)^2 / 10^(-12) / π = a

a = 1.7353 * 10^-8 m

Converting meters to micrometers:

a = 1.7353 * 10^-8 m * (10^6 µm/m)
a ≈ 17.4 µm

Therefore, the maximum value of half crack length 'a' below which the material does not fail is approximately 17.4 µm.

The correct answer is [17.4].
