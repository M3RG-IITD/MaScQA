Given: Diffusivity of carbon in iron at 1100 °C is 6.0* $10^(-11)m^(2).s^(-1) and erf(z) from the image. A plain carbon steel sample containing 0.1 wt% carbon is undergoing carburization at 1100 ° C in a carbon rich surroundings with fixed carbon content of 1.0 wt% all the time. The carburization time(in hours) necessary to achieve a crabon concentration of 0.46 wt% at a depth of 5mm at 1100 °C is?(round-off to the nearest integer).
