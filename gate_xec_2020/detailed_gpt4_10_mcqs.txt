Let's analyze both statements step by step.

Statement-1: Sintering in vacuum leads to improved densification as compared to sintering under ambient (at atmospheric pressure) condition.

Analysis: Sintering is a process where the surfaces of the particles fuse together to form a solid mass. Vacuum sintering is a process in which sintering takes place in a vacuum environment. In a vacuum, there is no gas present that can react with the material, leading to less impurities in the final product. Furthermore, the absence of atmospheric pressure allows for better particle rearrangement and improved densification. So, Statement-1 is TRUE.

Statement-2: Closed pores formed during sintering inhibit full densification.

Analysis: During the sintering process, particles are rearranged and fused together, which causes closed pores to form within the material. Since the closed pores occupy volume within the material, they can prevent achieving full densification, as the available space is limited by the presence of these pores. So, Statement-2 is TRUE.

Now let's match our analysis with the given options:

(A) Both Statement-1 and Statement-2 are FALSE.
Since our analysis has shown that both statements are true, this option is incorrect.

(B) Both statement-1 and Statement-2 are TRUE.
This option matches our analysis, and both statements are indeed true.

(C) Statement-1 is TRUE but Statement -2 is FALSE.
This option contradicts our analysis that both statements are true, so it is incorrect.

(D) Statement-1 is FALSE but Statement-2 is TRUE.
This option also contradicts our analysis that both statements are true, so it is incorrect.

Based on our analysis, the correct answer is:

[B]
