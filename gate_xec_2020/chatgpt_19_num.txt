We know that,

$v_z$ = $d_(zz)$ * $F_z$

$\implies v_z$ = 100 * $10^(-12) C.N^(-1)$ * 10N

$\implies v_z$ = 1 * $10^(-9) C.N^(-1)$ * 10N

$\implies v_z$ = 10 * $10^(-9) C$

We know that,

$C = ε_r ε_° A/d$

where A is the area of the plate and d is the distance between the plates.

Here, we have only one plate,

$\implies C = ε_r ε_° A/d_z$

We know that,

$Q = C V$

where Q is the charge and V is the voltage.

$\implies v_z = Q/C$

$\implies V = v_z$

$\implies V = 10 * 10^(-9) C / (1100 * 8.85 * 10^(-12) F.m^(-1) * 1m)$

$\implies V = 0.10 V$

Therefore, the voltage developed along the z-direction of the sample will be 0.10 volts. 

Answer: [0.10]
