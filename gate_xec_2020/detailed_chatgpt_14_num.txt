Let's approach this problem by using the concept of Bernoulli trials, where each month is a trial with a success probability of 1/100 (i.e. the probability of an accident occurring).

We are interested in finding the smallest value of 'n' such that P(n) ≤ ½, which means the probability of no accident over a period of 'n' months is less than or equal to ½. We can express P(n) as follows:

P(n) = (1 - 1/100)^n

This is based on the fact that we are looking for the probability of no accidents occurring over 'n' months, which is the probability of having a non-accident month (i.e. success) in each of the 'n' Bernoulli trials. The probability of having a non-accident month is (1 - 1/100) since it is the complement of the probability of having an accident (i.e. failure).

Now, we need to solve the inequality:

(1 - 1/100)^n ≤ ½

Taking natural logarithm on both sides, we get:

n * ln(1 - 1/100) ≤ ln(½)

Dividing by ln(1 - 1/100) (which is negative), we get:

n ≥ ln(½) / ln(1 - 1/100)

Using a calculator, we get:

n ≥ 69.31

Rounding off to the nearest integer, we get:

n = 70

Therefore, the smallest integer value of 'n' such that P(n) ≤ ½ is 70.
