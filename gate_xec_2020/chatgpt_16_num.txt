Number of phosphorus atoms per cubic meter = 1 ppm of 5 * $10^(28)$ atoms/m3 = (1/10^6) * 5 * $10^(28)$ atoms/m3 = 5 * $10^(22)$ atoms/m3

As the silicon is doped with phosphorus, the number of free electrons per cubic meter will increase by the number of phosphorus atoms per cubic meter.

$n_{ph}$ = number of free electrons per cubic meter due to phosphorus  = 5 * $10^(22)$ electrons/m3

$n_i$ = intrinsic carrier concentration of Si at T = 300K = 9.65 * $10^(9)$ electrons/m3

As the silicon is doped with phosphorus, the number of free electrons per cubic meter will increase by the number of phosphorus atoms per cubic meter.

$n$ = total carrier concentration after doping = $n_i$ + $n_{ph}$ = 5.000000965 * $10^(28)$ electrons/m3

$n/n_i$ = $exp(E_f-E_i/k_B T)$

Here, $E_i$ = intrinsic Fermi level of pure Si and $E_f$ = Fermi energy level after doping.

$E_f-E_i$ = $ln(n/n_i) * k_B T$

= $ln(5.1688 * 10^18) * 1.38 * 10^(-23) * 300$

= 0.126 eV

Therefore, the shift in Fermi energy upon doping with respect to intrinsic Fermi level of pure Si will be 0.13 eV (rounded off to two decimal places). 

Answer: [0.13]
