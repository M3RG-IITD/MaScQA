To find the volume fraction of SiC particles in the composite, we'll use the rule of mixtures for specific modulus (E/ρ) under the iso-strain condition. The equation for iso-strain condition is:

(E/ρ)_composite = Vf * (E/ρ)_SiC + (1 - Vf) * (E/ρ)_Al

Where Vf is the volume fraction of SiC particles, (E/ρ)_SiC is the specific modulus of SiC, (E/ρ)_Al is the specific modulus of pure Al, and (E/ρ)_composite is the specific modulus of the resulting composite.

Given that the specific modulus of the composite is three times that of pure Al, we have:

(E/ρ)_composite = 3 * (E/ρ)_Al

Substituting this expression into the iso-strain equation, we get:

3 * (E/ρ)_Al = Vf * (E/ρ)_SiC + (1 - Vf) * (E/ρ)_Al

Now, we'll rearrange the equation to solve for Vf:

Vf * [(E/ρ)_SiC - (E/ρ)_Al] = 2 * (E/ρ)_Al

Dividing both sides by (E/ρ)_SiC - (E/ρ)_Al, we find the volume fraction of SiC particles:

Vf = [2 * (E/ρ)_Al] / [(E/ρ)_SiC - (E/ρ)_Al]

Since we only have the ratios, we cannot compute an exact value for Vf without knowing the actual values of specific modulus for SiC and Al. However, with actual values, the volume fraction can be calculated using the formula above and rounded to two decimal places.
