Given: 
- Isothermal weight gain per unit area (ΔW/A) during oxidation at 600°C follows parabolic rate law. 
- ΔW/A = 1.0 mg.A$cm^(-2)$ after 100 min of oxidation. 
- We need to find ΔW/A (in mg.$cm^(-2)$) after 500 min at 600°C. 

To solve this problem, we can use the parabolic rate law equation for isothermal oxidation: 

ΔW/A = k*t^(1/2)

where:
- ΔW/A: Isothermal weight gain per unit area (in mg.$cm^(-2)$)
- k: rate constant
- t: time (in min)

We can find the value of the rate constant(k) using the given information: 

ΔW/A = k*t^(1/2)

1.0 = k*(100)^(1/2)

k = 1.0/(100)^(1/2) = 0.1 mg.$cm^(-2)$.min^(-1/2)

Now, we can use this rate constant to find the value of ΔW/A after 500 min of oxidation: 

ΔW/A = k*t^(1/2)

ΔW/A = (0.1 mg.$cm^(-2)$.min^(-1/2))*(500)^(1/2)

ΔW/A = 1.58 mg.$cm^(-2)$

Therefore, the ΔW/A (in mg.$cm^(-2)$) after 500 min at 600°C will be 1.58 (rounded off to two decimal places). 

Answer: [1.58]
