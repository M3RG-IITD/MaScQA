Intrinsic carrier concentration of Si, $n_i$ is gives as: $n_i$ = 2* $([2πmk_(B)T]/h^(2))^(3/2)$ * $exp(-{E_g/k_(B)T})$ wher Mass of an electron, m = 9.1 * $10^(-31)$ kg, charge of an electron, e = 1.6 * $10^(-19)$ C, Boltzmann constant $k_B$ = 1.38 * $10^(-23)$ J.$K^(-1)$, Planck’s constant h = 6.6 * $10^(-34)$ J.$s^(-1)$. Pure silicon (Si) has a band gap ($E_g$) of 1.1 eV. This Si is doped with 1 ppm (parts per million) of phosphorus atoms. Si contains 5 * $10^(28)$ per atoms per $m^3$ in pure form. At temperature T = 300K, the shift in Fermi energy(in ev) upon doping with respect to intrinsic Fermi level of pure Si will be? (with appropriate sign and round-off to two decimal places).
