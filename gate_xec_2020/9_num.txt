Given that 	$γ_(sl)$ (solid liquid interfacial energy) is 0.18 $J.m^(-2)$ and $ΔG_v$ (change in volume free energy upon transformation from liquid to solid) is $T_s$ is 0.18*$10^(9)J.m^(-3)$. During homogeneous solidification of a liquid metal, the radius of critical nucleus(in nanometer, nm) at a temperature $T_s$ which is below the melting point($T_m$), is ? (round-off to one decimal place).
