To find the smallest of minimum feature size that can be theoretically resolved in an optical microscope, we use the Abbe's resolution formula, which is given by:

d = λ / (2 * NA)

where:
- d is the minimum resolvable feature size (also called the resolution limit)
- λ is the wavelength of the radiation
- NA is the numerical aperture of the objective lens, which is defined as NA = n * sinθ, where n is the refractive index of the medium between the lens and the focal point, and θ is the half-angle of the maximum cone of light that can enter or exit the lens.

Now let's analyze each option to see which one does NOT affect the smallest of minimum feature size:

(A) Refractive index of the medium between the lens and the focal point: From the numerical aperture's formula, we can see that the refractive index (n) plays a crucial role in determining the numerical aperture, and hence, the resolution limit (d). So, this parameter does indeed affect the minimum feature size.

(B) Intensity of radiation: The intensity of radiation determines the amount of light being used in the imaging process, but it does not have any direct impact on the resolution limit, i.e., the minimum resolvable feature size. The resolution is instead determined by the wavelength and the numerical aperture, as explained by Abbe's resolution formula. Therefore, the intensity of radiation does NOT affect the smallest of minimum feature size.

(C) Wavelength of radiation: From Abbe's resolution formula, it's clear that the wavelength of the radiation (λ) is an essential parameter for determining the resolution limit (d). A shorter wavelength will result in better resolution, while a longer wavelength will decrease the resolution. Thus, the resolution limit is dependent on the wavelength of radiation.

(D) Numerical aperture of the objective lens: As mentioned earlier, the numerical aperture (NA) is a defining parameter in Abbe's resolution formula. A higher numerical aperture corresponds to a smaller resolution limit, which means that better resolution can be achieved. Thus, the resolution limit is also dependent on the numerical aperture of the objective lens.

Based on the analysis above, the correct answer is:

[B] Intensity of radiation
