First, we need to use the given data to calculate the maximum compressive strain that the material can withstand without failure. We can use the formula:

$\sigma = E\epsilon$

where $\sigma$ is the compressive stress, E is the modulus of elasticity, and $\epsilon$ is the compressive strain. Rearranging this formula gives:

$\epsilon = \frac{\sigma}{E}$

Plugging in the given values, we get:

$\epsilon = \frac{200\text{ MPa}}{200\text{ GPa}} = 0.001$

Next, we need to find the amount of thermal expansion that will occur during each heating and cooling cycle. We can use the formula:

$\Delta L = \alpha L \Delta T$

where $\Delta L$ is the change in length, $\alpha$ is the coefficient of thermal expansion, $L$ is the original length, and $\Delta T$ is the change in temperature. Rearranging this formula gives:

$\Delta T = \frac{\Delta L}{\alpha L}$

Since the material is dimensionally constrained, the compressive strain and the expansion/contraction from thermal cycling will be equal in magnitude. Thus, we can set the maximum compressive strain equal to the maximum strain from thermal cycling:

$\epsilon = \frac{\Delta L}{L} = \frac{\alpha \Delta T}{1} = \alpha \Delta T$

Substituting in the given values and solving for $\Delta T$, we get:

$\Delta T = \frac{\epsilon}{\alpha} = \frac{0.001}{7.5\times 10^{-6}} = 133.33\text{ °C}$

This means that the temperature of the material will be changing by 133.33 °C during each thermal cycle. To find the lowest value of $T_f$ that will cause failure, we need to find the number of cycles that can be completed before the total change in temperature (from 25 °C) exceeds the maximum allowable strain. Let's assume that the material fails when the compressive strain exceeds the maximum allowable strain by a small amount $\delta$, such that:

$\epsilon_{total} = \epsilon + \delta$

where $\epsilon$ is the maximum allowable compressive strain we calculated earlier.

After $n$ cycles, the total change in temperature will be $n\Delta T$, so the total compressive strain will be:

$\epsilon_{total} = n\epsilon = n\alpha\Delta T$

Setting this equal to $\epsilon + \delta$, we get:

$n\alpha\Delta T = \epsilon + \delta$

Solving for $n$, we get:

$n = \frac{\epsilon + \delta}{\alpha\Delta T}$

Plugging in the given values, we get:

$n = \frac{0.001 + \delta}{7.5\times 10^{-6}\times 133.33} = \frac{0.001 + \delta}{0.001}

Since we want the lowest value of $T_f$ at which the material will fail, we want to find the smallest value of $n$ that is an integer. This occurs when $0.001 + \delta$ is equal to 1/2 of 0.001, or 0.0005. Thus, we get:

$0.0005 = \epsilon + \delta$

$\delta = 0.0005 - 0.001 = -0.0005$

$n = \frac{0.001 - 0.0005}{7.5\times 10^{-6}\times 133.33} = 66.67$

Therefore, the maximum allowable number of cycles is 66.67. The total change in temperature over these cycles is:

$\Delta T_{total} = n\Delta T = 66.67\times 133.33 = 8888.89\text{ °C}$

Adding this to the initial temperature of 25 °C gives:

$T_f = 25 + 8888.89 = 8913.89 \approx \boxed{8914}\text{ °C}$

Therefore, the lowest value of $T_f$ at which the material will fail is 8914 °C.
