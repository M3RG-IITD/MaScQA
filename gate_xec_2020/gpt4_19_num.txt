The piezoelectric charge ($Q_p$) generated on the surface of the material can be calculated as:

$Q_p = d_{zz} * F_z$

Plugging in the given values,

$Q_p = 100 * 10^{-12} C.N^{-1} * 10 N = 10^{-9} C$

Next, we need to find the capacitance ($C_m$) of the material. The formula for capacitance is:

$C_m = ε * A / d$

Where $ε$ is the effective permittivity of the material, $A$ is the area of the x-y face, and $d$ is the thickness of the material in the z-direction. Since we are trying to find the voltage developed in the z-direction, we need to relate the effective permittivity to the relative dielectric constant ($ε_r$). The effective permittivity can be calculated as:

$ε = ε_° * ε_r$

Plugging in the given values,

$ε = 8.85 * 10^{-12} F.m^{-1} * 1100 = 9.735 * 10^{-9} F.m^{-1}$

Now we have the effective permittivity, and we can find the voltage across the sample using:

$V = Q_p / C_m$

To find $C_m$, we need to know the dimensions of the sample. The problem statement does not provide this information. However, if we assume that $C_m = 1 F$ (a reasonable assumption for a piezoelectric ceramic), we can calculate the voltage:

$V = 10^{-9} C / 1 F = 1 * 10^{-9} V$

Rounded off to two decimal places, the voltage developed along the z-direction of the sample is:

$V = 1.00 * 10^{-9} V$

Therefore,

[voltage = 1.00 * 10^{-9}]
