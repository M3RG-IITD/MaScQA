Given that for the wavelength used, α = $10^(3)m^(-1)$ and R = 0.05. The diagram in the image shows the light of intensity $I_°$ incident on a material(shaded grey) of thickness, x, which has an absorption coefficient, α and reflectance, R. The intensity of transmitted light is I. The reflection of light( of a particular wavelength) occurs at both the surfaces( surfaces indicated in the diagram). The transmittance is estimated to be?(round-off to three decimal places)
