We will use the formula for stress induced in a material due to thermal cycling when it is dimensionally constrained. The formula is:

Stress = E * α * ΔT

Here, ΔT is the change in temperature, α is the coefficient of thermal expansion, and E is the modulus of elasticity.

Given, maximum compressive stress = 200 MPa = 200 * 10^6 Pa
α = 7.5 * 10^(-6) °C^(-1)
E = 200 GPa = 200 * 10^9 Pa
Initial temperature, T_i = 25 °C

We need to find the final temperature, $T_f$, at which the material will fail.

First, let's find ΔT:

Stress = E * α * ΔT
200 * 10^6 = (200 * 10^9) * (7.5 * 10^(-6)) * ΔT
ΔT = 200 * 10^6 / (200 * 10^9 * 7.5 * 10^(-6))
ΔT = 1.3333 °C

Now, we can find the final temperature, $T_f$:

$T_f$ = T_i + ΔT
$T_f$ = 25 + 1.3333
$T_f$ ≈ 26.333

We should round off to the nearest integer, so $T_f$ ≈ 26°C.

So, the answer is [26].
