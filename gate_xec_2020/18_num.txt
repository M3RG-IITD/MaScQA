$Fe_(3)O_(4)$ (also represented as FeO.$Fe_(2)O_(3)$) is a FCC structured inverse spinel ($AB_2O_4) material where 1/8 of tetrahedral sites are occupied by half of B cations and 1/2 of the octahedral sites are occupied by remaining B and A cations. The magneteic moments of cations on octahedral sites are antiparallel with respect to those on tetrahedral sites. Atomic number of Fe is 26 and that of O is 8. The saturation magnetic moment of $Fe_(3)O_(4)$ per formula unit in terms of Bohr magnetons ($Âµ_B$) will be ? Ignore contribution from orbital magnetic moments.
