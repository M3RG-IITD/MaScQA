To calculate the saturation magnetic moment of $Fe_3O_4$, we need to first determine the number of iron ions on both tetrahedral and octahedral sites.

Let the number of Fe ions on tetrahedral sites be x, and those on octahedral sites be y.

According to the given information, we have:

- There are 4 formula units of $Fe_3O_4$ in the FCC unit cell.
- Each formula unit contains 3 iron ions (from $Fe_2O_3$) and 4 iron ions (from FeO) in a 1:2 ratio.
- Therefore, we have 3x + 4y = 8 (total number of iron ions per formula unit)
- Also, 1/8 of the tetrahedral sites are occupied by half of the B cations, i.e. (1/8)x = 1/2(4) = 2. Thus, x = 16.
- And, 1/2 of the octahedral sites are occupied by the remaining B and A cations, i.e. (1/2)y = 1/2(3x+4y-8) = 12. Thus, y = 24.

Now, we can calculate the total magnetic moment of $Fe_3O_4$ per formula unit:

- Each Fe ion has an atomic number of 26 and a spin-only magnetic moment of √(n(n+2)) µB, where n is the number of unpaired electrons. In this case, all the Fe ions are in the 3+ state, so n = 5 and the spin-only magnetic moment is √(5(5+2)) µB = 5.92 µB.
- The magnetic moments of the Fe ions on tetrahedral and octahedral sites are antiparallel, so they cancel each other out.
- Therefore, the total magnetic moment per formula unit is simply the sum of the magnetic moments of the remaining Fe ions (on octahedral sites):
- Total magnetic moment = (y)(5.92 µB) = (24)(5.92 µB) = 142.08 µB ≈ 142 µB (rounded to the nearest whole number)

Thus, the saturation magnetic moment of $Fe_3O_4$ per formula unit in terms of Bohr magnetons is 142 µB.

Answer: [142 µB]
