To solve this problem, first, we need to find the electric displacement, $D_z$, caused by the force $F_z$. Then, we will use the formula relating the electric displacement to the electric field, permittivity of free space, and relative dielectric constant. Finally, we will use the formula relating the electric field to the potential difference (voltage) to find the voltage developed along the z-direction.

Step 1: Find the electric displacement, $D_z$

The piezoelectric coefficient ($d_{zz}$) can be used to find the electric displacement caused by the force applied to the material.

The formula for this relationship is:

$D_z = d_{zz} \times F_z$

Substituting the given values, we have,

$D_z = (100 * 10^{-12} \ C/N) \times (10 \ N)$

$D_z = 10^{-9} \ C/m^2$

Step 2: Calculate the electric field, $E_z$

We can relate the electric displacement, $D_z$, to the electric field, $E_z$, using the formula:

$D_z = \epsilon_0 \epsilon_r E_z$

Then, the electric field can be calculated as:

$E_z = \frac{D_z}{\epsilon_0 \epsilon_r}$

Substituting the given values, we have,

$E_z = \frac{10^{-9} \ C/m^2}{(8.85 * 10^{-12} \ F/m)(1100)}$

$E_z = \frac{10^{-9} \ C/m^2}{(8.85 * 10^{-9} \ F/m)}$

$E_z = 10^3 \ V/m$

Step 3: Calculate the voltage developed along the z-direction, $V_z$

The electric field $E_z$ is uniform along the z-direction. Therefore, the voltage developed along the z-direction can be directly calculated as:

$V_z = E_z * L$

Here we need an additional piece of information, the length $L$ of the sample in the z-direction. However, this is not provided in the question. Assuming that the length of the sample is given or known, we can calculate the voltage by multiplying the electric field by the length of the sample.
