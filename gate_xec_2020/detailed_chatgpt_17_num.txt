From the given data, we have:

Absorption coefficient, Î± = $10^3$ $m^{-1}$

Reflectance, R = 0.05

Intitial intensity of light, $I_0$

Intensity of transmitted light, I

Thickness of material, x

We can use Beer-Lambert law to relate the intensity of the incident light of initial intensity $I_0$ with the intensity of the transmitted light, I as:

$I = I_0e^{-\alpha x}$    ...................(1)

Also, we know that the reflectance, R represents the fraction of light reflected by a surface. Hence, the fraction of light absorbed and transmitted by the material is (1-R). Therefore, the intensity of the transmitted light can be given as:

$I = (1-R)I_0e^{-\alpha x}$ 

or,

$I/I_0 = (1-R)e^{-\alpha x}$               ...................(2)

The transmittance, T is defined as the ratio of intensity of transmitted light, I to the initial intensity of incident light, $I_0$. 

Hence, 

$T = (I/I_0)$

From eqn. (2), we have

$T = (1-R)e^{-\alpha x}$

Substituting the given values, we get:

$T = (1-0.05)e^{-10^3 * x}$

$T = 0.95e^{-10^3 * x}$

Therefore, the transmittance of the material is given by the above expression. We can substitute the value of thickness, x to get the numerical value of transmittance. 

Answer: [0.95e^(-10^3*x)]
