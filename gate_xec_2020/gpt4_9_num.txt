We can find the radius of the critical nucleus during homogeneous solidification using the Gibbs-Thomson Equation:

$$r* = \frac{2γ_(sl)}{ΔG_v}$$

Given that $γ_(sl)$ = 0.18 J/m² and $ΔG_v$ = 0.18 * $10^9$ J/m³, we can substitute these values into the equation:

$$r* = \frac{2(0.18)}{(0.18)(10^9)}$$

Simplifying this expression, we get:

$$r* = \frac{0.36}{0.18(10^9)}$$

$$r* = \frac{0.36}{1.8(10^8)}$$

$$r* = \frac{1}{5(10^8)}$$

To convert this to nanometers, we multiply by $10^9$:

$$r* = 10^9 \times \frac{1}{5(10^8)}$$

$$r* = 2nm$$

The radius of the critical nucleus during homogeneous solidification of a liquid metal is 2 nm.
