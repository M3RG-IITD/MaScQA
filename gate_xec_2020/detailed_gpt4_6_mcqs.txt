Unfortunately, I cannot see the image you are referring to. However, I will provide you with a general approach to solving this type of problem.

Based on the given options, it appears that you are provided with:

Column I: Four different polymer names
Column II: Four corresponding monomer types

To solve this problem, you need to correctly match the polymer names with their specific monomer types.

Here's a general step-by-step approach to solve this type of problem:

Step 1: Familiarize yourself with the polymer names in Column I and their corresponding monomer types in Column II.

Step 2: Research or recall the specific monomer types that make up each polymer.

Step 3: Compare the monomer types for each polymer to the possible matches in Column II.

Step 4: Based on your findings, identify the correct match between the polymer names and monomer types.

Step 5: Choose the appropriate match from the given options (A, B, C, or D).

Again, since I cannot see the image, I cannot provide the correct answer within a list. However, I hope this general approach helps guide you in solving the problem.
