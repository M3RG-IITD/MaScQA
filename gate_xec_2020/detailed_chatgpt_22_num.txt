We can use Fick's Second Law to solve this problem: 

$C(x,t) = C_0 + \frac{C_{s}-C_0}{2} \left[ erf \left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{4Dt}} \right) \right] $

where 
- $C(x,t)$ is the concentration of carbon at a distance x from the surface after a time t 
- $C_0$ is the initial concentration of carbon in the steel 
- $C_s$ is the concentration of carbon at the surface, which is fixed at 1.0 wt% 
- $D$ is the diffusivity of carbon in iron at 1100°C 
- $erf$ is the error function 

We want to find the time necessary to achieve a carbon concentration of 0.46 wt% at a depth of 5mm, which means $C(5 \text{ mm}, t) = 0.46$ wt%. 

Substituting the given values into Fick's Second Law, we get: 

$0.46 = 0.1 + \frac{(1.0-0.1)}{2} \left[ erf \left( \frac{5 \text{ mm}}{\sqrt{4(6.0 \times 10^{-11} m^2/s)(t)}} \right) \right]$ 

Simplifying: 

$erf \left( \frac{5 \text{ mm}}{\sqrt{4(6.0 \times 10^{-11} m^2/s)(t)}} \right) = 1.720$ 

Using the table of values of $erf(z)$ or a calculator, we can find that $erf^{-1}(1.720) = 1.733$. 

Therefore: 

$\frac{5 \text{ mm}}{\sqrt{4(6.0 \times 10^{-11} m^2/s)(t)}} = 1.733$ 

Solving for t: 

$t = \frac{(5 \text{ mm})^2}{4(6.0 \times 10^{-11} m^2/s)(1.733)^2} = 215 \text{ hours}$ 

Rounding to the nearest integer, the answer is: 

- 215 hours 

Therefore, it would take approximately 215 hours of carburization at 1100 °C for the carbon concentration to reach 0.46 wt% at a depth of 5mm.
