The parabolic rate law for oxidation of a metal is given by the following equation:

ΔW/A = K * t^0.5

Here, K is the parabolic rate constant, t is the time (in min), and ΔW/A is the isothermal weight gain per unit area (in mg.cm^-2). 

We know that ΔW/A = 1.0 mg.cm^-2 after 100 min, so we can plug these values into the equation to find K:

1.0 = K * (100)^0.5
1.0 = K * 10
K = 0.1

Now, we want to find ΔW/A after 500 min at 600°C. We can plug the known value of K back into the equation:

ΔW/A = K * t^0.5
ΔW/A = 0.1 * (500)^0.5
ΔW/A = 0.1 * (sqrt(500))
ΔW/A = 0.1 * 22.36
ΔW/A = 2.236

We need to round off to two decimal places:

ΔW/A = 2.24 mg.cm^-2

Therefore, the isothermal weight gain per unit area after 500 min at 600°C will be 2.24 mg.cm^-2. Answer: [2.24].
