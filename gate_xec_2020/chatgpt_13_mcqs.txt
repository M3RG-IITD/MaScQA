The formula for the number of Schottky defects per mole is given by: 

$n = n_{A} exp\bigg(\frac{-Q}{RT}\bigg)$

where $n_{A}$ is Avogadro's number, $Q$ is the activation energy for the formation of the defect, $R$ is the universal gas constant, and $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.

Substituting the given values, we get:

$n = (6.023 * 10^(23)) * exp\bigg(\frac{-(250 * 10^(3))}{(8.314) * (300)}\bigg)$

$n = 1.21 * 10^(18)$

Therefore, the number of Schottky defects per mole of KCL at 300 Â°C under equilibrium condition is (A) 1.21 * $10^(18)$.
