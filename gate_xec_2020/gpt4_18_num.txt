First, we need to determine the magnetic moments for both Fe2+ and Fe3+ cations in terms of Bohr magnetons (µB). 

Fe has an atomic number of 26, meaning that it has 26 electrons. When it loses 2 electrons, it becomes Fe2+ with 24 electrons, with electronic configuration [Ar]3d6. When it loses 3 electrons, it becomes Fe3+ with 23 electrons, with electronic configuration [Ar]3d5.

Fe2+ has 4 unpaired electrons in the 3d orbitals, so the spin magnetic moment for Fe2+ can be calculated using the formula:

μ = √(n(n+2)) µB, where n is the number of unpaired electrons.

μ(Fe2+) = √(4(4+2)) = √24 µB

Fe3+ has 5 unpaired electrons in the 3d orbitals, so the spin magnetic moment for Fe3+ can be calculated as:

μ(Fe3+) = √(5(5+2)) = √35 µB

Now, we need to look at the distribution of cations in the Fe3O4 unit cell. 1/8 of the tetrahedral sites are occupied by half of the B cations (which in Fe3O4 are Fe3+), so there are:

0.5 * (1/8) = 1/16 Fe3+ cations in tetrahedral sites per unit cell

1/2 of the octahedral sites are occupied by remaining B (Fe3+) and A (Fe2+) cations, making them:

0.25 unit cells for Fe3+ and 0.25 unit cells for Fe2+

The net saturation magnetic moment per formula unit can be found by the difference between the magnetic moments in the octahedral and tetrahedral sites, multiplied by the number of cations in each site:

μsat = (μ(Fe2+) × 0.25) - (μ(Fe3+) × 1/16) + (μ(Fe3+) × 0.25)

μsat = (6 × 0.25) - (2.1875 × 1/16) + (7.745 × 0.25)

μsat = 1.5 - 0.13671875 + 1.93625

μsat = 3.29953125 µB

Therefore, the saturation magnetic moment of Fe3O4 per formula unit in terms of Bohr magnetons (µB) is approximately 3.3 µB.
